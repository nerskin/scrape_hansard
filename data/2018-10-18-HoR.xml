A circular has gone out from the department. The Department of Parliamentary Services has worked through the night and continues to work to restore systems. Just in the last 10 or 15 minutes, emails and some other systems have started to come back online, but it will take a few more hours yet for all systems to be restored. I want to thank members for their patience. In terms of the House itself, our systems here are unaffected in terms of bells, broadcasting and everything else. I just want to make that clear at the start. I do have a handwritten speakers list, which is nice!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, create a new equalisation benchmark, the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria (whichever is higher). All states will transition to this new equalisation standard over six years from 2021-22 to 2026-27.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, introduce a permanent in-system relativity floor of 0.7 from 2022-23, increasing to 0.75 from 2024-25.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, permanently boost the GST pool of funds available for distribution to the states and territories, providing direct Commonwealth cash injections each year from 2021-22 onwards. These are in addition to GST collections.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will enable an initial boost of $600 million in 2021-22 and a further $250 million boost in 2024-25, indexed each year to grow in line with the GST.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, during the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27, states and territories will be guaranteed the better of the old system or the new system. This means that, at the end of the transition period, each state and territory will have received the better of the cumulative total over the entire period of either the old system or the updated system. Payments will be verified annually by the Commonwealth Grants Commission over the transition period and any adjustments made accordingly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of this period in 2026-27, Australia will have a horizontal fiscal equalisation system that protects against economic shocks and provides a more stable source of revenue for all states and territories.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The horizontal fiscal equalisation 'fair go' principle has been an important part of our federal financial relations system since Federation. The government's horizontal fiscal equalisation reforms—implemented in this bill—continue to uphold this principle so that all Australians can have access to vital government services no matter where they live across this diverse country. All states will be better off, with the Commonwealth injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The GST pool from 2026-27 will grow by more than a billion dollars each and every year, compared to what would have occurred without these reforms. Importantly, the additional funding from the Commonwealth will not come at the expense of existing payments to the states and will be provided in perpetuity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth's projections use the Productivity Commission's estimates, which uses the numbers the states provided them. This additional funding is on top of another $6½ billion in GST receipts states will receive over the next four years as a result of decisions the government has taken since the 2015-16 budget. These include measures such as applying the GST to online purchases and other compliance measures. All that extra assistance is untied funding the states and territories can use to fund hospitals, schools and other essential services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has consulted extensively with all states on its proposal since the release of its interim response. But, unlike changes to the rate and the base of the GST, changes to the distribution of GST revenue do not require the approval of the states and territories. It is the Commonwealth's job to govern for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Prime Minister John Howard put this best when he said, 'I'm an Australian and, as far as I'm concerned, all Australians should be treated equally no matter where they live.' We have sought the bipartisan support from the opposition and we have made a sensible compromise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To provide certainty, the Commonwealth is now seeking to legislate these reforms by amending the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. In the end, the GST provides an important source of revenue to the states and territories; however, the viability of the system is only as good as the formula that underpins it and the economy in which it operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is seeing strong economic growth, record jobs creation and a federal budget that is on track for a return to surplus. This is not good luck but good management and a product of the policies the coalition has put in place. This positive momentum cannot be put at risk by the opposition's high-taxing and high-spending approach which threatens the reforms that we have underway. This is why the Morrison government and our GST reforms should be supported, because they will deliver real benefits to all Australians. We have provided a national solution to a national challenge. That is what leadership is about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's copyright system provides the legal basis for supporting Australia's creative industries and ensuring that they are viable and successful. It is an essential mechanism for rewarding the creative efforts of authors, artists and musicians, and the investors who take the risks to bring creative works to the market. Our copyright system balances incentives to create and disseminate new works by allowing fair access and use of these works by Australian consumers and other users for public policy benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has made two major updates to this system over the past three years. These updates have given the disability, education and cultural sectors enhanced use of copyright material. Those reforms were long overdue and necessary to enable those organisations to go about their normal functions without harming copyright owners. Now it is time to provide our creators and copyright industries with updated tools to ensure their creative efforts do not go unrewarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian film, television and music is a major success story, and the digital age has created opportunities for consumers to access this content in new and different ways. Streaming of content through providers such as Netflix, Stan and Spotify has opened up new ways of enjoying content. The government encourages the ongoing development and rollout of these legitimate platforms because they enable Australian creators and investors to be appropriately rewarded for their efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the internet continues to create major challenges for Australia's creative industries. Online copyright infringement reduces the livelihood of Australian creators and investors, and foreign based websites continue to illegally distribute the content of Australian copyright owners. The operators of these sites are often difficult to find and are located in countries that do not have strong copyright laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, the government introduced a website-blocking scheme in the Copyright Act 1968 to provide a means of addressing large-scale copyright infringement by overseas operators. The scheme has been successful. Since it was introduced, a number of sites have been blocked and there has been a reduction in the rate of online copyright infringement by Australian users. Research commissioned by the film industry shows that traffic to blocked sites in the months after blocking dropped by around 50 per cent. That is an encouraging result. But in an environment that is subject to continual change, we need to make sure our regulatory protections are up to date and effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's piracy rate still remains higher than in countries with strong copyright enforcement frameworks, such as the United Kingdom and Canada. There is still a proportion of Australian users who seek out infringing sites, and there are still pathways for them to get to these sites, including blocked sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February this year, the government reviewed the existing scheme to determine whether it was operating effectively. In general, this assessment found that the scheme is working well and that blocking arrangements have been implemented by carriage service providers with minimal disruption. However, there are some clear pressure points. First, search engines enable users to discover the existence of blocked websites and provide alternative pathways to get to those sites. Second, the types of online piracy have also become broader, with increased uses of sophisticated online locations, such as 'cyberlockers', that allow mass file-sharing. Third, new pathways to the blocked sites appear after the initial blocking, and these new pathways can't be blocked because they are not part of the original court order. Finally, it can be difficult and costly to determine whether an online location is, in fact, located overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill directly addresses these concerns. It will allow injunctions to be made against online search engines, who would be required to take reasonable steps to remove search results that refer users to an infringing online location. This will remove links that allow users to discover the existence of websites that may be the subject of an injunction. Some of these appear on the first page of search results, when they should not appear at all. Search engine results can also disclose alternate pathways to blocked websites, which can undermine the effectiveness of blocking orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will provide that an injunction may be granted in respect of an online location that has 'the primary purpose or the primary effect' of infringing, or facilitating an infringement, of copyright. This will ensure that some overseas online locations, such as certain 'cyberlockers', may be captured under the scheme. Some cyberlockers are widely used as sites for sharing infringing music and movie files. At the moment, there is doubt about whether these sites have the 'primary purpose' of infringing copyright, or facilitating the infringement of copyright. The bill will enable sites such as these to be brought within the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will make clear that the Federal Court has the power to issue responsive and adaptive injunctions, without the need for the copyright owner to go back to the court. This will give the court the power to grant injunctions on terms that allow the copyright owner and carriage service provider, by agreement, to apply the injunction to block other pathways that start to provide access to an infringing site. The bill will also introduce an evidentiary presumption that will provide that an online location is outside Australia, unless the contrary is proven.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of these measures will impede or affect the capacity for carriage service providers or search engine providers to voluntarily block or remove links to copyright infringing online locations. Indeed, if these voluntary arrangements are effective, injunctions are unlikely to be needed. However, these legislative changes provide an important fallback should industry initiatives prove to be inadequate or ineffective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is seeking quick passage of this bill so that Australia's creative industries can take action to protect their rights. These industries have put in place voluntary measures to make content more accessible and cheaper, and run education campaigns so that Australians are aware of the impact of piracy. It is now appropriate for the parliament to support these efforts by reforming our copyright website blocking scheme to ensure it is fit-for-purpose in a contemporary digital media environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with pleasure that I move the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need access to safe and effective agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines. They protect our crops, livestock and domestic pets; safeguard our environment from invasive weeds and pests; and meet consumer needs for things such as household insecticides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agvet chemicals, as these products are commonly known, have brought long-term benefits to Australian agriculture by supporting increasing productivity, better quality produce and more competitive industries. Agvet chemicals will play an important part in helping our agriculture sector achieve the $60 billion worth of farm production forecast in 2018-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the regulation of agvet chemicals continues to be streamlined to maximise the benefits for all Australians. It is also imperative to ensure that the strong safeguards built into the regulation of agvet chemicals are not compromised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through a cooperative scheme with the states and territories, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority—the APVMA—is the national regulator of agvet chemicals up to, and including, the point of supply. The APVMA has an important role in ensuring that agvet chemicals supplied in Australia are safe for people, animals, plants and the environment, and don't adversely impact our trade market access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The APVMA also needs to be efficient and effective in its regulation of agvet chemicals. This bill furthers these objectives by streamlining regulatory processes, while retaining protections for the health and safety of humans, animals and the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes changes to enable the use of new, simpler processes for chemical product assessment based on risk. These changes support improved access to safe and effective chemical products and reduce costs associated with their registration. They do this by better aligning regulatory effort with risk and reducing red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill specifically provides for new prescribed approval and registration processes that will be quicker and less costly than those currently available, while also ensuring these products remain safe and effective. These new processes will apply for those active constituents, chemical products and labels that require minimal or no assessment of technical information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure has the potential to free up the time of the APVMA's assessors so they can focus on more complex assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for incentives for registration holders to include certain uses of chemical products on labels that they would not ordinarily register. This will encourage more minor and priority uses to be added to labels, where the costs of adding those are not justified by the additional commercial returns to chemical manufacturers. For example, where a chemical product is needed to control pests in a high-value, low volume export crop   or where a chemical product is needed for a niche crop or to deal with a particular regional pest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These uses will improve productivity for farmers by allowing access to a wider range of safe and effective agricultural chemicals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similar to the approaches applied internationally, the incentives in the bill operate by extending data protection periods on information for up to five years, if certain uses—such as minor and priority uses—are included on labels. These extensions would be prescribed in the regulations. Based on the experience of these incentives overseas, this could encourage more uses on labels, with significant benefits to Australian farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further measure in the bill provides for a disallowable instrument to be made by the APVMA in the future to prescribe a scheme for accredited third party assessment providers. This gives the APVMA the flexibility to implement a scheme that allows applicants and the APVMA to use accredited third party providers to undertake assessment services. It ensures though, that the APVMA remains the decision-maker in respect to approvals and registrations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes measures to improve risk communication about chemical products. This increases the transparency of voluntary recalls of agvet chemicals, and modernises the legislation so the reporting obligations are clear for persons recalling these chemicals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional measures in the bill address some deficiencies or inconsistencies in the regulation of agvet chemicals. These are largely minor issues. However, when considered together, they improve the operational efficiency of the APVMA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in the bill represent a considered approach to improving agvet legislation and have been developed through a program of engagement with stakeholders. The bill has been consulted on publicly and this consultation has confirmed that the bill will deliver benefits to industry, the regulator and our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the national system for regulating agvet chemicals, while ensuring safe and effective agvet chemicals continue to be available to our community. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2017-18 Budget, the government announced that it would establish the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC), a new independent corporate Commonwealth entity, to operate an affordable housing bond aggregator to provide cheaper and longer-term finance for community housing providers. This was intended to ensure that Australians, particularly vulnerable Australians, have more opportunities to access affordable housing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements this bipartisan commitment by making explicit that the board of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation must collectively have an appropriate balance of qualifications, skills and experience in a relevant field (being banking and finance, law, housing, infrastructure planning and financing, local government, and public policy), and that at least one board member must have appropriate qualifications, skills or experience in social or affordable housing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for the statutory review of the operation of the NHFIC Act to occur after the period of two years from the commencement of the act, rather than three.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the government is bringing forward planned annual appropriations for the purpose of the affordable housing bond aggregator to allow NHFIC to redraw amounts repaid to the Commonwealth. The amendments ensure that NHFIC is better placed to respond to demands from community housing providers. The amendments also provide certainty over NHFIC's available finance in future years so it can commit to potential loan transactions. To facilitate this, the bill provides for the creation of a special account for the purposes of the $1 billion line of credit appropriated to the Department of Treasury for the bond aggregator function of NHFIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon the commencement of the bill, the $150 million already appropriated to the Commonwealth for the purpose of the affordable housing bond aggregator is credited to the special account. The bill also appropriates the remaining $850 million of the $1 billion line of credit, which is to be credited to the special account over four years from the commencement of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments fulfil the original intent for line of credit to be ongoing, by providing for the $1 billion to be reused and by avoiding the lapsing of any undrawn funds three years after appropriation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help secure and improve NHFIC, who play a key part in the government's plan to help reduce pressure on housing affordability.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report, incorporating additional comments, which I will remark upon in a moment, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Report 472:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth procurement—second report</span>.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I will keep my remarks fairly succinct because there is a lot to say on this report. It covers a huge range of turf—we have been working on it since February. It will be referred to the Federation Chamber for further statements. To precis and signal some of the issues, because members may wish to add their names to the speaking list for further consideration: this is the committee's second report on Commonwealth procurement. It sets out the findings of the committee's inquiry, which is based on three individual ANAO audit reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chapter 2 of the report discusses the committee's findings on Audit report No. 12 of 2017-18, concerning contract management of the telephone universal service obligation by the Department of Communications and the Arts. The Audit Office raised a range of concerns, including value-for-money principles, and concluded that the department had not actively managed the contract towards achieving value for money. The committee was unanimous in that section of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would note that there is a strong tradition of bipartisanship in this committee. Over the 100 years or so that it's existed there have been very few dissenting reports. It's the mechanism through which the parliament holds the Public Service to account for the expenditure of public money and public administration. However, for the first time in some years now, whilst the committee signed off on the substantive report, we did reach a point after some months of consideration where some members of the committee felt the need to make additional comments which were not agreed to by all members of the committee. They are in relation to the second two ANAO reports that we considered. In just touching on those, I would note the statement by the chair of the committee, Senator Smith, and thank him for his acknowledgement that he regards this as the committee working as it should. We did sign off on the substance of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chapter 3 of the report discusses the committee's findings on Audit report No. 9 of 2017-18, concerning management of the preconstruction phase of the Inland Rail program by the Australian Rail Track Corporation. The report reveals through the inquiry some serious concerns regarding the financing and delivery of the $10 billion Inland Rail project. As is well known, it still fails to connect trains to the Port of Brisbane and, curiously, it is being financed by the government off budget, rather than by a grant using an equity injection of some billions of dollars to the ARTC. Just to record two quotes, this should mean—I quote the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Finance in the inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government needs to get a real rate of return on the project over the life of the project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, astoundingly, through the inquiry we heard the former CEO of the ARTC, John Fullerton, admit clearly to the committee under questioning in a public hearing that the project is never likely to repay its capital cost and provide a return to the government. He stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… no, the revenues that flow to us wouldn't cover the full capital cost and provide a return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite questioning, the committee was not able to be assured of or given access to information, even in confidence, that provides an understanding of the expected rate of return of such a significant, multibillion-dollar investment. The point that is made in the additional comments is that, if such investments in rail projects outside the general government sector of the budget were used in this way on a wider scale, this would seriously risk decreasing the profitability of government entities and dividends to government, repayment of their capital and net value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's a range of concerns raised in the additional comments about the lack of transparency by the ARTC, which point blank refused to address a range of questions that the committee had and hid behind what I consider a spurious defence of legal professional privilege. It's well known in the practice of the Senate and the House that legal professional privilege is not to be used as an excuse to not provide information to the parliament, but we were not able to pursue that further. So, more can be said in the Federation Chamber on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final part of the report is chapter 4, which discusses the committee's findings on Audit report No. 61 2016-17, concerning the procurement of the rather controversial National Cancer Screening Register by the Department of Health. Overall, I consider this a scathing report. It was a unanimous report by a government-controlled committee, which, in my words, slammed the government's failure to deliver the lifesaving National Cancer Screening Register for cervical and bowel cancer. In a recommendation—quite astounding—the committee recommended that the government consider terminating this bungled $222 million contract with Telstra Health. It has been disastrously handled over the last few years. It's cost taxpayers millions, as the committee was told, and risked the lives of Australian women due to delays with the new Cervical Cancer Screening Program, which is replacing the former Pap smear test. The failings are so serious that the unanimous report recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">whether, in the circumstances of such serious underperformance by Telstra Health, it may be in the Commonwealth's interests to terminate the contract and pursue other options …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this contract was rushed into just days before the 2016 election, with a questionable contract signed after a dodgy tender process in which senior health department staff who owned Telstra shares did not declare them when voting on the tender panel. The tender evaluation process was so flawed that the department could not rule out the possibility that, if they'd followed their own procedures in the tender evaluation plan, Telstra Health may not even have been awarded the contract.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the urgency to privatise this register before the 2016 election, we also note that the bowel cancer screening component is nowhere to be found, lost in a dark place, no movement, and the old paper-based system continues. Telstra Health and the Department of Health cannot even guess when the new Bowel Cancer Screening Program might commence, which has left the committee to order six-monthly report-backs on progress until they find out what's going on and can tell us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also noted concerns during the inquiry—the subject of much questioning—regarding the impact of the lengthy delay on mortality rates of Australian women. It was a rather <span style="font-style:italic;">Fawlty Towers</span>-<span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span> kind of episode, because, very clearly, the new register and the HPV tests were intended to 'prevent an additional 140 cervical cancers each year and decrease mortality and morbidity rates by at least test 15 per cent'. That's from the government's explanatory memorandum. Then there were the press releases from the member for Farrer, when she was the minister, telling us how urgent it was that we privatise this register and pass the legislation. Mysteriously, nothing's happened since they signed this dodgy contract with Telstra Health, and yet they're trying to claim that no women would have died and no new cancers would have been created. So, I think there's more to be said in the Federation Chamber on this. I commend the report to the House and I move: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the House take note of the report.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This report gives an account of the visit by a delegation of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to India and Indonesia in August, under the program of committee visits to the Asia-Pacific region. In its letter requesting the visit, the committee noted that Australia is currently negotiating trade agreements with both India and Indonesia. As a result, JSCOT believed the delegation would enhance its ability to examine these treaties—and other trade agreements—in any future inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the 22 years of JSCOT's operation, several themes have emerged from inquires into trade and economic cooperation agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aims and objectives of the delegation were: to inquire into the challenges and rewards of Australian businesses accessing, or attempting to access, the Indian and Indonesian markets; to examine the broader economic context of both India and Indonesia, including opportunities for Australia's further investment and trade; to obtain detailed information on the perspectives of both the Indian and Indonesian executive governments; to examine the mechanisms for parliamentary oversight of treaties, trade and foreign affairs; to identify successful examples of Australian businesses in Indonesia and Indian markets; and to ascertain the factors or criteria that contributed to their success. Discussions were had while we were there with a broad range of government, parliamentary, local and Australian businesses, and these gave the delegation a very nuanced picture of the trade and investment relationships in both countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation expected India to be multifaceted and complex. Even so, the delegation was struck by the sheer scale of the Indian economy, by the complicated regulatory environment and by the cultural and economic differences across the states. This complicated political and economic environment underpinned everything that we, as the delegation, saw and heard, and explains that this complexity requires a careful process of negotiation. The delegation really saw that the opportunities in India for mutual benefit are great and growing, and JSCOT now has a much better understanding of both the trade agreement process and the steps that will be required for Australian businesses to really take full advantage of the opportunities in India.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Indonesia, we had the opportunity to gain a different perspective on Australia's international trade relationships. We are really pleased to see that since the visit Australia and Indonesia have successfully concluded negotiations on the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. It's clear that there is potential to strengthen our economic and security cooperation with one of our major trading partners, that being of course, Indonesia. It is a country that has tremendous potential for economic growth, and the delegation was particularly pleased to meet with New Colombo Plan scholars and to see the growth of person-to-person—people-to-people—contacts and links to match our already strong links in security, tourism and education in Indonesia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation would like to thank DFAT officers for what was exceptional support provided by them in each location—a great program—and to thank everyone who made the time to meet the delegation with the warm hospitality the delegation was shown on so many occasions. We appreciated not only the expertise but the exceptional candour and frank assessments of everyone who we spoke to and who spoke to us. I want to acknowledge all the members of the delegation for their time and effort, and thank them for all the time they put into this particular delegation. I want to thank the then chair and also the secretary, Lynley Ducker, for her outstanding efforts during this delegation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It really was a great privilege for the delegation to travel and engage at a personal level with a wide variety of people and organisations. We not only heard about India and Indonesia but also had the opportunity to explain the parliamentary role and the important oversight that is conducted by JSCOT. I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  by leave—I want to join the Chief Government Whip in expressing my appreciation of this important visit by JSCOT to India and Indonesia. Unfortunately, I was only able to participate in the Indian section of the visit. I think that as Australian MPs we learnt a great deal of important things, particularly from my point of view, about India.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We observed the Indian parliament in action, and it was a particularly interesting session that we attended. There was a debate on a proposed amendment to their constitution, with a 123-amendment bill. The bill sought to grant constitutional status to the National Commission on Backward Classes. That sounds a pretty arcane term in this parliament, but it refers to castes which are socially, educationally and economically disadvantaged. It is very interesting to see, as part of India's progress, that the disadvantaged castes are being legally addressed by the Lok Sabha and are being brought into equality—a very, very good thing from India's point of view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a chance, as the Chief Government Whip said, to observe economic reform in that great country and to look at the possibility of a free trade agreement with Australia. I have to report—I think it was the view of the delegation—that that FTA is going to take a great deal of further work, because most of the Indian economic policymakers were interested in focusing on their huge economy rather than even trade with the outside world or the importance of FTAs with Australia or, indeed, other countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say, however, from our meetings with Australian businesspeople operating in India, that the abolition of different GSTs by states and the consolidation of them by the Lok Sabha has had an amazingly productive effect—just like the change in the Indian currency. The Indian government is to be congratulated on doing this, and it's made the doing of business between states in India—some of which, of course, are bigger than Australia, certainly in population size—a great deal easier, and we heard many commendations from Australian businesses about the benefit of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had an extraordinary insight into Indian culture. We had a tour of the National Gallery of Modern Art in India under the auspices of Adwaita Gadanayak, who was a great host. Also, in Mumbai, we met the Governor of Maharashtra, C Vidyasagar Rao, who took us through the governor's palace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last point I would make is that we also gained an extraordinary insight into the political developments in Pakistan, being very close to them at the time of their national election. The widespread view was that the new Prime Minister of Pakistan is very close to the Pakistan Army and that little progress can be expected of the new government of Pakistan, in engagement on security issues with India and the rest of the world, unless the Pakistan Army is involved in those discussions, because the impression, certainly throughout India, was that they were the people strongly behind him.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  This bill, the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, seeks to clarify legal questions concerning the nature of marine orders made by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Its practical effect would be to ensure that marine orders have the same legal status as regulations, including that they include penalties for noncompliance. The changes make sense, and they have my support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where there is confusion or doubt on whether the legislation accurately reflects the intentions of the parliament, we must make whatever changes are necessary to clarify the collective will of this parliament. Indeed, we should always ensure that parliament provides the community with certainty in the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, while we're considering this important issue, we should also reflect on our responsibility to provide certainty over the existence of an Australian shipping industry and certainty as to the jobs that Australians rely upon. For the past five years, this government has undermined Australian shipping, seeking to expose it to unfair competition in coastal trade from foreign-flagged vessels paying their crews third-world wages. This has created five years of uncertainty for the Australian shipping industry and Australian seafarers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always support changes that enhance Australian shipping, create jobs or, as is the case today, amend legislation to clarify legal ambiguities. But what we won't do is undermine Australian industry and undermine Australian jobs. Put simply, those opposite want to replace the Australian flag on the back of Australian ships with the white flag of surrender when it comes to Australian jobs. That is the wrong approach. We should be nurturing the Australian shipping industry. We should be promoting job creation and job security. That's the principle behind the amendment that I will now move. I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I outline the context of this legislation that's before the House today? The Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 and the Navigation Act 2012 give AMSA the ability to make what are known as marine orders. Marine orders are designed to be legislative instruments allowing AMSA, as the regulator, to keep pace with developments in a rapidly changing industry. Essentially, the idea is that these regulations can be changed at periods of time in order to ensure that the appropriate regulatory regime is kept up-to-date and that there is certainty and consistency. Indeed, when the Navigation Act 2012 was introduced, it replaced the Navigation Act 1912—for 100 years we'd sat on that legislation. It took a Labor government to modernise the legislation that covered Australian shipping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Marine orders are generally practical in their nature. For example, marine order 15 relates to fire protection for ships. Marine order 17 concerns regulations for carrying dangerous liquids. The original intention of marine orders, as defined in the Navigation Act 2012, was that they would be legally enforceable and, particularly, would include a provision for penalties for noncompliance. However, the government has lately faced some legal questions concerning the enforcement of marine orders. This legislation clarifies the situation by giving marine orders the status of regulations, as was the original intention. The amendment to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 inserts a definition for 'regulations' that includes marine orders, with relevant exceptions. The amendment to the Navigation Act 2012 makes the same change. Labor supports these changes. There's no room for legal ambiguity over issues such as the ones that I raise: fire protection and the carriage of dangerous liquids. These are not issues of partisan disagreement; they are issues of common sense. As the national regulator, AMSA does a very good job in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament should also provide clarity over the security of the Australian coastal shipping industry, because the existence of this sector is fundamental to our national interest, given that we are an island continent. Yet, from the moment the coalition took office, and indeed before that, they have sought to undermine the industry. They want to cut costs, without any regard to whether that cost cutting is actually real. It is so dedicated to undermining the people who work in the Australian industry who happen to be members of trade unions that their solution to eliminating members of the maritime sector who are trade unionists is to eliminate the jobs that exist. That's their plan. No maritime sector? No Maritime Union of Australia. This is the logical conclusion of anyone who actually looks at the legislation that's been put forward by the government opposite. Tragically, it has been the National Party that has been in charge of this—the National Party, the party whose name implies standing up for the national interest, the party which historically arose out of an approach, in part, to protectionism and regulation of Australian industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we don't say that there should be a protectionist model in the Australian shipping industry. We don't go the way that many countries have gone—for example, the United States with the Jones Act, where, if you want to take goods from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you have to have a US flagged ship built in the US and with US seafarers on it. It is a completely closed system for their coastal shipping. Indeed, Australia has one of the most open systems in the world. But what we don't support is the idea that an Australian flagged ship should have to compete with a foreign flagged ship with fewer regulations, less maintenance and less wages, because we know that that isn't a level playing field. That's why the 2012 reforms sought to genuinely have a level playing field through a range of measures, including taxation measures, so that the cost differential between a ship that was flagged in a Third World country or a country like Singapore that has a zero rate of taxation would not be at an advantage over an Australian ship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the changes that were sought in 2015 were about eliminating the Australian shipping industry. It actually said it in the regulatory impact statement, where it said that 93 per cent of the savings that were estimated to result from that legislation were a direct result of the difference between Australian wages and foreign wages. It also said that it anticipated that the Australian flag would be removed from ships and be replaced by foreign flags. We saw that in really practical and specific terms as the debate went on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perth businessman Bill Milby of North Star Cruises came to a seminar. In all of the seminars and launches of this policy the big hint was where the National Party ministers launched the policy. They launched it at events hosted by the foreign shippers. It was a bit of a hint. It's a bit like when Pauline Hanson moves a resolution on race: you kind of know where that's going. So you launch a policy that you say is about the Australian shipping industry and you launch it at an event hosted by foreign shippers—and, of course, foreign shippers are called Shipping Australia. That's what the foreign shipping organisation is called, because they know that it's untenable not to be seen to be supporting Australian shipping, because most Australians would think it's just a bit of common sense to have an Australian shipping industry as we are an island continent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Milby, a quite successful businessman and owner of North Star Cruises, goes along to this forum. He's listening to what these reforms are and he's a smart fellow. This business has been operating up around the Kimberley very successfully. It has been employing Australians and bringing dollars into the Australian economy from international visitors who, as Mr Milby says, actually want to hear an Australian accent while they're travelling around the pristine areas of the Kimberley and northern Australia. He has provided employment for crew, for cooks and for all the people who work for his company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes up to the deputy secretary of the department and says: 'I can't see how, if these changes come in, I can compete. How can I possibly compete?' and he is told, 'Well, this is how you compete: you replace the Australian flag on the back of your vessels with a foreign flag and you replace your Australian staff with staff from the Philippines or some other nation. That's how you compete.' That's what he was told. He gave this evidence at the Senate committee into the legislation. He has said this outside of parliament as well. We know it's true because the legislation said it was in the regulatory impact statement. Quite extraordinary. Here we had an Australian government proposing legislation and providing advice to businesses that was specifically designed to put Australians out of work. In more than two decades in this place, I've never seen such a flagrant betrayal of the national interest by representatives in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fact is that crossbench senators wouldn't have a bar of it. They put the national interest first. Former Senator Nick Xenophon, when I went to see him about the legislation, said, 'Well, I always vote for second readings.' In general, the crossbench has had a view that you vote for the second reading—not the amendments; the second reading—because it allows for further debate. It may well be that there are amendments that make legislation acceptable. But what happened with this legislation is it didn't even get a second reading. That's how bad it was. That doesn't happen too often in the Senate. I've dealt with a range of legislation in my portfolio, and it's the only time I can remember that they just said, 'No, go away; this is absurd.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month there was another tranche of legislation debated here in the House of Representatives. They came back. We had Minister Truss introduce the first legislation. Then we had Minister Chester introduce the second bit of legislation. We had Minister Joyce sit on the legislation. Then we had Minister McCormack. It's a revolving door. This mob speak about the parliament. I'd like to be able to say to the House that I, as shadow minister, am the best shadow minister there's ever been because I knock over a minister every few months. But I can't, in all honesty, say that this isn't self-inflicted as much as anything else. The fact is that last month we had debate on the latest tranche of legislation, maritime legislation from 2016. It took from 2016 to 2018 to get a second reading debate in this place. They'll go through another four ministers before it gets to the Senate. It's just extraordinary. The fact is, in spite of the government saying that they'll consult with Labor about shipping legislation, they essentially haven't sought to get any bipartisanship—you have one meeting, then the next time there's a new minister. Maritime Industry Australia Limited, MIAL, the peak industry body, a bunch of businessmen involved in an industry, regard the government as having treated them with contempt, because the consultation for the new legislation was all with the foreign shippers rather than with them as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we need a shipping industry? Firstly, of course, it's clearly in our national economic interest. We are a maritime nation. Most of our exports and imports, close to 99 per cent of them, come and leave via our coast on ships. We rely on the maritime sector to train the people who become harbour masters and run our ports. It is essential for our national economy that those skills be maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there is the issue of our environment. We know that every time a major incident has occurred—<span style="font-style:italic;">Shen Neng;</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Pacific Adventurer—</span>they have something in common: there's a foreign flag on the back of the ship. People aren't as familiar with our coastlines, with the pristine nature of our reefs. The accidents that have occurred have caused great damage, but the potential is there for a catastrophic event that would have enormous impact on our national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third reason is national security. There's a direct link between the defence industry and our merchant fleet. That's why, when we established an organisation to look at the maritime workforce development, we had the Navy represented on it. It was chaired by a former Public Service Commissioner. We had the Navy, we had the Australian shipping industry, we had the Maritime Union of Australia, we had the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers and we had the Australian Maritime College down at Launceston. They all came up with a plan for workforce development, a common interest. They had funding of just $5 million from the government to make this plan work. What did this government do when they came to office? They scrapped it. They took the $5 million and scrapped the plan. The fact is that there is a direct link, and, in times of conflict, the merchant fleet has suffered great losses—during World War II, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government speak about national security, when they speak about us stopping boats, we didn't think that meant stopping ships with an Australian flag on the back, but that's precisely what they've done. They've done it through abuse of the existing regulations. Take, for example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span>.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span> operated from Portland in Victoria, where the refinery is, picking up the natural resources from over in Western Australia and essentially going to and fro with the natural resources, down to Portland and back again. There was nothing temporary about it. It was a permanent, two-destination voyage that had operated for many years. Yet this government allowed it to be replaced with a foreign-flagged vessel with a foreign crew. The government said that the journey and those regional jobs based in regional Victoria could be replaced by jobs offshore in the Philippines and other destinations. Somehow that was temporary. It's just a complete abuse of the legislation; it's an outrageous indictment of the government's failure to implement what is the law. Yet the government, of course, were completely determined to do that, because they don't seem to understand the synergy which is there between our naval and our merchant fleets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Australian seafarers undergo very stringent background checks. They have to have an MSIC. Foreign seafarers don't have MSICs, but they operate in our ports and in our harbours. The government should think about where ships are, what they have on board and the potential issue for national security that this represents if the proper checks aren't made. I say to the government: don't say that you didn't know about it if there is an incident. Don't say it, because this is called <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> and I'm saying in it that there are national security interests in Australia having an Australian fleet operating around our coasts. And don't say that you don't understand the economic reasons for why we need an Australian shipping industry. Don't say that you're not aware of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pasha Bulker</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Shandong Hai Wang</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacific Adventurer</span> and, in New Zealand, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rena</span>, which I flew over with the New Zealand transport minister. Essentially, that incident had an enormously damaging impact on the environment and also on the economy of the region around Auckland and the north coast of the North Island of New Zealand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that Labor does understand the importance of the shipping sector and the need to provide Australian seafarers with secure work. In government we created the Australian International Shipping Register, allowing operators of Australian-flagged vessels to employ mixed Australian and foreign crews on internationally agreed rates and conditions. We enacted the first major rewrite of the nation's maritime laws. That was consistent with the other work that we did on the National Ports Strategy. We made sure that the oil companies pay for any and all damage their ships may cause. We had to fix legislation to fix that. We replaced the myriad laws that operated separately from state to state with just one national regulator administering one set of modern nationwide laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, the coalition have completely undermined the Australian shipping industry. As I said at the outset, I'm all for certainty in legislation, but I'm also an advocate for job certainty for Australian seafarers and investment certainty for the Australian shipping industry. It is in Australia's economic, environmental and national security interests to maintain a vibrant Australian shipping industry. It is also the case—to give a comparison that I think is appropriate—that, if you want to take freight from Sydney to Melbourne down the highway, you use a truck that's registered in Australia; you have a truck driver with an Australian licence; and you are obligated to pay Australian wages. If you take those same goods down the blue highway, which is free from Sydney to Melbourne, you can have a foreign-flagged ship with foreign wages and foreign conditions, regardless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What that does as well, as the Australian rail industry has pointed out, is to distort the market across transport modes towards foreign ships. That's over Australian jobs in the rail sector, in particular, but also in the roads sector. That's a distortion that, again, undermines Australian conditions and wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to compete in the Asian century, we can't compete on the basis of how low we can drive our wages. We need to compete on the basis of how smart we are, how innovative we are, how creative we are as a nation—creating the jobs of the future. This government doesn't seem to understand that. In spite of the Reserve Bank saying that wages being reduced in real terms is a problem for the national economy, in areas like this what we see is that they have contempt for Australian industrial conditions.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  I second the amendment. It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak to this bill and particularly to the amendment moved by the shadow minister. I will always get to my feet whenever I can to speak on coastal trading and the maritime fleet in Australia. What's happened under this government and, indeed, under the previous Howard government with respect to our maritime fleet and our maritime workers has been a disgrace in terms of jobs and, particularly, national security and fuel security, which I'll come to a little bit later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is an island continent, surrounded by water in every direction—north, south, east, west. My own state is an island state of our island country, and we recognise our geographical peculiarity in our national anthem, noting 'Our home is girt by sea'. Unless you fly, the only way to get here is by sea. You cannot drive or walk to Australia from any other country in the world, and in this we are unique. Every other country in the world you can get to by land; this is the only country inhabiting an entire continent and it requires either a plane or a ship to get to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that, as an island connected to other nations only by water and air, Australia would have a maritime flee the envy of the world, developed over 200 years of colonial, intercolonial, interstate and international trade. You would think that Australia would be producing the world's best maritime engineers, world-class shipbuilders, the best civilian sailors and officers, the best technicians, the best navigators not only for an Australian fleet but to send out to the world to give the world the best-trained maritime fleet officers and staff. But no. Our maritime fleet in Australia is all but in mothballs, sacrificed on the altar of neoliberalism. Our maritime self-reliance has lost out to greedy corporations and multinationals and to foolish coalition governments more interested in saving a few dollars in sailors' wages than in protecting our national security. We have a government that has absolutely destroyed our domestic shipping industry and annihilated our domestic maritime fleet. For some reason, the coalition—those opposite—has never seen the benefit that these industries offer to Australia and to our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a function at the parliament this week with the Maritime Industry Australia Limited representatives the shadow minister talked about earlier in his speech. At that occasion, the Minister for Defence turned up and extolled the virtues of what he was doing with the Defence program, the shipbuilding, the subs and all that. People were looking on thinking, 'What on earth is this guy talking about?' These were representatives of commercial shipbuilders, and he was going on about a naval shipbuilding program. They could only look on in wonder and think, 'We're missing out on this.' Why can't the minister and this government see that our Defence capabilities are just as important as our merchant capabilities? They just don't see it. They are blind to the implications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, they turn a blind eye to the absolute rorting of the temporary licences for foreign vessels in Australian waters. Australia's coastal shipping industry, under various Liberal governments since Howard, has eroded and virtually disappeared. The shadow minister made reference to the <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ortland</span>, a vessel that travelled the same route between Western Australia and Victoria for 27 years. It was crewed by Australians and flagged as an Australian vessel, but, under this government—under those opposite—it's been allowed to be deflagged and recrewed by foreign crews under foreign conditions, despite plying a domestic route.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the sea route that it took was just a few kilometres inland, it wouldn't be allowed. It would be illegal to have foreign workers on foreign conditions on a foreign registered vessel adhering to foreign maintenance standards using Australian land based conditions and roads. It would be disallowed. We require that vehicles on Australian roads and Australian highways adhere to Australian conditions and Australian law, but, somehow, even though it's still in Australia but on the water, all those rules are out the window. And why? It's because you save a few dollars in wages. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My own state was the sorry last resting place of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alexander Spirit</span>, the very last Australian crewed fuel tanker, where a crew was basically forcibly removed and told: 'That's it. We're replacing you with foreign crews.' Australia no longer has fuel delivered to Australia by Australians. What does that do to our fuel security? It means we are entirely reliant on foreign nationals and foreign crews in foreign vessels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill. As the shadow minister has said, marine orders are critical to the successful operations of ships that come to Australia, and, as such, those marine orders need to be enforceable. There need to be penalties for noncompliance and there needs to be clarity. They are critical components of the successful and safe operation of ships. As regulations made under Commonwealth legislation, marine orders are a flexible instrument that allow our laws to keep pace with the often fast-paced technical and technological change in marine safety and implement Australia's international maritime obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia currently has two series of marine orders. One is marine order 198, which generally fulfils our international obligations and expectations and applies to Australian and foreign vessels, as well as some domestic commercial ships. We also have marine orders 500 to 507, which apply solely to domestic commercial vessels. Marine orders dictate behaviour and activity on a range of issues, including fire and emergency safety, garbage and waste disposal, working and living conditions, skill and health requirements for crew, and safe navigation and traffic processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All industries are governed by regulations. Whether they be specific to safety requirements or environmental management, they are important components of industry operations. Marine orders, in particular, provide flexible and responsive measures that can fill gaps not filled explicitly by legislation. Marine orders are created by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, who delegates their enforcement to a range of AMSA staff. This bill offers sensible and necessary reform. There can be no question, and there must be no question, of the legal authority or enforceability of marine orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to the second reading amendment. This government has overseen the demise of our fleet and our capability as a merchant marine nation. I just can't believe what it's done. The shadow minister is similarly aghast at how those opposite almost take perverse pride in what they've achieved with their coastal shipping legislation.</span>

                    </a>  No, no. Don't mislead the House. Your coastal trading legislation is decimating Australia's maritime capability. What we on this side of the House did in 2012 was introduce legislation that allowed for temporary licences—temporary licences—which those opposite, in government, have absolutely rorted. As the shadow minister alluded to, we had a system which was a commonsense system whereby foreign vessels importing goods into this country could, upon bringing their goods in, move from one port to another port with the same crew—without having to replace the entire crew with Australians. They were from another country, they'd dropped off their cargo, and they could make another trip on a domestic route. That was a sensible allowance under the temporary licence. What those opposite have allowed is for foreign vessels to come in and then do business, almost exclusively, around the coastal trading routes. That's a big difference, and it's killed the maritime fleet in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come briefly to an exceptional speech given at the Australian Naval Institute by Lieutenant Commander Desmond Woods. He gave this speech at the Australian merchant navy day of remembrance on 8 April this year. He spoke at some length about the contribution of the merchant fleet in wartime. It's often forgotten and neglected when we come to remember those who've sacrificed everything for the nation. We often forget the contribution of the merchant fleet, and the men and women of the fleet. Lieutenant Commander Woods said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Merchant Navy of the whole British Empire, which included the Australian Merchant Fleet, suffered proportionately the highest casualties of any of the allied services in the Second World War. Thirty thousand two hundred and forty eight British Empire merchant seamen who served at sea under the red ensign lost their lives doing so. The Australian Department of Veterans Affairs nominal roll records 3,500 Australian merchant seamen serving in World War II in Australian registered ships. The Australian War Memorial has placed the names of 845 of them, who are known to have died on war service during World War II, on the commemorative roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are men, and perhaps some women, who didn't take up arms. They were serving in the merchant fleet during wartime and they died during their service. They were absolutely some of the bravest men and women this country has ever seen. We'll never know the true number of Australians who died, because there were many who served in British and international fleets and they're not included among those 845.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution of the merchant fleet is often forgotten when, on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, we come to teach schoolchildren about the contribution of our armed services. We often forget the merchant seamen. I'm pleased to say that the War Memorial and the official records don't forget them; they are appropriately recognised in official records. But, in the national consciousness, we often forget the contribution of our merchant seamen. They have made an incredible contribution to this country, and it must never be forgotten.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This omission from the national recollection is most profoundly true of the period of the campaign in New Guinea in 1942. Those brutal battles on the Kokoda track were finally won because the Japanese army was cut off from re-supply and was starved into retreating. First Australian and later also American troops in the jungle and on the northern beaches at Gona and Buna were supplied with bread and bombs, bacon and bullets and fuel in vast quantities from the sea and were therefore able to take the fight back to the Japanese. New Guinea was won back from the enemy by the combination of the matchless courage and endurance of young soldiers and airman ashore and by the merchant seamen afloat who supplied them and the RAN who escorted those ships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A combined national effort won that iconic battle that turned the tide in that great struggle. It wouldn't have happened without the contribution of the merchant fleet. But where is that merchant fleet today? If we were to have a conflict of that magnitude on our doorstep today, would we be able to resupply our troops from an Australian maritime merchant fleet? No, we would not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I support the shadow minister's second reading amendment. We must do all we can to rebuild our merchant fleet and support the men and women of Australia's maritime industry.</span>

These acts establish key parts of Australia's regulatory framework for maritime safety and protection of the marine environment. Primarily, the bill will insert a definition of the term 'regulations' into each act, to clarify that this term includes legislative instruments known as marine orders. This clarification is necessary to ensure the regulatory framework operates as intended. Provisions of each act rely on vessel owners and individual seafarers operating or working on vessels complying with requirements of regulations, such as requirements to hold valid safety or pollution certificates. The bill provides important legal clarity and certainty that existing obligations and requirements for individual seafarers and vessel owners include requirements set out in marine orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practical terms, the machinery changes made by the bill will have no impact on maritime industries operating under these acts. Individual seafarers and vessel owners will continue to comply with the same requirements set out under the existing acts, regulations and marine orders in the same manner as today and continue to be subject to the existing compliance framework. Use of marine orders is a longstanding practice to deal with detailed technical and operational requirements and processes and to give effect to international obligations and standards. Australia's maritime industries are familiar with this practice. Marine orders are used to set out potentially complex standards and requirements in the clearest and simplest manner possible, to help the maritime industry to understand and comply with their obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Use of marine orders also ensures these requirements are set out in a consistent and familiar way which is easily and freely accessible in one place on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's website. They are also registered and freely available on the Federal Register of Legislation. Marine orders are legislative instruments for the purpose of the Legislation Act 2003, which means that they are subject to crucial parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. Importantly, the explanatory memoranda for the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 and Navigation Bill 2012 make clear that policymakers intended marine orders, rather than the acts or regulations, to continue to be used to set out these operational and technical matters and requirements, in line with longstanding regulatory practice. This bill gives effect to that intent.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments made by this bill will ensure Australia's regulatory framework for maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment continues to function as intended—efficiently, effectively and consistent with international law. This framework is vital to ensure the safe operation of vessels in Australia's waters and to ensure seafarers and passengers aboard these vessels return home safely.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This framework is also vital for protecting Australia's pristine coastal and marine environments, including our internationally recognised areas of outstanding national significance, such as the Great Barrier Reef. I would like to thank honourable members for their constructive contributions to this debate. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 and to indicate Labor's support for this bill. Labor knows how important it is to make sure our national security arrangements are kept up-to-date to keep Australians safe and protect the freedoms that make our society what it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over 12 month ago, the government announced a number of measures to enhance the support provided by the Australian Defence Forces for national counterterrorism arrangements. I note that the Department of Defence and the government have already implemented a number of initiatives to provide greater practical support for state and territory law enforcement agencies which include an enhanced counterterrorism liaison network, an enhanced program of specialist training activities, and streamlined police access to Defence facilities such as ranges. This bill, while implementing relatively minor administrative changes to the existing call-out powers, is part of the measures that were announced by the government back in 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Act 1903, as it currently stands, outlines two basic types of call-out orders: an order for the Australian Defence Force to be called out immediately, and a contingent call-out order whereby the Australian Defence Force can be called out if specified circumstances arise. This bill amends the Defence Act in a number of ways but mainly for four purposes: the first is to make it easier for states and territories to request ADF support; the second is to simplify, expand and clarify the ADF's powers; the third is to enhance the ADF's ability to respond to incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction or across jurisdictions; and the fourth is to allow for preauthorisation for the ADF to respond to threats on land and sea as well as in the air, typically used as part of measures during major events such as the G20 or the Commonwealth Games.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that, following implementation of these changes, the state and territory police forces will continue to be the first responders to terrorist incidents, and call-out of the Australian Defence Force for the protection of states and territories will only be able to be considered following a request by the state or territory. Call-out of the ADF for the protection of Commonwealth interests may be initiated by the Commonwealth itself or requested by a state or territory. To this end, the explanatory memorandum outlines four principles that underpin the proposed changes in this bill. The four principles are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the ADF should only be called out to assist the civilian authorities</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if the ADF is called out, the civilian power remains paramount, but ADF members remain under military command</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if the ADF is called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances, and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That gives the broad rationale for this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now intend to go through in more detail the specifics of the four general or main purposes of this bill, which I will outline further. The first makes it easier for states and territories to request ADF support. Currently, The Defence Act prevents the Australian Defence Force from being called out until such time as the state or territory:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence; …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of that provision is to say that a state or territory would need to have exhausted its law enforcement resources before it would be in a position to request the assistance of the Australian Defence Force. The amendments in this bill provide a more flexible and responsive threshold that requires the ministers of the Commonwealth to consider, firstly, the nature of the violence or threat and, secondly, whether the calling out of the Australian Defence Force would be likely to enhance the ability of the state or territory to respond to the threat. That's a much more flexible basis upon which a state can make a request. The effect of the new provisions will be to allow greater flexibility for the ADF to provide the most rapid, effective and appropriate specialist support in responding to terrorist incidents, while at the same time respecting the position of the states and territories as the first responders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of simplifying, expanding and clarifying the ADF's powers in incidents of this kind, the bill does this in respect of the existing search and seizure powers when the ADF is operating under a call-out order. Currently, the Australian Defence Force search powers in specified areas focus predominantly on 'dangerous things' and do not authorise them for search for or detain people. The effect of this amendment is that ADF personnel will be authorised to search for and seize items, and search for and detain people, that are likely to pose a threat to a person's life, health or safety or to public health or safety generally. This ensures that ADF personnel operating under a call-out order, in collaboration with state and territory police officers, who will be leading the response to a particular incident, have search and seizure powers that complement and assist the state and territory law enforcement powers. However, the amendments will also ensure that Australian Defence Force personnel can only detain a person whom it is necessary as a matter of urgency to detain. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that where the police are also present, for example, it would not generally be necessary as a matter of urgency for the ADF to detain a person in that circumstance. Again, this highlights the fact that state and territory police forces will be the lead in respect of responding to these incidents, and the ADF are there very much for the provision of support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third issue is the pre-authorisation of the ADF to respond to threats on land and sea as well as in the air. Pre-authorised or contingent call-out will allow ministers to pre-authorise the Australian Defence Force to respond if specific circumstances arise. Currently, contingent call-out is limited to the protection of Commonwealth interests from air threats alone. This kind of contingent call-out order has been regularly made as part of security measures to protect major Commonwealth events such as the G20, the ASEAN summit and the Commonwealth Games. This is done now only in respect of air threats, for that is the limit of the contingent call-out power. This bill will extend contingent call-out to be available for the protection of both Commonwealth interests and state and territory interests from threats in the land, air and maritime domains. This reflects a greater conception of what a possible terrorist incident may be. The purpose of this amendment is to remove potential delays in seeking ministerial authorisation for ADF support once a threat is considered imminent or immediately after the event occurs. It will also provide additional support options in planning for major events such as the ASEAN special summit or the G20. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for greater enabling of a multijurisdictional call-out. It enhances the ability of the ADF to respond to multiple incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction, as well as to incidents which cross jurisdictional boundaries, including incidents which may occur in Australian waters and in respect of assets that are offshore. Again, this imagines, or has a greater conception in its underpinning, the potential of what a terrorist incident might look like. We have seen incidents around the world which are coordinated but occur in more than one place at the same time. So this seeks to reflect how a response might be made were that to occur in our country in more than one jurisdiction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill also contains a number of provisions in support of those amendments which I have outlined above. These include an increase in the requirements for the ADF to consult with state and territory police where it's operating within their jurisdictions, as well as adding the Minister for Home Affairs as a named alternative authorising minister in cases of an expedited call-out, which occurs when the otherwise stated ministers in the chain of responsibility are not present to provide that authorisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee conducted an inquiry into the bill. The committee tabled its report on 3 September and recommended the bill be passed by the parliament. However, the committee also recommended that the government give consideration to providing clear definitions of specified circumstances in the legislation itself or in the explanatory memorandum. I acknowledge that the government accepted the committee's recommendation and I thank the minister for tabling an amended explanatory memorandum just now which provides further explanation of the term 'specified circumstances' in the context of the contingent call-out powers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I outlined above, a contingent call-out order is one where the Commonwealth pre-authorises the Australian Defence Force to be called out if specified circumstances arise. The revised explanatory memorandum now states: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not intended that contingent call out orders under proposed section 34 will be made on the basis of vague or indefinite specified circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The specified circumstances must be sufficiently particular to allow authorising ministers to make the assessment required in order to satisfy themselves that the domestic violence or threat in the offshore area is likely and that the call-out of the ADF would resolve the incident. By way of example, the explanatory memorandum now states: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, a contingent call out order could be made to protect Commonwealth interests during a major international summit. Commonwealth interests requiring protection in these circumstances could include Commonwealth property, and visiting dignitaries or heads of state. A foreseeable risk may be a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attack at the summit venue. Accordingly, it would be appropriate for a contingent call out order to be in place to deal with this foreseeable risk, empowering the ADF to use its specialist capabilities should the specified circumstances of an imminent or actual CBRN attack at the summit arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In those words, I quoted from the explanatory memorandum itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum has also been amended to provide greater clarity on the meaning of 'Commonwealth interests', which includes Commonwealth property or facilities, Commonwealth public officials, visiting foreign dignitaries or heads of state, and major national events such as the Commonwealth Games or the G20. It has also been amended to provide greater clarity on the meaning of 'domestic violence' as conduct that is marked by great physical force and would include a terrorist attack, hostage situation and widespread or significant violence. It is perhaps worth understanding that this is a legal term of art deriving from a previous age and has a very different meaning from the way that term is used in current parlance. And it also has been amended to make it clear that the amended criteria that ministers will be required to consider in making a call-out order recognise that the calling out of the ADF to respond to an incident is a significant and exceptional act and is not to be done in relation to incidents that are within the ordinary capability of the police.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those comments, the opposition provides its support to this bill and notes that, as I said earlier, the Senate inquiry and the Senate committee unanimously recommended that this bill pass the parliament, with a request for additional explanation to be provided through the explanatory memorandum, which has been done this morning. We appreciate that. Given all of that, it is a piece in the further evolution of making sure that all our agencies in Australia are coordinated as well as possible to deal with the kinds of incidents which, unfortunately, are a fact of our contemporary life.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I certainly support the government's Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018, in front of us today. As you would understand, Deputy Speaker Bird, and the members in the House know, the world today is a very different place from that which existed in 1903, when this type of legislation was formed. The threats we face today are, unfortunately, greater and far more complex than those of many years ago and even in 1903.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, this bill makes it easier for the state and territory governments to request ADF support in circumstances of a terrorist attack. These amendments complement the practical measures already being rolled out by our government to enhance the ADF's support for national counterterrorism arrangements. As we all know and as we've seen all too regularly both overseas and in Australia, acts of terrorism are hugely challenging. Think of the truck attack in Nice, the attacks in London, the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney, the hijacking of a commercial airliner or a mass casualty or mass hostage event. When incidents such as these happen, local police are put under an enormous pressure, and they respond and react very, very well, but often long and drawn-out or multiple-perpetrator and multiple-location attacks require perhaps additional and specific responses. Under our Constitution, the circumstances where the Commonwealth, through the Australian Defence Force, could step in were very, very limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I started to say, they date back to 1903 and were set out in the Defence Act. Laws were tweaked somewhat in 2000, prior to the Sydney Olympics, to ensure that the New South Wales police had sufficient federal support to provide what was described, as we all know, as the best Olympics ever. Unfortunately, as we're aware, the world keeps changing—certainly since the end of 2000. We all remember the events in 2001; we've all experienced the impact they've had around the world not just in air travel but in airport security, security in public transport and security even here in Parliament House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been said before, the government's first duty—any government's first duty—is to protect its citizens. We have a very proud and enviable record with national security and with supporting our men and women in uniform, and that includes our Defence Force people as well as our people in our local and state police. It's about supporting troops here or overseas, and even our local police. Those of us who live and work in regional areas see the extraordinary work done by our local police with our own families in our own communities. I acknowledge and thank them for what they do every single day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the details of this bill: the bill implements the recommendations of the review of Defence support to domestic counterterrorism arrangements. That was announced by the Prime Minister in July 2017. The government initiated the review in response to the changing nature of the threat, demonstrated by the attacks around the world. We've seen so many of those. The key factor in launching the review was actually the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney, which was one of the most significant terrorist incidents in Australia's history. The resultant inquiries, including the coronial inquest, found, among other things, that the option to call out the ADF in support of the New South Wales police was considered but rejected due to the complexity of the process and the criteria involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to change those criteria. The government is keen to ensure that states can determine when to call on the ADF to assist in a way that is rapid, effective, predictable and transparent and, ultimately, where it would be beneficial to a potential situation. The changes in this bill remove the threshold requirement that says the state:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… would not be, or is unlikely to be, able to protect the Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes will also require that, in deciding whether to call out the ADF, Commonwealth authorising ministers consider the nature of the violence and whether, specifically, ADF support would be likely to enhance the state or territory's ability to protect itself or the Commonwealth's interests. It's a key issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Police and other emergency services are, and will remain, our first responders in this country. It is the immediate responses and actions of these first responders that can, and often do, have the greatest impact in terms of saving lives, protecting people and neutralising any threats. Each state and territory police force has specifically trained personnel who have expert capabilities to respond to terrorist attacks—hopefully not on Australian soil, but, as we know, we have to be prepared for whatever may befall us. We have to be prepared for what may be ahead, and there may be times when state and territory police actually need additional support to respond in the most effective manner. I see some young people in the gallery today listening to this. All of us in this chamber desperately hope that there is not a major terrorist incident in Australia that affects any of you. The reason we make the laws in this place is to protect young people and people of all ages just like yourselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Australian Defence Force's primary counterterrorism role is offshore, the ADF has the personnel, resources, specialist skills and assets that can assist our emergency services to respond in the event of a terrorist attack. The support can include capabilities such as tactical assault forces and any form of response and recovery that's required. For this reason, it's really essential that the defence forces are actually able and enabled to contribute effectively to our domestic counterterrorism efforts in every environment. In all honesty, we do not know what's ahead. We are aware of some of the threats and risks, but some are yet to unfold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of key underlying principles that inform the operation of the amended call-out provisions. The ADF should only be called out to assist civilian authorities. If the ADF is called out, civilian authorities will remain paramount, but the ADF members remain under military command. And, when called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in all of the circumstances, and they remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These factors do not limit the range of matters that authorising ministers can take into account. The amendments here will allow states and territories to request that the Commonwealth call out the ADF in a broader range of circumstances, making the process what we need, which is more flexible and responsible to the needs of states and territories, whilst at the same time recognising and respecting the different requirements of each state and territory. Importantly, the amendments do not mean that the ADF will be called out to respond to every threat; however, they will be given greater flexibility to respond to the wide range of threats that may arise—and we hope they don't arise, but we have to be prepared for them—and the range of response capabilities of every jurisdiction. It will also give responding state or territory authorities more flexible options to deal with an incident. They will make the call.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent terrorist attacks in cities like Paris and London have also prompted a reassessment of the scope of the ability to preauthorise call-outs of the ADF. It's known traditionally as the contingent call-out, which allows Commonwealth ministers to preauthorise the ADF to respond if specific circumstances arrive. This removes any potential delay, which is so critical. Time is critical in these situations. We've repeatedly seen how important time and timing is. It also removes any potential delay in seeking ministerial authorisation to act once an incident is actually taking place, and it enables the ADF to already be on the scene and ready to assist the police response. Contingent call-out is presently limited to only aviation and the protection of Commonwealth interests. From the passage of this bill, these amendments will extend contingent call-out to be available to protect state and territory interests, whether they are on the land, in the air or in the maritime domain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of the current threat environment, where terrorist incidents can be over in a matter of minutes, these amendments provide additional options when planning for and dealing with anticipated terrorist threats. It is the case that terrorist threats can be highly mobile and can occur in multiple locations simultaneously. That is what we are dealing with. It's more than conceivable that a threat may arise in one jurisdiction and rapidly move to another; therefore, it's critical that legislative arrangements do not hinder an ADF response in this context. These amendments will enhance the ability of the ADF to respond to incidents across state or territory borders by allowing for call-out orders to authorise the ADF to operate in multiple jurisdictions, as well as an offshore area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises the importance of the ADF working cooperatively alongside state and territory authorities by increasing the consultation requirements to work closely with first responders if called out. Under these amendments, the ADF will be required to consult with every state and territory affected by a call-out order to the extent possible in those circumstances. They also require that the ADF be utilised only in accordance with the written requests of the police force of the jurisdiction in which the ADF is operating—again clarifying the circumstances where the ADF is involved and limits on their involvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill further clarifies the powers of the ADF members that may be exercised by organising the powers into three distinct divisions. They will apply in both onshore and offshore areas to facilitate the ADF's ability to respond to multijurisdictional incidents and to streamline the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One important addition is the inclusion of the Minister for Home Affairs as a named alternative minister. Under the existing legislation, in an extraordinary emergency an expedited call-out can be made by the Prime Minister acting alone or, if the Prime Minister is unable to be contacted, the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General acting together. If only one of the authorising ministers can be contacted, an expedited call-out order can be made by either the Minister for Defence or the Attorney-General together with an alternative minister, including the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Treasurer. Following the reorganisation of the security agencies into the Home Affairs portfolio, the Minister for Home Affairs now plays a key role in counterterrorism coordination. He is a member of the National Security Committee of cabinet, with important security agencies falling within the Home Affairs portfolio. These amendments will add the Minister for Home Affairs as a named alternative minister for the purpose of expedited call-out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, can I say that it's a dreadful statement of fact that the world has changed. Many of us in this place are very concerned about what's ahead. It's changed significantly since 1903 and it's changed even more significantly since 2000. One of our important duties as a government—the most important duty—is to keep our citizens safe. The measures in this bill will ensure that Defence's specialist counterterrorism capabilities are readily available to states and territories if and when they are appropriate and needed. It will ensure the most rapid response possible, which is absolutely critical given the importance of timing and, equally, the current threat environment. The bill represents a huge improvement to the Commonwealth's ability to support national counterterrorism arrangements. While we in this place hope that they never need to be utilised, these changes, if they're needed, will help save Australians' lives in the event of a significant domestic terrorism threat. I commend the Attorney-General for his work and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak to the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 because it does address a lot of issues I've been concerned with over many decades. I see over there in the advisers' box a colleague of mine who has been at my side through a lot of these issues over the years—it's good to see you here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill comes at the intersection of critical issues that this parliament must deal with in terms of, as we heard, the safety of our citizens, but also the preservation of our essential democratic values and structures. So this is serious business. It also reflects the changing nature of the threats that our nation faces over the years and the need to remain agile and flexible in dealing with them and to give our agencies the ability to respond effectively. Obviously, the preservation of life is always at the forefront of that, but there's also the management framework within which force is applied in our democracy. In my own service, in places like Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq and Timor, and in the time I spent in Afghanistan, one thing that was very much brought home to me was that democracy is not so much about laws and instruments and elections but about a culture of democracy. So the signals we send when we take these measures are very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To reassure the public in understanding what's being attempted here, I want to put it within context. Our modern story of dealing with domestic terrorism threats began predominantly following the Hilton bombing in February 1978. That led to the death of three people, a police officer and two garbage collectors. Eleven people were injured. It was in the context of a regional Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. There were 12 heads of state staying at the Hilton at the time. It was really the first significant act of terrorism of that nature, but it came in the context of what had been building up through the sixties and seventies elsewhere in the world. There had been the development of organisations like Baader-Meinhof, or the Red Army, and Middle Eastern terrorism activities had grown in scope and nature around the world. So the bombing was something in the context of those things happening, when Australia had to wake up and say: we need to be ready to respond more effectively in these situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, Prime Minister Fraser called out the Army to secure the town of Bowral, where the further meetings for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting occurred. He did that as a direct Commonwealth interest call-out mechanism, which is distinct from responding to a state request for assistance. It did raise questions of how we were prepared, structured and legally provided for in dealing with the terrorist threats we may face. That led to the Hope royal commission which followed. The Hope royal commission canvassed a whole range of issues, including whether Australia needed a paramilitary force, a third force, to deal with terrorism and who should be responsible, whether it be police, military or a paramilitary force. At the end of the day, having duly considered this in detail, looking at experiences from the UK and elsewhere, the decision was made that we shouldn't go down the road of creating a third, paramilitary force and that the close-quarter-combat role should be handed off to the Army in dealing with hostage recovery or confrontations with heavily armed terrorists. That was the decision that was made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Special Air Service Regiment was handed that mission. My joining the Army was at the time of that actually taking place—the putting into effect of the raising of the black squadron, as they called it, the sabre squadron responsible for counterterrorism response within the SAS, and training and skilling it up to deal with those issues. That was the time I first entered the Army. Most of the early work I did in the operation space was in working with the regiment on building up its capacity, conducting exercises and working with state law enforcement authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It raised a whole range of issues. One of the things that hit me in the face straightaway was just how archaic the legal framework was for call-out of the Defence Force at the time. A lot of people may not appreciate this, but effectively the old model was built on an 18th century construct. The British Army was responsible for responding to acts of domestic violence; there were no police forces at the time. The framework within the legislation that we had involved the blowing of bugles, the reading of proclamations—which I'm not sure many terrorists would have been too impressed by—and the forming of troops into formations, possibly to conduct firing on crowds, et cetera. It was a terrible construct which didn't have a proper democratic framework around it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something really needed to be done. There'd been various attempts to try and do that, but people were always very sensitive to the ability to explain what had to be done and to create the right legal framework. Several stalled attempts followed, and various governments tried to move forward and failed. It was one of the things that I made a particular mission of mine to try and cure. We had the opportunity emerge in the context of the 2000 Olympics. I thought, 'This is it; if we don't use the 2000 Olympics to get this fixed, we may never get it done properly.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could also see the rise of growing and escalating threats moving into more dangerous spaces, such as weapons of mass destruction. That also informed how we approached the reform to the framework. In particular, we'd had the experience of the Aum Shinrikyo attack in Tokyo in 1995. Using the Tokyo subway, this extremist cult group used the sarin agent to attack the general population of Tokyo in several coordinated incidents within the Tokyo subway, and 5,500 people were severely injured or killed. The injured ran off in all different directions, approaching hospitals in Tokyo, spreading contamination as they went. This raised the spectre of having to contain events like this of a widespread nature. This event actually had a tie to Australia, in that Aum Shinrikyo had come to Perth in Australia to set up chemical-processing facilities. At the time they even looked at acquiring uranium deposits in Western Australia to facilitate the development of so-called dirty bombs or even nuclear devices because of the capabilities of some of the Aum Shinrikyo personnel. This informed how we would approach dealing with the reform of this framework in the lead-up to the Olympics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was difficult at the time. There was a lot of misinformation and, frankly, some reprehensible politics played by the Greens at the time. We took them through what we were attempting to do, and I think they were attempting to play politics around it, because they obviously could not see—or would not see—the threats that were coming down the pipe towards this nation. But, in the end, good common sense prevailed, because what we were doing was putting a proper democratic framework around this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was meant to deal with not only the problem of hostage recovery in stronghold situations but also recovery of vessels, protection of offshore platforms and containment of incidents of weapons of mass destruction. It would mean that we would be able to bring to bear all of the skills and assets that the Australian Defence Force had, which went way beyond what the civil infrastructure and assets were capable of. They included some very refined capabilities; some in technologies that I won't talk about. But obviously that close-quarters-combat role is something that the Australian Army is particularly adept at. There were also other capabilities, such as being able to have large-scale deployments of troops wearing nuclear, biological and chemical clothing and equipment to be able to do decontamination, to contain an area, to prevent what happened in Tokyo, for example. All of that informed what we did. We put boundaries around how we could set up controlled areas to provide for searching for dangerous items and authorising Defence personnel to do particular things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But all of this, and all of what's still at the heart of this legislation, is encapsulated around fundamental legal standards within this country. The same principles in the use of force apply to members of the Defence Force as apply to our civil law enforcement agencies. Underpinning all of that is the principle that members of the Defence Force, if called out in these situations, are still there at the request of civil authorities. The civil authorities have primacy, and Defence will only be used if it's necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is slightly expanding that concept to where we can look at particular skill sets and assets and capabilities that also might be better used. When I talk about new incidents and new issues emerging, a couple of our recent challenges that have informed these amendments include the Lindt Cafe siege and of course the rise of ISIS and its highly networked global operations using new methods of communication and encryption et cetera—more sophistication in that space—but there are also new styles of attack, which are there not necessarily to take hostages but to immediately cause casualties of any scale they can. So being rapid in your response and being able to deal with situations of hostage recovery or sieges is still a requirement, but there are also these other, wide-scale issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Lindt Cafe situation in particular brought home to me quite a few deficiencies in our response regime. Some of those are definitely in the public space now. There were issues around the communications insufficiencies in the New South Wales Police situation at the time. We had our TAG East team, who were doing constant rehearsals, who were there to be called on to resolve the siege. But we had a problem with the lack of numbers of personnel in New South Wales Police, so doing a rotation meant they were going to have to reach out to Queensland Police to do the backup rotation that was necessary, when we had TAG East sitting out there, doing their rehearsals, ready to go, in Sydney. The other component of that force structure of course was TAG West in Western Australia. TAG East in Sydney was ready to go, ready to deliver that assault, if called upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The standard of training is difficult in civil police forces; they are not often called upon to do a lot of actual operational activity, which is different from the 2nd Commando or SAS regiment which the TAG teams are based upon. So it is almost certain that the actual assault that had to take place in the end would not have resulted in the civilian casualties that we saw and would've been done more effectively. Also, our Sierra teams are more sophisticated in terms of sniper capabilities and have the ability to deal with certain other types of threat as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we create this flexibility for the situation where Defence assets are more appropriate to be used in a given situation or where you have a longer-term situation which needs a lot of redundancy built into it and you need the supplementary capacity that the Defence Force can provide. This is an important step forward in helping to deal with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw, obviously, a lot of lessons learned out of the Man Haron Monis situation. He came in as an asylum seeker under the Howard government and then the Howard government denied an extradition request from Iran and granted him citizenship. Then of course there was a failure of passage of information between the Attorney-General and the state authorities, and the state coalition government let him out on bail et cetera. There were a lot of issues that emerged out of that about passage of intelligence, communication and tracking and proper vetting of people in this country, which we've been dealing with on several levels through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and proposals that have been put before it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The essential nature of this legislation was also building on the experience we have with 9/11. There were changes made to the framework then because of the demonstration of those types of aerial mass casualty attacks as well. Already steps were taken at that time to facilitate the pre-emptive employment of air power to be on standby for major events like APEC meetings and heads of government meetings in our region, to provide that support across the region and in that Australian context to have that ability to respond quickly and effectively to deal with those kinds of air threats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The essential nature of the fine-tuning of this legislation, as we've heard, in dealing with multijurisdictional call-outs, is simplifying, expanding and clarifying the ADF's powers in these situations, particularly in relation to searching, so that it's no longer just confined to dangerous items but also extends to detain persons who pose a threat to life, public health or safety generally, and also to detain people in certain circumstances beyond what had previously been catered for. Giving more flexibility to the call-out regime, in terms of extra ministerial backup, was also a logical step to take. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Obviously this nation's going to continue to need to respond and react as circumstances change. The essence of this type of legislation and the processes which we engage in through the IS committee—I note the chair is here today, and he has personal experience of the sabre squadron I was referring to—this is a situation where we must continue to work together in a bipartisan way. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  It's my privilege to be in the House today to talk to the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. We understand very clearly that we, like every other nation, are in the firing line for a whole range of threats into the future. We always hope that these violent threats may not be inflicted upon the people of Australia, but we have to put this type of proactive provision into our legislation so that we can be prepared for whenever we are the subject of these terror threats. We also understand that if people want to get at Australians, they don't actually have to come to Australia. We saw that very much in the Bali bombings, where we had people inflicting great pain and loss of life on Australian people in a foreign country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are susceptible in many, many ways, and the ability for Australia to respond to specific events is quite difficult at the moment, when we have the primary responsibility as first responders being with our standard police forces from the respective jurisdictions. This legislation is now going to make it much easier, when an event does take place that is beyond the reach of our law enforcement agencies and they need that additional assistance, for them to be able to call out the ADF in a much more expedited manner to get the skill sets that they need. We know that the skill sets that are available within the Air Force, the Navy and the Army are the types of assets that we will need in the event that we have a future terror threat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will also make it very clear that in no way will the ADF be called in to disperse what we would call a peaceful protest. This has been an area of the legislation that's needed to be worked through from a legal point of view. People were looking at this legislation and discussing whether it was in any way going to impinge upon the freedoms and rights of people who wished to partake in a peaceful protest, and it has been set aside very clearly that in no way will that be affected into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this proactive legislation will give us the opportunity to make those call-outs. It's actually going to broaden the opportunity for different ministers. Currently, these types of powers rest solely with the Minister for Defence and also the Attorney-General, but the ministers who are now going to be able to make this call will also be alternative ministers. That's going to be the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Treasurer. It's going to make it slightly more flexible for government to be able to enact these call-out orders. I think the law enforcement agencies that will be asking for this assistance are very keen that the government that has to make these calls is going to have this greater flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the ADF understands that the powers it will be given will be at the request and at the instruction of the local police authority and include the ability to search those people who are at an incident and the ability to detain people who are at a particular incident. These are some of the areas where there has been some conjecture and certainly these are the actions that we have seen to be the most critical. But also, when it comes to some of the threats which we are yet to deal with on a large scale here in Australia, it might mean they will have the power to destroy certain assets that are deemed to be either a threat to the Australian people or, in fact, at the time inflicting loss of life on the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these are very serious measures that are being put into the parliament today. It's a very serious issue. We are trying to predict what may happen into the future and trying to predict what types of actions our Australian Defence Force personnel may be called on to assist with. At this stage, this is the way that we have been able to put the legislation together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also talking about not just a standard opportunity to call out the Defence Force. When there are extraordinary circumstances, we're going to have the ability to have expedited call-outs that are also going to be part of this legislation. In the event of a sudden or extraordinary emergency where it is not practical for the normal call-out to be made, the Prime Minister instead of the Governor-General can call out the ADF. In the event that the Prime Minister is not available, these expedited call-outs can be authorised by two other ministers: the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General. They can do that work jointly. In the event that the Prime Minister and one of the other authorising ministers are not available, an expedited call-out can be authorised by the remaining authorising minister—that is, the Minister for Defence or the Attorney-General, along with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs or the Treasurer. These expedited call-outs are designed to be used in response to a rapidly evolving, dynamic terror situation where an immediate response is critical to prevent the loss of life here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A contingent call-out is another aspect of this legislation, and part IIIAAA provides a mechanism to prospectively make a call-out order that will only come into effect if specified circumstances arise. The purpose of a contingent call-out is to preauthorise the ADF to respond to anticipated or foreseeable threats, should those circumstances arise. A contingent call-out authorises the ADF to respond immediately once the specified circumstances have arisen. A contingent call-out is currently limited to responding to air threats. The amendments will extend these contingent call-outs to be in relation to land and maritime threats, as well as to aviation threats, in the event of those incidents happening. The contingent call-out is the only type of call-out that has been used to date. These contingent call-out orders are made regularly as part of security measures to protect major Commonwealth events, such as the Commonwealth Games and the ASEAN summits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are putting this in place, hoping that we won't have to use it and hoping that, if we do use these provisions, they are used incredibly sparingly. We would also like to see the situation where our law-enforcement agencies are able to deal with most of these issues on their own. But, as was mentioned by the previous speaker, we have other areas, issues and events, such as the Lindt siege which took place in Sydney a few years ago. The subsequent reviews into the procedures that took place on that day suggested that that may have been an event where some ADF skills and personnel would have been able to come up with a better result, rather than the loss of life that we saw in that event. As was also put forward by the previous speaker, we know that there is always a raft of other circumstances behind many of these events that we see on the local news bulletins. Again, I would just like to acknowledge the incredible skills that we have available within the ADF—the most disciplined, humble and well-trained soldiers that we could possibly hope for. We understand how crucial they are for us in the work that they're doing, both here in Australia and overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a commonsense piece of legislation, where we are planning for the future. We understand that it's a future where we'll be living in very uncertain times, and we understand that in those uncertain times there will always be a threat where we may need this type of assistance. We always hope it doesn't happen, but the fact is that we have some of the best-trained soldiers and the best-trained troops in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This type of legislation is going to assist in keeping Australians safe. Every government that has the opportunity to govern this country should have as its first duty keeping Australians safe. This legislation is going to enable us to do that in a more proficient manner. It's going to create greater workability between our current law agencies and our ADF. It's also going to set out clearly the legal platform for what our ADF can and cannot do, to make sure there isn't confusion at the time of an event and to make sure that, in the days following the event, everybody knows exactly what they are supposed to be doing and what they are legally allowed to do.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  The Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 makes a number of changes to the existing legislative arrangements concerning the call-out of the Australian Defence Force in domestic circumstances by state and territory authorities. These changes are part of a broader set of changes already made by the Department of Defence and announced in July 2017 to improve the coordination between the ADF and the states and territories. These changes included an enhanced counterterrorism liaison network, an enhanced program of specialist training activities and streamlined police access to ADF training facilities. The catalyst for these changes was the coroner's report into the Lindt cafe siege of 2014, which discussed the failure of the New South Wales Police Force to make necessary requests for military assistance. The state coroner, Magistrate Michael Barnes, recommended in the report a fresh consideration of the criteria currently in the Defence Act 1903 that govern the circumstances in which state or territory police forces can request assistance from the military during an incident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today is a reaction to this recommendation but also to the broader set of threats that modern Australia now faces. This bill contains a number of measures. It amends the Defence Act to make it easier for states and territories to request ADF support; simplify and clarify the ADF's powers; enhance the ADF's ability to respond to incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction or across jurisdictions; and allow for preauthorisation for the ADF to respond to threats on land, at sea or in the air, typically used as part of measures during major events such as the G20 or the Commonwealth Games.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of principles that govern and constrain the new powers contained in this bill. The decision whether or not to call in the defence forces will remain entirely with the state and territory governments, but the threshold for them to do so is lowered. At present, defence forces may only be called in if the states are unable to handle any imminent threats themselves. The new amendments cast that threshold in a more positive light, with the new test being whether a call-out of the ADF will enhance the ability of the state and territory authorities to combat the threat. The bill also makes an obvious improvement that will mean that separate call-outs are no longer required for multijurisdictional incidents. In our current threat environment, it is easy to envisage a terrorist incident crossing borders. Imagine if an Army response unit had to stop at the border because they only had authorisation to be involved in one state. It doesn't make sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces a relatively new concept of a contingent call-out, allowing a single authorisation to be made that allows defence forces to, effectively, be on stand-by during major events. This power already exists for use in response to air threats and has, indeed, been used a number of times—for instance, during the G20 and the Commonwealth Games. Adding land and sea threats to this provision makes sense. Doing so would allow rapid response units to be ready to react in circumstances of elevated threat, allowing them agility that they currently lack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the changes in this bill are not minor. They are a significant shift in the relationship between our civilian enforcement agencies and our armed forces. That's why it's important to have appropriate safeguards. These safeguards include the following conditions: first, the ADF should only be called out to assist civilian authorities; second, if the ADF is called out, civilian authorities remain paramount, although ADF members remain under military command; third, when called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in all the circumstances; and, fourth, ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions. The bill maintains the requirement for an authorising minister to approve the request from a state or territory for ADF assistance. At present, the relevant ministers include the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes it is also important that the conditions under which the ADF can be called out are very clearly defined, so as to leave no room for ambiguity or misuse. That's why we're pleased that the government has responded to the recommendation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for a number of terms used in the legislation governing the circumstances in which call-out powers can be used to be more clearly defined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the explanatory memorandum of the bill is to be amended to define the term 'domestic violence', which has a meaning in this legislation that does not match with its commonly-understood modern meaning. It has importance in this context because it is a term used in the Constitution. In particular, it comes from section 119 of the Constitution, which reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see that the term is used there in a very 19th-century meaning to describe disorder and violence within a state. It's not being used in the sense in which the term is now understood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The term is referred to in this legislation as a necessary factor in a request for assistance from the ADF. The amended explanatory memorandum defines 'domestic violence' as 'conduct that is marked by great physical force' and would include a terrorist attack, a hostage situation and widespread or significant violence. The definition explicitly excludes peaceful protests, industrial action and civil disobedience. Needless to say, these are very important exclusions that clarify that these new powers will only be used in extreme circumstances and will not interfere with any regular civil society activities. In addition, we welcome the clarification made by the government in the explanatory memorandum about the threshold that needs to be cleared in order for ADF call-outs to be authorised by a minister. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This proposed threshold is not intended to impermissibly expand the circumstances in which the ADF might be called out, or result in the ADF being called out in response to minor incidents that police routinely and appropriately deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important reassurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes today will not, as I'm sure the Greens party would have you believe, result in the Army being called on to city streets to handle everyday protests or disturbances. We are talking about extraordinary circumstances that present a significant threat to life. In the unusual circumstances that a call-out does occur, once a request is made by a state or territory authority and approved by the relevant minister, the situation will still be in the control of the state and territory authorities, not the Army. The Army will only legally be allowed to use reasonable and necessary force where it assists civilian authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the additional clarifications provided by the government, Labor is satisfied this bill is a reasonable improvement on the existing arrangements governing the call-out of the defence forces to deal with extraordinary circumstances within Australia. We will be supporting this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  At its heart, this bill is about keeping all Australians safe. Now more than ever before, there are increasing threats to our domestic security. Terrorism is no longer contained abroad, and we know from credible intelligence that both individuals and groups have the capability and intent to carry out a terrorist attack on our home soil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's thanks to the great work of our talented police and security agencies that Australia has avoided a number of potentially deadly incidents. The very serious threat to an Etihad Airways flight out of Sydney just last year, caused by an improvised explosive device, and the subsequent investigation and arrests of suspects in raids across Sydney are a further chilling reminder of the necessity of this constant vigilance. As security threats cross borders and technology opens up new frontiers of terrorism, it's critical to have the right legislation that is both agile and responsive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 is reflective of our current security situation today. The previous legislation has not been updated since before the Sydney Olympics in 2000. In almost two decades, Australia has changed dramatically, and so too have our security challenges. The amendments which are put before the parliament today will strengthen our existing legislation. They will form a key part of our national security framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms are just one aspect of a series of new measures designed to respond to the complexities of contemporary terrorism. The central changes to the existing legislation relate to how the Australian Defence Force responds during the event of a domestic security incident. This bill will streamline the process for state and territory police to request help from the ADF. It means the ADF can respond more easily and quickly, ensuring that we are in the best possible position in the event of a terror attack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the ADF can only respond to a domestic security incident if state and territory police have exhausted their capability to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests. Under these new amendments, the threshold for a military call-out will be lowered, and the ADF can be mobilised to enhance and support police.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Defence Force is highly regarded as one of the best, if not the best, in the world. The combination of talented and determined sailors, soldiers, airmen and airwomen, along with our incredible technology and resources that this government is pouring into the ADF, are the backbone of our national security. Whether the enemy is here at home or tens of thousands of kilometres away across the globe, our service men and women are regularly in harm's way in the defence of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I travelled to Afghanistan with five other MPs to experience ADF life in the Middle East. During my time there, I lived side by side with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen. I attended their briefings and had the privilege of receiving intelligence briefings. That experience brought the security concerns our nation faces into stark focus for me. It showed me that people within the ADF are equipped with critically important skills. These include our Special Forces units and those with the knowledge and expertise to respond to a biological, radiological or nuclear disaster. It's this expertise that is vital and could one day prove life-saving in the event of a domestic security event. Specialist military personnel can be used to manage a prolonged siege such as the Lindt cafe siege. They could coordinate the response to a major terrorist incident stretching across several locations or utilise sophisticated weaponry to counter a chemical attack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple truth is that we do not know what sort of terror attack we could be confronted with, but what we do know is that we should use all the tools in our armoury to ensure that we protect this nation. We need the capabilities of the ADF to protect Australia from the land, the sea and the air. The ADF, as it often says, trains for the worst but hopes for the best, and it would seem incredible that we did not tap into that vein of experience and know-how. It's clear that the Defence Force is an important part of our national security policy, and these amendments highlight our government's commitment to legislative reform that protects our way of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's important that we recognise the work of our state and territory police officers. They, as our first responders, do great work in relation to security incidents. This legislation ensures that their role as the primary responders, the first responders, is protected, but it sets provisions to allow for increased consultation and collaboration with the ADF. In order for the ADF to be tasked, a request for assistance must be made by police and then approved by a senior government minister. In most cases, the ADF would not be required—for example, terrorist attacks involving a knife are typically over a short period of time, and the threat would not constitute or is unlikely to constitute an intervention involving the ADF. State and territory police will remain in control of such a situation, with the ADF offering any specialised support that the state and territory police may require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our police have a very special set of skills to respond to these sorts of incidents, and they are consistently evolving these processes to ensure that they are prepared in the event of such an event occurring. In the region surrounding my electorate of Fisher on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, local police have taken part in a first-of-its-kind training program, tackling the threat of terrorism head-on. The Security and Counter Terrorism Network training equips officers with the skills to assess possible risks, identify persons of interest and conduct threat assessments to prevent such an attack. The training further skills police in responding to and managing a terrorist attack or a major security incident. State and territory police will always remain our frontline defence and first responders in the immediate aftermath of any such incident, where routinely they would secure and preserve life as their principal and primary objects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the threat against our nation is, unfortunately, relentless. There are people and groups who wish to cause us devastation and harm. They wish to destroy our very way of life. A change in terrorist tactics means that we too need to change how our government responds. We've seen from the Borough Market attack in London and the Bataclan theatre attack in Paris that incidents can move very rapidly and fluidly. Again, our response needs to be rapid to prevent the senseless loss of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While attacks overseas can seem a world away, Australia is not immune to the potentially deadly threats. Our national terrorism threat today remains at 'probable'. Last year alone, there were 76 calls to the National Security Hotline every single day. That's around 27,000 in just one year. Australians reporting information and intelligence on national security and criminal activity have proven that they want to be active in the prevention of terrorism in this country. The phrase that was marketed by our respective governments was 'Be Alert, Not Alarmed'; the Australian people have taken that on board and want to be part of a proactive community to ensure that they do their bit in helping to keep us safe. But those 27,000 calls to the National Security Hotline in a year are a sobering statistic. Combined with the intelligence gathered by our security forces, they highlight the need to make these very amendments that we are debating today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes to our critical defence legislation should not be taken lightly. The amendments proposed in this bill are grounded in the recommendations from the Prime Minister's defence counterterrorism review. Significant consultation has also taken place with each state and territory as part of the development process for this legislation, and that is only fitting when we are looking to amend the way in which the ADF can be called out. Greater collaboration between our Defence Force, our security agencies and authorities is critical so that Australians can be kept safe and secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to this legislation come at a critical time and are an important step forward in how we protect Australia from a range of national security threats. Now is not the time for continued talk. Now is the time to act to ensure that our ADF are able to become involved in these sorts of incidents, if and when they are requested by state and territory police. They have the equipment, the knowledge and the expertise in personnel to be able to provide a greater degree of security to our country, and it would be absolute madness if we did not call upon those skills. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. I will say up-front that Labor supports this bill. Labor knows how important it is to make sure that our national security arrangements are kept up to date and that we always keep Australians safe and protect the freedoms that make our society what it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very significant piece of legislation, so I'm going to unpick some of the processes. For many people, the idea of the military being called out on our streets could be of concern. I just want to reassure people about the process. Obviously, in any legislative process there is the original idea, which can come from anywhere—from government, opposition or the public. Then in the Commonwealth parliament we need to look at the Constitution to make sure there is a head of power to support that idea being turned into legislation. Then there is drafting. We rely on parliamentary counsel for that. Then there is the crafting of that legislation through the political process of committees having a look at the proposed legislation. Then there is the debating process through the parliament after the committees have looked at it. Then it becomes law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention that to take us back to section 114 of the Constitution. When the colonies came together, most of those colonies already had a military force. Section 114 of the Constitution, which they agreed to send off to the British parliament, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution goes on to say in section 119: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right from the word go, our founding fathers—I have to say that, as it was largely a male show at the time—understood that the colonies would be giving up some of their powers over the military. In fact, section 69 says under the heading 'Transfer of certain departments':</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On a date or dates to be proclaimed by the Governor-General after the establishment of the Commonwealth the following departments of the public service in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the departments is 'naval and military defence'—obviously there was no Air Force back in the late 1890s when they were drafting this. And who will be the commander? Section 68 of the Constitution says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is clearly a head of power and a contemplation. From that, we draft some legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over 12 months ago the government announced a number of measures to enhance the support provided by the ADF for these national counterterrorism arrangements. The ADF are incredibly skilled personnel when it comes to looking after the Australian people. But obviously we need to take things in balance. If we are going to let the military come onto the streets—as a Queenslander, I know that the ADF often come out in times of trouble when natural disasters happen. This is a different use of the ADF. The Department of Defence has already implemented a number of initiatives to provide greater practical support for state and territory law enforcement agencies—not just cleaning up after a cyclone or flood, which the ADF have done so well so often. This is different. This is about an enhanced counterterrorism liaison network, an enhanced program of specialist training activities and streamlined police access to Defence facilities—for example, ranges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, while implementing relatively minor administrative changes to the existing call-out powers, is a key part of the measures announced in 2017. The Defence Act 1903, as it currently stands, outlines two types of call-out orders: an order for the ADF to be called out immediately—not something that happens very often, obviously; I think there might have been some coal strikes back in the forties during which that occurred—and a more common contingent call-out order whereby the ADF can be called out if specified circumstances arise. This bill amends the Defence Act to make it easier for states and territories to request ADF support; to simplify, expand and clarify the ADF's powers; and to enhance the ADF's ability to respond to incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction or across jurisdictions. We saw how in the United States during 9/11 it was across different states that the terrorism incidents occurred. It will also allow for the pre-authorisation of the ADF to respond to threats on land, at sea and in the air—typically for a big event like the G20 or the Commonwealth Games, recently held on the Gold Coast, as we saw.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that, following the implementation of these changes, the state police forces and the territory police forces will continue to be the first responders. I want to make sure people understand that. Even during a terrorist incident it would still be the state and territory police who were the first responders, and then, following a request by the state or territory, the ADF would be able to go in. Obviously, there is still a capacity for the ADF to be called out to protect Commonwealth interests or if requested by a state or territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum points out four underlying principles:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the ADF should only be called out to assist civilian authorities</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if the ADF is called out, the civilian power remains paramount, but ADF members remain under military command—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">which is something for the lawyers to understand. Further:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if the ADF is called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and I'll come to that in a second. Lastly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember that the ADF, in fact, have a higher system of accountability than normal citizens have because of the military justice system. If a politician falls asleep at work they might get an embarrassing photograph taken of them, whereas if a member of the ADF falls asleep while doing their job they can be in serious trouble. Obviously, if they fall asleep on their watch there is a different set of standards. There is a responsibility for them to act with honour and according to a military code that is above and beyond what most of us would experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's legitimate, important and responsible for any government to make sure it's looking after the populace and protecting them from any acts of significant violence, and that's obviously a legitimate purpose for this piece of legislation. But I'm going to take you, Deputy Speaker, to the balancing act we need to do. If we're going to ask the ADF to have these powers, it's important that we make sure the powers are not so broad. We have existing powers for the ADF to step up, and we needed the Attorney-General to explain why the existing powers are insufficient to protect Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was seen through the prism of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and also the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which had an inquiry into this piece of legislation. I'm thinking of those freedoms that we're all so keen to protect. We have the right to life, the right to liberty, the right to be free from arbitrary detention, the right to privacy, the right to have freedom of movement around the nation, the rights of freedom of expression, association and assembly. All of those things were looked at by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I'm the deputy chair. We looked at this legislation in report 8 of 2018, and we asked the Attorney-General to provide a statement of compatibility to show why these rights are being influenced by this piece of legislation. It is serious, because if there was a terrorist incident or something, if we had ADF personnel out on the street, the ADF don't have the same expertise as the police force when it comes to arresting somebody. A military engagement is completely different to the engagement of the police service in dealing with crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The powers in the legislation would permit lethal force to be used, even if a person was attempting to escape or flee, if the ADF believed on reasonable grounds that a person could not be apprehended in any other way. We need to ask the Attorney-General to make sure that such a power will be used properly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at what the legislation provides for. Currently the Defence Act prevents the ADF from being called out until such time as the states and territories 'are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence'. So, basically, when the resources of the state or territory have been exhausted, the ADF resources could then be called in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment provides a more flexible and responsive threshold that requires the ministers of the Commonwealth to consider the nature of the violence or threat. The example given by the previous speaker was that a person with a knife would not necessarily require the ADF to be called out, but a group of people acting in a concerted way might be enough to bring the ADF out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing the ministers need to consider is whether calling out the ADF would be likely to enhance the state or territory's ability to respond to the threat, keeping in mind—for the sake of those listening—that it will always be the states and territories who will be the first responders. There are also some amendments to ensure that ADF personnel can only detain a person when it is necessary as a matter of urgency. The explanatory memorandum makes clear that where the police are also present, it would not generally be necessary, as a matter of urgency, for the ADF to detain a person. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sensible part of this legislation is, particularly, the idea of a pre-authorised or contingent call-out. As I said, examples would be the G20, the ASEAN summit or the Commonwealth Games where there is already a process to ensure that the ADF is ready just in case anything happens. The other point to make is that the bill also contains a number of provisions that increase the requirements for the ADF to consult with state and territory police, where it is operating in their jurisdictions. I note particularly that the Minister for Home Affairs is named as an alternative authorising minister for an expedited call-out. One would hope that, before calling out the ADF, the Minister for Home Affairs would use good, calm, sensible judgement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this legislation was considered by the Human Rights Committee and also by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The Human Rights Committee looked at it through the prism of the human rights that I went through, but the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee made a couple of recommendations in terms of the need to provide clear definitions of what the specified circumstances might be—and the minister tabled an amended explanatory memorandum detailing some of those specified circumstances. The EM now outlines:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not intended that contingent call out orders … will be made on the basis of vague or indefinite specified circumstances. The specified circumstances must be sufficiently particular to allow authorising Ministers to make the assessments required …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to keep that separation clear for most normal circumstances. However, an obvious example would be if there were to be a major international summit and we had to protect some visiting dignitaries or heads of state. We would have to consider the possibility—or there would be a foreseeable risk—of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack at the summit venue. That would be an appropriate circumstance for a contingent call-out order to be in place to deal with something that would be a foreseeable risk and empower the ADF to use its specialist capabilities, should the specified circumstances of an imminent or actual chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack at the summit arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has also amended the explanatory memorandum to provide greater clarity on the meaning of Commonwealth interest and also the meaning of domestic violence as in:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… conduct that is marked by great physical force and would include a terrorist attack, hostage situation, and widespread or significant violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Labor Party is supporting this legislation, and so will I.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I rise to speak in support of Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. This is a very important bill and it was triggered by the Lindt Cafe siege of December 2014 and of course the coroner's report, which was released in May of last year. It's timely and important for a number of reasons. The first is that it implements recommendations from the Review of Defence Support to National Counter-Terrorism Arrangements, but, secondly, it optimises the legislative arrangements for calling out the ADF in the event of a terrorist incident. It gives decision-makers in government, authorised ministers—the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the defence minister and the Minister for Home Affairs—in extraordinary circumstances, the flexibility they need to keep the Australian people safe. That's the bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, in my view, it unlocks the high-end counterterrorism capabilities that reside in the ADF, specifically within Special Operations Command—and I'm speaking of Tactical Assault Group-West, the Special Air Service Regiment in Perth; and Tactical Assault Group-East, the 2nd Commando Regiment in Sydney. Both of those units are our premier counterterrorism force elements, and I'm very pleased to see this legislation pave the way for their use in the event of a significant terrorist event that affects Commonwealth interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, both these force elements serve at a reduced notice to move. They're always prepared for a terrorist event. They're constantly training for a number of contingencies. They benchmark against Five Eyes special operations and law enforcement units, so they have world's best practice at their fingertips. They also have significant combat experience acquired through ADF operations in Afghanistan over the past decade or so. They remain ready to resolve the most dangerous, complex and violent scenarios on behalf of the Australian people. Their training facilities are world-class. They use live ammunition almost every day—in fact, some have regular blood tests for lead, given the amount of time they spend shooting with live ammunition. My point is: nowhere else in government is anyone so equipped to deal with a terrorist scenario or incident involving hostages and people who are seeking to kill and do harm to Australian people in our Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question at the heart of this bill is: why the amendment? Since 2000, terrorist incidents and attacks have been increasing worldwide. Deaths caused by terrorism since 2000 have increased ninefold. In fact, in 2016, 29,000 people had their lives taken worldwide by acts of terrorism. If we look historically over the past two decades, we think of 9/11, Bali, 7/7 and now Paris and London. Sadly, the names of those cities are synonymous with terror attacks over the last five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2014, as I discussed, we had the Lindt Cafe siege in Sydney, which took place over two days, 14 and 15 December. The terrorist Man Haron Monis held 18 hostages in the heart of Sydney's CBD, and this was broadcast live across the world. I recall being overseas at the time and it being run regularly on international channels, which goes to a point I'll make later about the nature of international terrorism. This incident was eventually resolved by New South Wales Police, and tragically Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson lost their lives in the final moments of the siege. Man Monis—it's up for debate, but I judge people by their actions—claimed to be acting on behalf of ISIS. He requested a flag, and that's good enough for me. My view is that he was acting on behalf of a transnational terrorist organisation committed to undermining Western democracy, the rule of law and our way of life for the persecution of minorities and the disgraceful treatment of women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to go into the intimate details of the police siege here; that is covered in the coroner's report released in May last year. Many people—constituents and people in the media—across the country have asked the question: why weren't ADF counterterrorism elements used to resolve the Lindt Cafe siege incident? In short, this legislation will make it easier in the future for states and territories to request ADF support for those sorts of incidents and also for the Commonwealth to set in motion the use of those force elements if authorised ministers are convinced that the Commonwealth of Australia is indeed under threat. It's my personal view, in the event of the Lindt Cafe siege, that the threshold was met and the ADF would have been far better equipped, trained and more experienced to resolve that situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes it easier—among many things, but this is probably the most important point—for states and territories to request ADF support by removing the threshold requirement that the states and territories 'are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence'. The EM goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, authorising Ministers will need to take into account the nature of the violence and whether the ADF would be likely to enhance the state and territory response when deciding whether the ADF should be called out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to subsection 33 of the bill, which details the conditions for making the order. I'll go through it very briefly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really, really important point. We've seen the impact of global terrorism and the fear and the chaos that it manages to produce when coupled with social media and media. We've seen it in Paris, and we saw it in London just last year. The Lindt Cafe siege was a good example at home of how terrorists can use propaganda to their advantage. The Lindt Cafe siege was broadcast live across the world to people in many countries. It was very clear that the Commonwealth of Australia was under attack from someone claiming to be a representative of ISIS. In my view, the threshold was met. That's why it's very important that we send a strong message to these people who would attack our citizens and seek to undermine our way of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a robust response in the event of a terrorist incident. Last year the Australian Federal Police Commissioner said that most terrorist incidents are over within 10 to 15 minutes. This was true of the London attacks last year. Our state and our Federal Police will always be the first responders. They need the right training, equipment and legal authorities, including provisions for the use of lethal force, to deal with the evolving threat posed by radical Islamist terrorists specifically. The Lindt Cafe siege coroner's report released last year did raise some troubling points about the readiness of New South Wales Police to deal with a terrorist incident that involved multiple hostages held captive in a stronghold that, to be frank, wasn't overly complex. There were two entry points, I think, and we had the blueprints. A mock-up, I understand, was built at Holsworthy in preparation for an assault. I want to say that the New South Wales Police acted bravely on that night, and it's easy to make judgements in hindsight, but we shouldn't shrink from seeking to learn from this. I think the stakes are very high in these sorts of incidents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm very glad that the coalition government has reviewed ADF call-out arrangements in the event of a future terrorist incident. I've argued for some time that we should consider using the ADF counterterrorism elements drawn from those two units—the 2nd Commando Regiment and the SASR—if we have a prolonged terrorist incident involving a listed terrorist organisation, a proscribed terrorist organisation, holding Australians hostage. There are a number of reasons for that. First, an attack on the Australian people by a listed terrorist organisation is not a state criminal matter; it's a Commonwealth matter. It's an attack on the Commonwealth of Australia, so it's in our national interest—and I would argue that our reputation is at stake as well—to deal with these threats. The majority of these people who commit these terrorist attacks on behalf of Islamic State clearly don't want to negotiate. In my view, nor should we. The most lethal means of statecraft reside with the Commonwealth, specifically the counterterrorism units within the ADF. Terrorists who attack and kill Australian people need to be killed quickly to protect our citizens and to deny them a propaganda victory. We saw how quickly social media and the worldwide media broadcast the Lindt cafe siege, particularly when the New South Wales police made entry and resolved the situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally on this point, our ADF counterterrorism elements are world class. They train especially for these sorts of situations over and again, not just for strongholds like the Lindt cafe siege but also for aeroplanes, offshore environments, ships. There's nowhere else in the Australian government where people are equipped and trained and experienced enough to handle these sorts of complex situations. They are surgical in the application of lethal force. Culturally—this is a key point between our police and military—they're ruthlessly mission focused, particularly when it comes to resolving these sorts of situations. I mentioned the combat experience that is resident in both of those units.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also makes a number of amendments which will improve the operational and tactical effectiveness of ADF units. I'll go through them very briefly. It enhances the ability of the ADF to respond to cross-jurisdictional incidents by allowing a Commonwealth-interest order to authorise action in multiple jurisdictions so we can have multiple ADF elements deployed across the country, including offshore areas. It expands the contingent call-out to allow the ADF to be pre-authorised to respond to land and maritime threats in addition to aviation threats. That means our decision cycles are just that little bit quicker. We can get people out, stage them and be more prepared for contingencies, which is really important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation increases the requirements for the ADF to consult with state and territory police where it is operating in their jurisdictions. We know that state and federal police will always be first responders, so we need to have those linkages at the lowest tactical levels with the ADF. Having them train together and liaise regularly together will mean that, when a moment of crisis comes, we'll have a more seamless operation launched against terrorists who seek to undermine the Commonwealth of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation simplifies, expands and clarifies the powers of the ADF to search, seize and control movement during an incident. I won't go into the details here, but that's very important, obviously. It removes the distinctions between general security areas and designated areas to reduce complexity and uncertainty. Again, amendments that have tactical effect are very important for a seamless operation, especially in the midst of chaos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it very clear, because I know some of the colleagues opposite made this point, that at no point does this legislation undermine the principle of civilian control of the ADF. That remains unchanged, and it's upheld at all points through this amendment. That's a really important thing. Civilian control of the military is what marks us out as a Western democracy. I want to make that very clear. Moreover, ADF units, when deployed in response or called out to a terrorist incident, are still operating under the Australian rule of law. No obligations are lifted for them to accord with what is expected of them in the ADF and within our judicial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this legislation. I think it really does make our options for resolving these situations in the future much greater. It gives flexibility to our decision-makers, and, of course, at the end of the day, when we have a terrorist attack we want our best people on the ground resolving the situation. This legislation makes that possible. I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I rise today in support of the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. Many of us don't think about our first responders unless there is an incident that draws our attention on the news—or, increasingly these days, on social media. Every day someone in our community needs the assistance of the police or emergency services, including firefighters and our ambulance officers. On rare occasions this will also include our defence forces, and that's ostensibly what this bill is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make it easier for our state and territory governments to request the assistance of our Army, our Navy and/or our Air Force under certain circumstances. Labor knows and very much understands how important it is to make that sure our national security arrangements are kept up to date, to keep all Australians safe and to protect the magnificent freedoms that we have here in our country under our great democratic principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Act 1903, as it currently stands, outlines two types of call-out orders: an order for the ADF to be called out immediately and a contingent call-out order, whereby the ADF can be called out if specific circumstances arise. But the world as we know it, including Australia, is a very different place to what the lawmakers of 1903 experienced, and we have to respond today as modern lawmakers for the new demands of security in our world. Fortunately, Australia has had little experience of terrorism on domestic soil compared to the rest of the world. That is a great thing, and it's testimony, first and foremost, to our democratic rule of law. It's also testimony to the spirit of the Australian people, and I think it's testimony to the fact that here in Australia we have a very rigorous set of laws. As the previous speaker mentioned, we all operate under the Australian rule of law. That includes our police forces and our Defence Force, and that is still one of the great tenets of living on the Australian continent: that we all live by the laws that we make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the diligence of our security services, we can feel safe when we need to go to the supermarket or to the football or to some of those important events. Also, when we have lawmakers from other parts of the world visit our country, we want to know that they will be secure. But we can't ignore things like the Lindt cafe siege, as has been mentioned by many speakers already in this place this morning, or other incidents in tourist havens like Bali, where Australians have been impacted. This bill will ensure that local authorities will continue to be the first responders, but it also ensures that help is at hand if it's needed—and, importantly, that the help is at hand without delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to point out that the wonderful workers and local authorities will remain as the first responders in the case of a local terrorism incident. Ostensibly, the police, the firies and the ambos—the first responders in their chain of command—will still have control of the situation, but they will be able to request the assistance of the Australian Defence Force more easily if it's required. Under the existing legislation, states and territories can only call on the military when they are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests against domestic violence. I might just add that the context of the words 'domestic violence' is very different in how we use it today in modern language. It isn't in terms of family violence on that scale but is 'domestic violence' in terms of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July 2017 the government announced a number of measures to enhance the support provided by the Australian Defence Force for national counterterrorism arrangements. The Department of Defence has already implemented a number of these initiatives to provide greater practical support for state and territory law enforcement agencies, and these include things like enhanced counterterrorism liaison networks, an enhanced program of specialist training activities and streamlining of police access to Defence facilities. I actually think this is a really important part of this bill. We know that we have within the ADF some of the world's best practice in terms of training. We know that technology is constantly changing and we know that the ADF have access to some of the cutting-edge technology the world over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is really imperative that we allow our local authorities to train with the ADF, to have access to some of the new technologies and to really have the best KPIs in the world in terms of training. It really does make a lot of sense to extend to police, ambos and our other local authorities the training that the Defence Force has to offer. Why not use that incredible capability and capacity for training people? We train people extraordinarily well within the Australian Defence Force. Why not extend that and assist our local authorities? I'm told that the program is working particularly well. So I do think that it is a good development and a good trend to think our local authorities will benefit from that training from the Australian Defence Force. Indeed, the cross-pollination of experience that local authorities have to share with the Australian Defence Force as well should not be underestimated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of those measures announced in 2017 and amends the Defence Act to make it easier for states and territories to request ADF support and simplifies, expands and clarifies the ADF's powers. I think that's a good thing for the ADF. It enhances the ADF's ability to respond to incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction or across jurisdictions and allows for pre-authorisation for the ADF to respond to threats on land, at sea and in the air. This is typically used as a measure during major events as speakers have spoken about this morning: things like the Commonwealth Games, the G20 and ASEAN meetings. Amendments to the bill ensure that requests for assistance are implemented efficiently and quickly. As we know, for some of the threats posed a particularly imminent response is required. 'Time is of the essence' has never been more important, as my friend and colleague the member for Eden-Monaro pointed out—in an excellent contribution to this debate, I might add. Things have changed since the 1800s, when bugle calls were put out and how the Defence Force may have responded to a threat was very different. These days we see threats coming in all manner of ways and often without notice, so timeliness is really very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment also makes it very clear that, domestically, the state and territory police forces will remain the first responders to terrorist incidents and call-out of the ADF will only be able to be considered following a request by a state or a territory. It is important to provide a more flexible and responsive threshold that requires the ministers to consider, firstly, the nature of the violence or the threat and, secondly, whether calling out the ADF would be likely to enhance the state or territory's ability to respond to that threat. I think that is really a useful thing to keep in mind in relation to this bill as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will allow greater flexibility for the ADF to provide the most rapid, effective and appropriate specialist support in responding to terrorist incidents, at the same time as respecting the states' and territories' positions and rights as the first responders. The ADF will have pre-authorisation to respond to threats on land, at sea and in the air, enabling the multijurisdictional call-out. As the law stands currently, that is only available to us in the air. Pre-authorised or contingent call-out will allow ministers to pre-authorise the ADF to respond if specific circumstances arise, and that speaks to timeliness as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enhances the ability of the ADF to respond to multiple incidents occurring in jurisdictions. We've seen internationally where simultaneous acts of terrorism have happened. I think this is another really important part of this bill. We can be agile and responsive across multiple jurisdictions. If something were to happen in a number of states simultaneously, we could have the ADF come to assist in that situation. I think that really is an important part of the nimbleness required in today's modern world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, contingent call-out is limited to the protection of Commonwealth interests from air threats, so including sea and land is indeed very important. This type of contingent call-out order has been made regularly as part of security measures. We want to participate in things like the ASEAN Summit, the Commonwealth Games and the G20—it is absolutely imperative and it is a point of pride that we, as a modern democracy, can bring world leaders to our country to help create the world order, in economic and other terms. We want people to know that they can come here and avail themselves of our excellent security and feel that business can be done in a safe way here in Australia and that we look out not only for our own community but for the world community at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will extend contingent call-out to be available for the protection of Commonwealth interests—land, sea and air. The purpose of this amendment is to remove potential delays in seeking ministerial authorisation for ADF support once a threat is considered imminent or immediately after the event occurs. It will also provide additional support options in planning for major events. That is where so much effort goes in. I am pleased to see that those additional support options have been included in the bill, because we know that the planning of things like the G20 and the ASEAN Summit can take many months and require specialised personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence Force capacity and expertise enhance the efforts of local emergency services. This is an important point when considering the context of the amendments in this bill. Under certain circumstances, Defence capabilities may be critical to contain an incident and protect lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my proudest moments since being elected was to spend a week living at RAAF Base Williamtown, in my electorate of Paterson. Aside from looking at all of the work that goes on at the base, which makes an enormous contribution to Australia's defence capability, it was incredible to meet the individuals who sign up to be part of our Australian Defence Force and to look at the impeccable training regimes they go through so that they are ready. To think that we will have those personnel at our disposal should the worst occur is something that gives me great comfort. I am very proud of them. I am pleased to know that, should they be required, our RAAF Base Williamtown personnel will be able to be involved and able to respond to the call of the states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The experience at RAAF Base Williamtown certainly gave me an insight into the lives of our service women and men and the great sacrifices they make to ensure our security. I want to thank all those who serve and work hard and put their lives at risk so that we can relax and enjoy this wonderful country that we call home. Thank you for making yourselves available not only to our country on a broader scale but also to our local authorities, should the need arise. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. Let me say from the outset that Labor supports this bill. There has been some work done to adjust the explanatory memorandum and other elements of the bill, which we are satisfied with. We on this side of the House know—and I think there is a degree of bipartisanship on this—how important it is to make sure our defence and national security arrangements are kept up to date and streamlined in order to keep Australians safe and defend our national interests, as well as the very important freedoms that we have fought so long to protect and that make our society what it is today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A fundamental principle of modern democratic states is that there should be civilian control over the military. Intimately linked to that is the principle that only in very limited circumstances should the defence forces of a state be called on to conduct domestic security operations. We've seen, throughout human history, what happens that when those principles—particularly the latter one—are breached. We saw, in the 20th century, the manner in which fascism, tyranny and totalitarianism, both from the far right and the far left, were able to march across most of Europe. We saw the manner in which defence forces were used to conduct domestic operations against a country's own population. That's something that we never want to see again anywhere, but particularly in our modern democratic states. That's why this principle of ensuring the call-out of defence forces to assist domestic security services is very well regulated and delineated, in a very important manner, to ensure that no abuse can occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, we've seen a lot of work done on this bill. The government in July last year announced a number of measures to enhance the support provided to the ADF for national counterterrorism arrangements. The Department of Defence has already implemented a number of initiatives to provide greater practical support for the state and territory law enforcement agencies. These include an enhanced counterterrorism liaison network, an enhanced program of specialist training activities and streamlined police access to Defence facilities such as ranges and so on. These are all important because, as I noted earlier, the threats that we face now in this transnational, globalised world cut across sovereignty and boundaries and the artificialness, in some senses, of boundaries. They don't respect those boundaries. There needs to be better streamlining between our defence forces in the way that they go about their business to defend the national interest externally. They also need to work much more closely with our law enforcement agencies, who do the vast bulk of our counterterrorism work, at least in the operational sense. There are also our intelligence and security agencies, which play a critically important role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is part of those measures that were first announced in 2017. The Defence Act is a pretty old act, but it has withstood the test of time. It outlines call-out powers in three separate sections—somewhat repetitively, it should be said. But essentially there are two types of call-out orders under the original act: an order for the ADF to be called out immediately and what is called a contingent call-out order, whereby the ADF can be called out if specified circumstances arise. Under the current provisions in the Defence Act, the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence have key roles as authorising ministers. Where they are satisfied that the criteria for call-out have been met, they advise the Governor-General, who may make an order to call out the ADF on that basis. In a sudden or extraordinary emergency, where it is not practical to make a normal call-out order, the Prime Minister alone does have the power to call out the ADF through that process with the GG. Where the Prime Minister is unavailable, expedited call-out can be authorised by the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General jointly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 contains four amendments that adjust these provisions, making changes to them that are aimed at streamlining the legal procedures for the call-out of the ADF and enhancing the ability of the ADF to support state and territory police in responding to incidents of what is called 'domestic violence', including terrorism. The first amendment is designed to make it easier for states and territories to request that ADF support. Currently, as I said, the Defence Act prevents the ADF from being called out until such time as the states and territories 'are not, or are unlikely to be, able to protect themselves or Commonwealth interests against domestic violence'. The amendments that are before us provide a more flexible and responsive threshold that requires the ministers to consider (1) the nature of the violence or threat and (2) whether calling out the ADF would be likely to enhance the state or territory's ability to respond to that threat—going from the negative filtering of the decision-making process to a more positive aspect. This amendment will, and is designed to, allow greater flexibility for the ADF to provide the most rapid, effective and appropriate specialist support in responding to terrorist incidents while at the same time respecting the state and territories' position as first responders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment in the bill simplifies, expands and clarifies some of the ADF's powers under the act. This means ADF personnel will be authorised to search for and seize items and search for and detain people that are likely to pose a threat to a person's life, health or safety or to public health or safety generally. Currently, the search powers of the ADF are in specified areas. They focus predominantly on what's called in the act 'dangerous things' and do not authorise them to search and detain as part of their duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third amendment in the bill will enable multijurisdictional call out. Basically, the ADF will be able to respond to multiple incidents occurring in more than one jurisdiction, as well as to incidents which cross jurisdictional boundaries, including offshore on the seas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the fourth amendment in the bill will allow pre-authorisation for the ADF to respond to threats on land, at sea and in the air. Pre-authorised, or contingent, call-out will allow ministers to pre-authorise the ADF to respond if specific circumstances arise. Currently, that contingent call-out is limited to the protection only of Commonwealth interests from air threats. This type of contingent call out has been used in the past quite regularly with respect to security measures to protect major Commonwealth events such as the G20, the ASEAN summit, the Commonwealth Games and so on, specifically from air threats. This is being expanded and will extend the contingent call-out to be available for the protection of both Commonwealth interests and state and territory interests from threats from the land, air and sea, not just from the air. The purpose of this amendment is to remove potential delays in seeking ministerial authorisation for ADF support once a threat is considered imminent or immediately after the event occurs. It will also provide additional support options in planning for major events such as the ASEAN Special Summit or the G20.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that despite these proposed changes the state and territory police forces will remain the first responders to terrorist incidents, and call-out of the ADF will only be able to be considered following a request by the state or territory. That's an important and fundamental element that remains and, I think, is an important point, in consideration of what I said earlier with respect to the limitations that must be placed on the defence forces when they are asked to assist a state or territory. The request has to come from the state or territory, whether it's immediate or pre-authorised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes are underpinned by four principles, which are in the explanatory memorandum. It's worthwhile going over them very quickly. They are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the ADF should only be called out to assist the civilian authorities</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if the ADF is called out, the civilian power remains paramount, but ADF members remain under military command</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if the ADF is called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">in all the circumstances before them and, lastly—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are all fundamentally important principles. These principles emanate from right at the top, in section 119 of our Constitution, which says that the Commonwealth must protect the country from invasion and, if asked by a state, 'against domestic violence'. We touched on that term a little earlier. The fundamental and primary responsibility of our defence forces is to protect our sovereignty, protect our national interest and defend us from external threats. As I said earlier, given the world we live in now and the almost opaque merging, if you like, of the manner in which external threats emanate and how they can become internal threats, this means that we have to adjust our legislative frameworks to ensure that the defence forces are able to work more effectively with our law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The domestic violence that the Constitution talks about is something that, way back then, it was considered appropriate that the states, as they were at that time, would ask for assistance with when they were in trouble. That's what has continued to this day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to emphasise that the state and territory police forces will always remain the first responders and any call-out of the defence forces will only be able to be considered following a request by that state or territory. Again, it is that principle of ensuring that the relevant state ministers and the Premier are the ones who make that request.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member for Pearce, the Attorney-General, when announcing these proposed changes, said that the Lindt Cafe siege showed that the current threshold for the use of the military internally or domestically was too inflexible and he believed that it was 'inconceivable' that a future government of Australia would misuse the call-out powers to send troops out onto Australia's streets. This is the image that we're all worried about: seeing our defence forces walking down the major streets of our cities and not being subject to our laws—being called out by government to perform various operational activities without any limitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would agree with the Attorney-General. I actually hope that his belief is correct—that it would be inconceivable to see a future Australian government use the defence forces in any way other than the proper way of assistance to the state or territory that needs them. I'm hopeful that his belief in that is a correct one and will be accurate. But belief is not enough. Frankly, good drafting and good laws are what are critical, and that's what is more important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth remembering, when we talk about this, that the government has a track record of telling us that there is a difference between the wording of its laws and how they will be implemented. Let's not forget the My Health Record debacle earlier this year, when it was put forward by the government that the police would not be able to access our My Health Record data without a search warrant, yet the legislation as originally drafted explicitly gave them that that power. It has since been taken away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also say, in the context of all of this: it's about putting limitations on the politicians—on the government. I have the utmost confidence in our ADF personnel and that they will carry out the work that they do in the most professional manner. In fact, I experienced and saw, firsthand, when I was working in Iraq, our ADF personnel using skills and professionalism in the work that they did. In fact, I and my colleague Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro, who is not here, worked on a defence aid to the civil authority for the new government of Iraq—largely on the same principles that we're debating here today. They were very, very important elements, particularly for a country which did not have a tradition of civilian control of the military, let alone limitations around the use of their military in domestic actions. In fact, they were abused mightily, to the detriment of the Iraqi people, for many, many decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note, too, that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee reported its inquiry on this bill on 3 September and recommended that the bill be passed and that the government give consideration to providing clear definitions of 'specified circumstances' in the legislation itself or in the explanatory memorandum. That has been done, and we acknowledge that the government has made those changes. On that basis, we provide our support, satisfied that the changes that needed to be made to improve this legislation have been made. I acknowledge the work that has been done by all on this, including those at Defence. On that basis, I provide my and Labor's support for the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  Labor supports the Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018. As the House has heard from previous speakers, it's important that our national security arrangements are kept up to date, to be ready to respond to possible threats—terrorism being one of those threats. We have seen, unfortunately, the terrible consequences of terrorism, both here and around the world. As the Attorney-General said when he gave his second reading speech on this bill, as a nation 'we must remain agile and flexible in the face of the evolving terrorist threat'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current call-out powers for the Australian Defence Force were enacted in 2000 in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics. In the time I've got remaining before this debate adjourns, I just want to acknowledge some of those members of our Defence Force who were involved in the joint task forces during the Sydney Olympics, before I go on, at a later stage, to make some commentary on the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember well those laws that were enacted around the 2000 Olympics and the implications of those laws. I was working at that time in Sydney as a special forces liaison officer with the joint task force. That involved working in the police operations centre. It was at the interface between the civilian authorities and first responders. Intelligence was being analysed and actions and strategies were being managed from that police operations centre. Importantly, the special forces element were busy keeping eyes and ears on the situation as it evolved around those very successful Olympic Games. There were a number of joint task forces working concurrently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The support that was given to the civil security apparatus around the Sydney Olympics was an absolute credit to the Australian Defence Force. It was known as Operation Gold and it employed, all up, 5,622 ADF personnel, including a lot of reservists. There were two joint task forces. Joint Task Force 112 provided a wide range of support, including transport and general security roles. There was uniformed service personnel providing those services. They were important. They may not have been doing the preparedness, or kicking in doors and taking out terrorists, but they were doing the important work on the street, where things can be picked up that can lead to the tracking of threats and the neutralisation of threats. Everyone who participated in Operation Gold played an essential role in keeping those Olympics safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time—not as public as the members of JTF 112—were those soldiers, primarily of the special forces, but others as well, commanded by Brigadier Phil McNamara, now retired, who I was working for at the time. I was with the 1st Commando Regiment, but I had the absolute privilege of watching the preparations and operations conducted by the 2nd SAS Squadron and the Black Hawk helicopter forces from 5th Aviation Regiment. Of course, 4RAR Commando were also in readiness as the response company. Together, the tactical assault group, TAG, was collectively known as JTF 643. It's difficult to explain how important the roles of that JTF played, because we saw it in the fact that it was a safe and secure Olympics. I just want to commend all the members of that JTF. When you see operators like that working together, they're highly trained, they've made lots of sacrifices—time away from family, blood, sweat and tears—preparing themselves for that moment when they're called on to enact that power in support of the civilian security agencies. It was a real privilege to be part of that joint task force and to see those consummate professionals at work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I just say that, to my mind, from the police special operations centre, the military and the civilian agencies such as the police and other intelligence services worked together incredibly well. I thought there was a deep level of respect from the ADF to the job that the civilian agencies were doing, and vice versa.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  The Australian Values Study, released this week, found that one-third of Australians think it is good to 'have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections'. Extraordinarily, over half of 30- to 34-year-olds also think this is a good thing. Now, on one level, I can sympathise. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has been terrible. Not only is it a running joke—eating raw onions, knighting princes, denying the law of mathematics and gratuitously insulting countries, seemingly at random, on a day-to-day basis—but it's also failed the big tests, the things that really matter over the long term: responding to the existential threat of climate change, properly funding our schools and hospitals and building a fairer economy in which all Australian workers can get a long-overdue pay rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the great part of Australian democracy is that I can say all of these things about those opposite, in this place, without being scared of being tortured or having my family disappeared. Australian voters can say things like this without the fear of that too, and together we can try to fix it—to change a government and to elect MPs who will do a better job. Over decades, hundreds of thousands of people have fled their countries of birth, choosing to make Australia their new home, because they understand firsthand just how precious Australian democracy is. I say to all Australians, particularly young Australians: be angry—there's lots to be angry about—but don't give up on democracy. Speak out, organise, enrol, vote and fight to make our democracy live up to its promise.</span>

This weekend I will be together with my family, celebrating a very special milestone birthday, the 80th birthday of my beautiful mum.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mum was born in Melbourne of migrant heritage to parents who struggled financially and with all that went with being a new migrant. She was the middle child of three and the only girl. Despite the fact that both Mum's brothers—one older and one younger—became doctors, Mum was denied an education to meet her dreams and aspirations to become a nurse. 'Never give up and always be financially independent,' was Mum's mantra. It was an inspiration to me and I'm sure to many other women. She worked throughout her life in an age where it was considered a status symbol for many women to not have to work. Mum has always valued and treasured the power of women's friendship and was always the one to ensure that we knew what was important in life: family, good health, happiness, love and respect for all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mum's focus on ensuring that my brother and I had exactly the same opportunities, despite all that historical context in her life, has inspired in me my focus on gender and cultural equality and always helping those in need. Mum, you are the greatest role model, an inspiration, and always will be. I love you with all my heart. Happy 80th birthday.</span>

For the women's team in particular, it's been a premiership-winning season. The Randwick FC women's team won the division 3 league, clinching the title on the last day of the competition. They also took out the ESFA women's trophy against UNSW and then completed the treble with an epic grand final win against Easts FC.</span>

For the all-conquering women's team, the major awards on the night went to Tanya Kennedy and Kelly Farrell, as well as recognition for coach Anthony Murray.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A big shout-out to the club's Purple Hearts program for footballers with a disability. The Purple Hearts junior and senior teams compete in football gala days throughout the year, where the emphasis is on fun, friendship and having a go on the field. During the presentation night, Max Williams gave a very moving speech, reflecting the power of sport to promote friendship, commitment and team spirit, and the great camaraderie of the Purple Hearts. I would also like to make special mention to Ben Folino for his efforts in coordinating both teams. Well done to Richard and his team and congratulations to Randwick FC. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In the parliament this week we've had three regional leadership programs visiting. The work these programs do in developing our future leaders across regions is vital work for the long-term national benefit. One of the leadership programs was the Gippsland Community Leadership Program, which covers my communities in McMillan. The other day I had the pleasure of meeting with the 30 bright and passionate participants. This program was established in 1996—I think I spoke to the first gathering of this regional program in Australia. </span>

That's up from 27,000 in 2013, a nearly nine-fold increase. I'm regularly contacted by people in my electorate, asking why their application to be a citizen of our great country—the country that they love and they want to serve—has been so delayed. People who want nothing more than to contribute to their adopted country, as citizens, are being kept waiting by this Liberal government, with no reasonable explanation.</span>

Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison have overseen a dramatic blowout in citizenship processing. We should welcome people who already live in this country and want to formalise their allegiance and love for our great nation, not deter them, not frustrate them, not push them away. I call on the new Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs to clean up the mess of his predecessor, the member for Aston, and do what's right, not just for the over 200,000 people waiting but for Australia, which benefits when good, hardworking people want to contribute to what makes this country great.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Fake news reports have already hijacked serious debate on religious liberty by falsely suggesting the Ruddock review recommended faith based schools be allowed to expel students and sack teachers for being gay. The truth is that they are already allowed to under existing law—law made by Labor. How many reports of instances of such expulsions or sackings have there been? None that I know of. The real issue is the ability of faith based institutions to teach, advocate, express and uphold their faith based values without government intervention or penalty. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We need to be able to continue teaching and shaping our community life according to our beliefs and values, and we need to be able to employ staff that uphold those beliefs. It is the Christian values and Christian ethos of Whitsunday Christian College that is a major point of difference with government schools. To compromise our beliefs and values would be to change the integrity of our College.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of years ago, Tasmanian Catholic Archbishop Julian Porteous was taken to the antidiscrimination tribunal for the horrendous crime of giving Catholic school students a booklet promoting the Catholic Church's teaching on marriage. This is exactly why religious liberty laws are needed. We must not erode the right of Christian schools and other faith based institutions to ensure that their employees, who act as ambassadors for those institutions, behave publicly in accord with the faith based values of those institutions, in the same way that government schools ensure teachers behave in accordance with moral and ethical codes— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But, unfortunately, what we've seen from a succession of governments—whether it be the Abbott, Turnbull or Morrison government—is a $30 million cut to Charles Darwin University. This is unfair to young Territorians. It puts them at a disadvantage when compared to young people in other parts of the country, in particular young Australians in some of the larger capitals, who I'm very happy for.

Osteoporosis is the fragile-bone disease that causes painful, debilitating and costly fractures, particularly on the hip and spine, and is something that affects a close member of my own family. Every year in Australia 165,000 fractures occur, often from just a minor bump or fall. This disease makes bones more brittle, leading to a higher risk of breaking a bone, and often leads to increased immobility and a loss of quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Australia has one of the world's poorest rates for identifying and treating osteoporosis, with 80 per cent of women who have had a broken bone and who would qualify for osteoporosis treatment being neither investigated nor diagnosed. There are 5.5 million Australians over 50 years of age with poor bone health. In my electorate of Dunkley alone, 68 per cent of people over 50 years of age have poor bone health.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Osteoporosis costs the Australian health system $1 billion in federal funds for non-fracture osteoporosis costs, and $2.1 billion in state funds for fractures associated with osteoporosis. The total direct cost of fractures due to poor bone health is expected to be $21.9 billion from 2012-22. I'm pleased that the Minister for Health, Minister Hunt, is continuing to take this issue very seriously and encouraging further federal investment in this issue. Let's work together to take action on osteoporosis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Landcare has achieved so much for our environment, and I salute all winners and the 65 finalists in the National Landcare Awards, announced last week. But I wish to make special mention of two particular groups from Mayo: the Hindmarsh Island Landcare Group, which was named the national coastal winner, and the Mount Compass Area School Swamp Ambassadors, who won the national Junior Landcare Team Award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have visited and seen the work of both these groups many times. In fact I spent World Environment Day on Hindmarsh Island, celebrating the planting of the group's half-millionth seedling since the start of the Murray Mouth restoration project. I've also visited the Mount Compass Area School Swamp Ambassadors, who are the custodians of the school's critically endangered Fleurieu swamp.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other worthy mentions include Peter Watton, the SA finalist for the Individual Landcarer Award, for his work in the Scott Creek Conversation Park; the Goolwa to Wellington LAP, the SA finalist for the Partnerships for Landcare Award; and Grace Bassett, a Mount Compass Area School student who was a finalist in the Young Landcare Leader Award. Go, Grace! I am so proud of you. Congratulations to all involved in Landcare. You do a great service to our nation.</span>

I'd just like to mention various recipients. Millicent McNeil was acknowledged for her amazing effort of over 30 years of work with Red Cross. John Dainton was acknowledged for his service to agriculture, specifically dealing with salinity, and his work as a GMW Water director. Professor Avni Sali OAM has made massive contributions nationally and internationally through his work in medicine. Bill Hunter OAM was posthumously awarded an achievers award, accepted by his daughter. He was the founder of WB Hunter Transport, an amazing company in Shepparton. Patricia Gibson OAM was the first woman in Victoria to be a municipal clerk and did that work for 32 years with the Shepparton council. She was also acknowledged for her work at the GV Hospice. Don Kilgour OAM was acknowledged for his commitment to local sport, media and politics, being a state member for the Nationals from 1992 to 1999. Carmel Johnson was acknowledged for her work as Shepparton's International Woman of the Year in 1988, and she is still heavily involved in the GV Hospice. Peg Curtis, a 95-year-old lady, was up there to receive her award for everything to do with women's sport. She is a life member at Shepparton's tennis club, netball club, golf club and— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Juliet Moody is the brains and beauty behind the Fearless Comedy Gala, a night of nights where comedians from across Australia donate their talent for a great cause. This year was the third Fearless Comedy Gala, which once again raised funds for the Domestic Violence Crisis Service in the ACT. I've been lucky enough to attend this event every year, and it just keeps getting bigger and better. This year's event took the 'Fearless' fundraising total to over $100,000 in just three years. This is an incredible effort.</span>

Our government is absolutely committed to ensuring quality health services all around the country, including in my electorate of Leichhardt. The coalition is able to invest this $175 million in new MRI licences because we have certainly managed the health budget and we're able to run this very strong economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An MRI licence will allow providers in my electorate, such as Cairns Radiology, to charge MRI services to Medicare. Cairns Radiology, very capably led by Robin Gordon, has done an amazing job in championing an MRI licence for our city. This means that all Medicare-eligible MRI scans done at Cairns Radiology will be bulk-billed, making health care in my electorate more accessible and affordable for all Cairns and Far North Queensland residents. In under two weeks, more than 375 people completed my survey in support of one of those 20 MRI licences being allocated to Cairns.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">MRIs are about saving lives and protecting lives. My electorate in Queensland includes one of our biggest cities, Cairns, so, in my eyes, an MRI licence is a no-brainer.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a proposal, backed by the Australian Medical Association, that will make it easier and quicker to get sick refugee children to treatment. It does not, as some have stated, give Peter Dutton increased power to override doctors' orders. It will make the advice of doctors the primary factor in determining whether a child is evacuated for treatment and increase accountability of the minister's actions. We want doctors on our independent medical panel to have urgent access to all the kids on Nauru. If they recommend medical transfers, that is exactly what should happen.</span>

It should never have come to this. These are children who, with their families, sought our protection. Their trauma, which we are now witnessing, is because of five years of the untenable policy of indefinite detention. We need to get help for sick kids, then resettle them safely. We, in this parliament, must now work together urgently to end the trauma inflicted on these children and their families.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  On Saturday, Wentworth residents choose who will represent them in this place. Like many people, I'd rather there wasn't a by-election. But there's a choice to be made about who is going to stand up and advance Australia's interests. Whether they can depends on their experience and their capacity to be able to bring people together. That's why I can think of no better future member for Wentworth than Dave Sharma. I first met Dave at the ambassador's residence in Tel Aviv. My first impression of him was the same as my impression of him today: what radiates through is his charm, his warmth and his easygoing nature. In addition to his stellar professional and public service, and incredible academic careers, he was unquestionably Australia's most effective ambassador to Israel, because he was able to connect people between business and government to advance Australia's interests. The choice for Wentworth voters this Saturday is not about the past, it's about Australia's future. This is not a time for protest candidates or those who can't work with others. It is a time for someone stable, considered and effective. That's why I support Dave Sharma. A vote for Dave Sharma is a vote for majority government. A vote for Dave Sharma is for a representative who will deliver for his community. A vote for Dave Sharma is a vote for a more successful Australia.</span>

Not to be outdone, the Nationals have begun leadership speculation, according to media reports this morning and according to some of the Nationals. We've just heard in this chamber from those opposite that what we need is people who are stable, considered and effective! Well, I think you should be talking to the Nationals rather than the people of Wentworth. We have a government yet to explain why Malcolm Turnbull is no longer Prime Minister. Yet we have their coalition partners not remembering why the member for New England is no longer Deputy Prime Minister. Well, everybody in here remembers why the member for New England is no longer the Deputy Prime Minister. And what has changed since that happened? Nothing has changed since that happened. I call on those opposite, please, to act in the interests of the country. Wearing the flag is no substitute for good governance. Get your coalition house in order. What we need, to quote the member for Goldstein, is stability, considered people and effective government.</span>

In 2002, Geoff Searl won the Pittwater Medal for service to the community—an entirely deserving recognition for all he has done in my electorate. Geoff's great passion for health, history and the environment has placed him at the forefront of many initiatives, most notably the Avalon Beach Historical Society. Geoff formed the historical society in September 1983 with the aim of collecting visual, literary and oral artefacts of the Avalon area. The society provides lectures to many community groups, hosts noble speakers at their general meetings, and conducts tours of historic homes and iconic monuments throughout the area. Since the society's formation, Geoff has also been responsible for the displaying of eight photographic exhibitions—a remarkable feat, given its relatively brief existence. Geoff has also contributed to the Mackellar community through his significant volunteer work. As a young man, Geoff was chief gear steward and chief instructor of the Avalon Beach Surf Life Saving Club. Years later, in 1998, he was inspired to begin patrolling once again, after writing the 75-year history of the surf club for its publication. About nine years ago, Geoff also formed the Angophora Bushcare Group, which takes up to 10 volunteers to look after Angophora Reserve on a weekly basis. I have one other thing to say: Dave Sharma deserves to be elected as the next member for Wentworth.</span>

After the member for Curtin's quixotic quest for the prime ministership failed, the coalition had to put in a new minister from WA, and they picked the member for Durack. How would you feel if you were those other members? The member for Durack was their best option—a woman who has quickly established that she's the worst environment minister in the history of the Commonwealth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She's even worse than the member for Flinders. She misjudged the Great Barrier Reef admin cost by $60 million. She insulted the former president of Kiribati, Mr Tong, by saying, 'It's always about the cash.' She ditched the knowledge of the 91 scientists who are members of the IPCC. She thought temperature was measured in per cent rather than degrees Celsius. And when she was asked about her climate change policy, she listed three policies: the Emissions Reduction Fund, which has run out of money, and the CEFC and ARENA, both of which this government has tried to abolish. What a slur on the great state of Western Australia that the government thought that she was the best option to represent that state in cabinet! The great tragedy is that the environment is what suffers. The environment is suffering because the member for Durack is incompetent and unfit to hold office. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Seven weeks of auditions led to four junior primary and four middle primary finalists performing, and they were amazing. I'd like to acknowledge comperes Caitlin and John and contestants Portia, Ava, Ruby, Lachlan, Aadhya, Lyla, Rosie, Olivia, Maddie, Zach, Emma, Madz, Keira, CC and Aryan and teacher John Osborne for putting on such a great show for the wonderful audience of students, teachers and families who cheered them all on. My co-judges, Principal Leanne Prior and specialist music/arts teacher Stephanie Hammond, and I had a really tough time choosing the winners. Congratulations to junior primary winner Lachlan Diercks and middle primary winner Zach Parish.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a lot of courage to speak in front of people, let alone sing or dance or perform. Paringa's Got Talent beautifully demonstrated Paringa's values of bravery, caring for others, taking on challenges and trusting one another. Students Ella Bruce, Jessica Martin, Olivia Charters and Aryan Alavi also demonstrated how caring and thoughtful the Paringa Park students are when I presented them with the Australian and Aboriginal flags. My visit to Paringa Park Primary School was one of the most special events that I have attended this year. I am so proud to have these wonderful teachers, students and families in my electorate. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  For eight hours today, our IT and email systems would not work. In any normal week, you wouldn't point your finger at the member for Fadden and say that he'd exceeded our entire parliamentary download capacity, but this has not been a normal week. On Monday, we had 23 government senators get up and walk across to the other side of the Senate chamber and vote in favour of a white pride motion. Not to be outdone, on Tuesday, we had the Prime Minister of Australia announce that he wants the people of Wentworth to believe that he's going to move Australia's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but he doesn't want anybody else in the world to believe that he means it. Later that night, we had the environment minister stumble into a restaurant in Canberra for the purpose of insulting the former Kiribati president, a potential Nobel laureate. On Wednesday, we had that same minister forced to explain why $80 million of the half-a-billion dollars granted to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation would be used for administrative purposes. That's a lot of photocopying! The National Party hate to be left out of a carnival. They thought that three days before a big by-election where the message is stability would be an excellent time to run a leadership contest. With all of this going on, you can't rule out the member for Fadden as the No. 1 suspect. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  One of the great unfinished road projects in central-western New South Wales is a decent road link between Orange and Mudgee across the Macquarie River at Dixons Long Point. Indeed, I often refer to it as the holy grail of unfinished road projects because people have been trying to get this link for 160 years. There have been many advocates for the crossing, including Sir Charles Cutler, the former member for Orange and Deputy Premier of New South Wales.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project would open up the region for tourism, for commerce and for better health services. It has a huge groundswell of support in the local community, and in recent times the New South Wales and Australian governments have committed funding for feasibility reports. A lot of work has gone into those reports, which have been overseen by Cabonne Council, and I have to say they look very positive. The preferred option, a bridge over the Macquarie River at Dixons Long Point along with paving of about 40 kilometres of road, would cost about $19.3 million. The benefit-cost ratio has come in at an impressive 2.491.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government recently announced the $3.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importance fund has opened, and this is all about providing better connections between regions and better access for tourism. I've already submitted the feasibility study for funding to the government, and our communities are very keen to snaffle funding for this road. It's time to get this project cracking.</span>

It doesn't happen often in this country. 103-year-old Ron Collings and 102-year-old Esther Collings from Goolwa, South Australia are celebrating their 80th wedding anniversary tomorrow. Let that sink in—80 years. This doesn't happen very often. Those who organised the congratulatory messages, as the Leader of the Opposition would know, say there have only been a handful of such anniversaries in the history of the country. So it is, I think, a very special moment for Australia. When Mr and Mrs Collings got married, Joe Lyons was the Prime Minister and John Curtin was the opposition leader. So they've seen a few since then.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, to the serious nature of what I'm talking about today: Ron and Esther met each other at the Ozone Enfield picture theatre when Ron was selling sweets. There must have been something wonderful in the water at Goolwa, because Ron kept his driver's licence until he was 100 years of age. Esther says the secret to a successful marriage is giving each other space to pursue your own interests, and it's about compromise as well. When asked what the anniversary means, Ron said, 'It means we've been married a very long time.'</span>

You've got to work at it to make marriages work. And we're all very grateful to our partners and our wives and husbands outside of this place who enable us to do this. But in Mr and Mrs Collings we have an inspiration to every married couple in this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, on behalf of the government and the country, I want them to have a very happy anniversary tomorrow. I know the member for Mayo is attending the celebration. I am sure she will convey the joy of this parliament. May God bless you both and may you have many more years of good health, love and happiness.</span>

All of us, as members of parliament, have the privilege of congratulating our senior constituents on their well-earned milestones. It is pleasant, actually, to take a moment to congratulate Ron and Esther Collings, two of Australia's more than 4,200 centenarians, as they celebrate the rare and remarkable feat of achieving their 80th wedding anniversary tomorrow. It means that they're now about two years or so away from the current Australian record.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As honourable members would know, traditionally anniversary gifts begin with paper for one year. They work their way up: silver for 25, ruby for 40, gold for 50, and so on. Apparently the traditional gift for the 80th anniversary is oak. Now, looking online, a lot of places recommend an oak photo frame, symbolising endurance and longevity. But, fair warning: nothing stands still. There is a new movement out there to change the 80th anniversary gift to 'a combination of diamonds and pearls'. Ron, if you're listening to this or watching this, I'm confident that Esther will be perfectly happy with a nice frame!</span>

Congratulations from all of us. Enjoy your afternoon tea tomorrow. Best wishes to you and all your family for the time ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:05</span>):  Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on indulgence on this very special moment. Like every member here, I have the great pleasure in writing congratulatory letters for 50th and 60th wedding anniversaries, and last year couple Jack and Fay Miller from Victor Harbor celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary. However, an 80th wedding anniversary is extremely special, and I'm looking forward to visiting Ron and Esther Collings from Goolwa tomorrow. Prime Minister, I very much look forward to taking with me the best wishes of the parliament for that special milestone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After meeting at the picture theatre, they married in 1938 at just 23 and 22 years of age respectively. The Depression was still being felt by many Australian communities. Esther was a dressmaker, and Ron a travelling salesman. Now Mr and Mrs Collings are Australia's oldest living married couple, and may I add that they are happily married. They've been blessed with three children, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What always strikes me when I talk to couples who have been together for decades and weathered the storms of life together is: what is your secret to making such a successful relationship? I'm told it's compromise and communication. Mr Collings loves his footy—regrettably, he loves the Sydney Swans and not the Adelaide Crows—while Mrs Collings prefers yoga. Both have given each other the space and time to support each other's own pursuits. I think they're a good example for all of us here in the parliament, and I know all of Mayo is very proud of them. So I congratulate Ron and Esther Collings on reaching their 80th wedding anniversary, and I look forward to sharing in their wonderful celebration tomorrow.</span>

Is he concerned about it being leaked from within the government, and why did the Prime Minister fail to initiate a full cabinet process to fully consider the serious implications of his proposal?</span>

There's no evidence of that. ASIO, as a matter of routine, provides this advice to Commonwealth and state governments on security matters, as it should. The director-general has advised me that he has spoken with the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and will formally refer this matter to the AFP for investigation. The government, of course, does not comment on the contents of security advice and intelligence matters. I want to repeat and reassure Australians that ASIO has no evidence at this time of any planned violence in response to the government's announcement on 16 October, and the matter was fully discussed by cabinet.</span>

He knows, like all members on this side of the House, that this place too often gets caught up in the Canberra bubble. It too often gets caught up in talking about rumours, gossip, confected outrage and conflict. This is why Australians switch off from listening to what happens in this place, while those who want to stay fixated on the Canberra bubble just stay in that bubble.</span>

Here's something that matters: unemployment has fallen to five per cent, the lowest level since April of 2012. Here's something that matters: 60,000 fewer people are unemployed today than at the last election. Here's something that matters: 2.3 per cent employment growth. That's up from 1.9 per cent at the last election and from 0.8 per cent when we took over running the Australian economy from the Labor Party. Here's another thing that matters—</span>

That's 150,000 more than were promised. We promised a million, and we've delivered 1.15 million. Why? Because we've been backing Australians in small and family businesses all around this country. And here's another thing that matters: in this parliament, because of the initiative of our government, small businesses and family businesses will be paying 25c tax in the dollar under the plan that we legislated this week.</span>

Our government is delivering—whether it's for small and family businesses or whether it's delivering the infrastructure that matters—and we are able to deliver because we're getting things done and we are focusing on making our economy strong. I'll tell you what a strong economy looks like: the unemployment rate at five per cent and jobs growth of 1.15 million over the last five years. When you can do that, you can pay for affordable medicines, you can pay for schools, you can pay for hospitals, you can support our veterans and you can support aged care with $1 billion extra every year in investment into aged care. Our government is not stuck in the Canberra bubble like the Leader of the Labor Party. We are stuck in getting on with the job of delivering for Australians. </span>

We believe in sticking up for country people. We do. We believe in helping to create jobs: more jobs, local jobs and jobs in country towns and regional cities. We believe there is a bright future ahead for country communities and regional areas, and we are working hard every day, in every way, to secure just that. That means investing in things that matter, whether it's in Flynn or wherever it is across this fantastic country. There are investments such as the construction of the new Blackwater Aquatic Centre, a $6.2 million investment; the Callide community hub, stage 1; and, of course, our $10 billion investment in building a better Bruce Highway—in Flynn, that means an investment from Midgee to Gingin.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are investments that build stronger country communities. They support people in the bush who need it, and they help make the regions an even better place to live, work, invest and raise a family. That's what we believe in and that's what we're delivering. We believe in small-business tax cuts—tax cuts for those hardworking small and medium family enterprises, of which there are 16,800 in the seat of Flynn. The member for Flynn is backing them every day. He's working hard to build a better future for them. Do you know why? Because they create jobs. They help us get the unemployment rate down to today's figure: five per cent. And that's helped create more than a million jobs over the past five years. But I ask: what do those opposite believe in? What to do they actually believe in? In life, you have to believe in something. You have to fight for something. What do those opposite believe in? What do they fight for? Is it better trade relations? No. They want to tear down the Trans-Pacific Partnership 11. Building a better Australia or conducting class warfare? They once stood up for workers—for shearers, coalminers, truckies, people who helped build the nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes the member for Maribyrnong talks a big game. Sometimes he thinks that rural communities deserve better roads. But that's not as important as actually funding it. Sometimes he thinks about jobs and opportunities. He talks about them for people in Blackwater, but that disappears when he's in Brunswick. He says one thing in one place and another thing in another place. What does he believe in? We don't know. We know that the member for Maribyrnong believes in unionists. We know he believes in union thugs who do not believe in the rule of law. He wants those people who break the law to make the law.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is at stake, I'm asked, under a Labor government? For regional people, that will mean that their regional funding programs disappear. Trade; strong borders; regional funding, including for mobile black spots; the $75 billion record amount of money we're spending on infrastructure across the nation: that is what is at risk if ever this man becomes Prime Minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:18</span>):  I have no such suspicions as are imputed by the member for Sydney. What I can tell the House, though, is that Minister Payne and her Indonesian counterpart had a constructive discussion on 16 October regarding Australia's announcement. I continue to remain in contact with President Widodo. Minister Payne emphasised that there had been no change to Australia's commitment to the Middle East peace process and to a durable and resilient two-state solution that allowed Israel and a future Palestine state to exist side by side within internationally recognised borders. We are aware of Indonesia's views on the Middle East peace process. They are entitled to their views, and we will discuss those views with them, as I am anticipating doing as we go through the summit season. I can discuss the views that I have articulated on behalf of our government, which is a position which is held by our government, by our members, by our cabinet and by our National Security Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is our view when it comes to the state of Israel. That is our view when it comes to the Iran nuclear deal. I don't know what the Labor Party's view is, Mr Speaker, because when I read what the member for Melbourne Ports said when he was asked in May of this year, 'Do you think the embassy should be moved to Jerusalem?' the member for Melbourne Ports said: 'It's where the Israeli capital is. It's where the Knesset is. It's where all of the ministries are. Provided it doesn't preclude further negotiations when the Palestinians come to their senses.' That's the view of the member for Melbourne Ports. I suspect the member for Wills has a very similar view. I know the member for Sydney thinks Israel is a rogue state, Mr Speaker.</span>

So we have a New South Wales Labor Party which is behaving in an anti-Semitic way, Mr Speaker, and they want to pretend to the Australian people that they're supporters of Israel. Really?

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, some months ago, you made a ruling where, in response to a question from our side, you said that, even though technically the language was not viewed as unparliamentary, you wanted to have a particular standard of debate in this parliament. An accusation of anti-Semitism is extraordinary, and there is a reason why the reaction you just saw from the opposition occurred. I ask that the Prime Minister withdraw.</span>

I think it's fair to say that this week there's been a degradation, and I'd say from both sides. I'm not sure the Manager of Opposition Business wants me to go into all of the 90-second statements and statements that have been made with respect to the Senate motion that's been a hot topic. But I think it would be very remiss of me and disingenuous of the Manager of Opposition Business to ignore where members of the government have been compared to the Ku Klux Klan, and I took no action. It is tough language, but it is a matter for the Prime Minister. I want the language on both sides to improve. The Prime Minister has concluded his answer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:25</span>):  I thank the member for Mackellar for his question. I know that he is working hard for the people of Avalon, for the people of Dee Why, for the people of Mona Vale—across his electorate—to support families, businesses, and retirees. The people of Mackellar, like people across this whole country, are benefiting from the actions of this government, helping to create a stronger Australian economy—a stronger Australian economy which has seen GDP real growth at 3.4 per cent through the year; a stronger economy which is seeing the budget come back to balance a year earlier than expected, in 2019-20; a stronger economy which has seen our AAA credit rating reaffirmed by the three leading credit-rating agencies; a stronger economy which has created more than one million new jobs; and a stronger economy which, today, saw the unemployment rate come down to five per cent. That is the result of a Liberal and National Party government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the benefit of a strong economy is that you can provide and fund the health services that the public need, you can put new drugs on the PBS, you can increase funding for schools and for tertiary education, and you can increase the support for those who need it most, like those needing disability support services. But you can also provide tax relief—tax relief, as the parliament of Australia did today, when it passed the Morrison government's tax cuts for three million small and medium sized enterprises. Today, we passed tax cuts through this parliament which will support businesses which employ around seven million Australians. If you are running a cafe, today—as a result of our legislation—we're putting an extra $2,500 in your pocket each and every year. If you are running an independent supermarket or a pub, as a result of our legislation that passed the Senate today, we're putting an extra $12,500 in your pocket each year. This is what Liberal and National Party governments do. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We reduce taxes, and we grow the economy. In contrast, those opposite have a five-point plan to increase your taxes—to increase your taxes on your income, to increase your taxes on your business, to increase your taxes on your savings, to increase your taxes on your property and to increase your taxes on your electricity bill. Only the Liberal Party and the National Party, in the Morrison government, can be counted on to grow the economy, to create more jobs and to reduce your tax bill.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:29</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, you and the Minister for Home Affairs misled parliament yesterday when it was claimed there are about 65 medical personnel on Nauru and that children are evacuated on their advice. The truth is there's only half that number at any time and medical advice is routinely overturned by Border Force. In fact, virtually all the children that have been evacuated were because of Federal Court orders or the threat of legal action. Prime Minister, will you correct the record, or will you continue to peddle lies about the abuse of the children suffering in Nauru? After all, the community expects politicians to lie but not to lie about children's lives.</span>

He said, 'Oh, come and meet my guest,' which I did do, and I was introduced to the former President of the Republic of Kiribati, President Tong, with whom we had a very pleasant, lighthearted conversation. I don't recall the complete conversation, but what I do know is that when I have looked at the letter from Senator Dodson, which describes the conversation, I know that is not the conversation.</span>

This has been confirmed yet again today with the latest release of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, revealing yet more record highs for Australian workers. Under this government, there continue to be more Australians in work than ever before. And, under this government, there are more people in full-time employment, which we have seen climb to a record high. And this is true for women in full-time employment—again at a record high under our government. We have seen unemployment drop to five per cent, the very best result that we have seen in six years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just good news on the job front. We've also been able to bring forward tax cuts for small, medium and family sized enterprises that will benefit more than three million small businesses across the country that employ more than seven million Australians. It helps the member in his electorate of Petrie. More than 12,000 small and family businesses in his electorate will be able to invest more in their businesses so that they can continue to create economic opportunity for their fellow Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked: are there any risks? I'm sad to inform the House that there are, and they are sitting opposite. Rather than backing small business to create more jobs, the Labor opposition would rather back militant unions like the CFMMEU, a union that only this morning was ordered by the Federal Court to pay more than $300,000 in fines for, amongst other things, threatening to smash small businesses and to smash contractors at Sydney worksites. In handing down this fine, the judge observed the CFMMEU—which, by the way, has received more than a million dollars worth of fines this year alone—as seeing these penalties as simply 'the cost of doing business'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What sort of response do you think this deserves? Does it deserve supporting the government's legislation in the Senate that would weed out these rogue elements in the union movement? We would like to see that, but those opposite would rather block it because they would rather stand not with small business but with militant union leaders—the people who are thugs and bullies and standover men who would smash contractors and subbies and small businesses right across the country, who would actually see the lawbreakers become the lawmakers. The Leader of the Opposition needs to stand up. He needs to be more like Bob Hawke, who stood up to the BLF. Why is he just a militant union marshmallow man?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had assumed the member for Watson's somewhat general question initially was asking how much of the $440 million grant—which is a lot of money for the reef, and I'm sure the member would agree—was able to be spent on administration and scaling-up activities. It is five per cent, which is correct. I think it's worthwhile reflecting a bit more broadly on this incredible record grant: up to $200 million for water quality; $57.8 million for crown-of-thorns starfish; up to $100 million for reef restoration and adaption science activities; up to $22.35 million for Indigenous and community reef protection activities; and up to $40 million for reef integrated monitoring and reporting activities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The total amount of the grant that may be spent on the foundation's administration work, which was what I thought was the question associated with the grant, is $22.5 million, or five per cent. In addition, the foundation may use an amount of interest that it earns on the grant towards administration costs, but this is capped. The maximum amount that the foundation may use for administration, including the interest component, is a total of $44.3 million. So, given the scale of the grant, I think this administration spend is reasonable.</span>

                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:41</span>):  I want to thank the member for Brisbane, who, before coming to this place, was a strong advocate for a strong economy through his work with small businesses and, since coming to this place, has built on that work with being a strong advocate for the listing of new medicines such as Orkambi, in which he took a deep, strong, personal interest. One of the things that he knows is that it is critical that we have a strong economy in order to list these new medicines because, if we don't, as we saw earlier, if fiscal circumstances did not permit, as was the case under a previous government, new medicines would be deferred. We've dealt with that risk at length this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I particularly want to focus on why the strong economy allows us to list these new medicines. In particular, today, we see an unemployment rate of five per cent and 1.1 million new jobs. That allows us to ensure that all of the new medicines that the medical experts recommend should be listed are listed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one in particular that I want to focus on because this brings us all to the point of why we are in this House—the very things that we seek to achieve. One of the topics that the Prime Minister helped bring to the parliament was spinal muscular atrophy. It's a cause that's been deep and close to him, and it's something about which he has been passionate. A new medicine that we were able to list earlier in the year was Spinraza. Spinraza, which is also known as nusinersen, is for spinal muscular atrophy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've received a letter which was conveyed to the member for Corangamite from a family in her electorate, the family of Stephanie Nave. I met with the parents, Amanda and Mark. They talked about what this medicine, which would have cost $370,000, has meant, since it was listed, for their beautiful little daughter Stephanie. As Amanda says: 'It has now been four months since she'—this is Stephanie—'and the first batch of SMA kids to be treated have started, and, for Stephanie at least, the results have been nothing short of amazing. At her physio visit seven days after the first treatment, she was not only able to sit in a preloved manual wheelchair that friends had given us, but she could push it, on carpet. Each and every day we see new things, and she is continuing to get stronger. She has more energy. She's become very chatty, and, because her lungs are stronger, with increased respiratory muscle strength, she's spending a lot of time singing. It is wonderful to finally have some optimism and return to a time when you are able to celebrate milestones and not simply watch skills vanish.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the story of listing new medicines. This is the reason we have a strong economy. This is why we deliver the new medicines, because, at the end of the day, whether it's Stephanie or other children, if we can save and protect their lives, then this parliament is doing its job.</span>

I must say that I am completely overwhelmed. I know that you find me endearing. I know that you miss me. I know that you want me back. I know that I'm the only reason you ever get a question. There is a whole range of other legislation that we need to get through, such as the small business tax cuts, which I know are vitally important. There is so much more that we have to get through. I know that we're looking forward to the $272 million, which we fought for, for the national Regional Growth Fund. I know there are so many people who want to know where that money is going to be spent. There is so much that this good coalition government is doing and there is so much in front of us, but I'm sure we will get to that motion. When we do—and I'll take it on notice—I'll get back to you personally. When we do, you might like to ask me another question. God knows I've got a bit of spare time up here.</span>

Following on from that spirit of bipartisanship, I know she would like—as I'm sure all members in this House would—to wish those who are doing their leaving exams, right across the nation, all the very best over the coming weeks, because it will be a very trying time for them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has an economic plan. It's seen more than one million jobs created. It's seen an unemployment rate of five per cent. It's seen economic growth at 3.4 per cent through the year, faster economic growth than any G7 country. It's seen the smallest budget deficit in a decade. We are on track to come back to balance a year earlier, in 2019-20, with a AAA credit rating from the three leading agencies. What does this have to do with education? Everything, because it means that Australians can rely on our government to deliver the essential services we all rely on, the essential services that mean that we can fund the education our kids need. What are we delivering? Record funding for state schools, record funding for Catholic schools and record funding for independent schools. Our government is providing a record $309.6 billion in recurrent funding to all Australian schools from 2018 to 2029, including $88.9 billion over the next four years, delivering for state schools, independent schools and Catholic schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not just focused on investment; we're focused on outcomes and, in particular, student outcomes. That's why we're working with the states and territories to deliver the National School Reform Agreement. This includes creating a unique student identifier that will give our kids, parents and teachers the ability to view lifelong progression in education so we can identify problems and opportunities and improve results. In addition, learning progressions will provide support for teachers to teach the curriculum in a way that best suits individual students. This means every child will get a year's worth of learning for every year in education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government believes that you can improve student outcomes without putting up taxes. Those opposite believe you have to do everything by putting up taxes—$200 billion worth of taxes. Australians know that, if you can manage the budget, you can deliver the essential services Australians rely on. This is what our government is doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any suggestions that the Bureau of Meteorology is reducing its commitment to any state or territory are absolutely false. The bureau has reassured the Australian community on numerous occasions over the last month that it is committed to maintaining its presence in all states and territories. The claims made by the Community and Public Sector Union that the bureau is cutting services are completely false.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Advances in technology mean that the bureau's routine forecasting can largely be done from a few specialised locations and with fewer resources. But this will allow the bureau to increase the capacity of its state and territory staff to work on more important services, like spending more money working with emergency services on the ground during cyclones and bushfires, which I'm sure the member for Solomon would welcome.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As some experts contacted by Fact Check suggested, rather than representing a cut, the decision to carve out $1.2 billion of "efficiencies" could rather be characterised as an attempt to better target aged care funding, with spending continuing to rise in real terms.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Professor John Wanna, an expert in public administration at the Australian National University's College of Arts and Social Sciences, said the reduction in the rate of increase in future spending should not be characterised as a "cut", because future spending was more anticipated than real or legislated.</span>

There's a start! A five per cent unemployment rate, down from the last election—down from when you were Treasurer and you left the books in a fiscal mess. The budget is coming back into balance in 2019-20. The AAA credit rating is retained—a AAA credit rating that that shadow Treasurer said couldn't weather tax cuts. We've legislated tax cuts and we've retained the AAA credit rating.</span>

He is someone who started up as an immigrant to this country and has become an ambassador for this country. He is someone who understands the issues in relation to the Middle East clearly better than anyone who sits on that side of the chamber. More importantly than that, he has a deep compassion and deep knowledge of how he can make a better life for those who live in his community.</span>

It has also ensured the government has been able to guarantee Medicare, guarantee affordable medicines, have record funding in schools and hospitals, and to pay for the NDIS—something that was a bipartisan vision of this chamber. I commend former Prime Minister Gillard for initiating that, but it is this side of the House that has been able to pay for it because we are committed to a strong economy that delivers.</span>

There is a choice on whether the government can continue to govern with its majority and continue to deliver the important economic leadership that is supporting 29,000 small businesses in Wentworth. Some 60,000 Wentworth residents will benefit from the tax cuts we legislated and which the Labor Party, if they ever get into the government benches, will cut in half. Labor will strip $70 billion out of our legislated income tax cuts. They will hit self-funded retirees and retirees more broadly, including pensioners, with a $5-billion-a-year retirees tax. Labor's $200 billion in higher taxes will suffocate the economy. Only by voting for Dave Sharma, the Liberal candidate for Wentworth, this weekend can Liberal voters and voters in Wentworth be guaranteed of the strong economic management which is supported by a majority Liberal-National government.</span>

As we have already heard, today we have in the gallery the winners of the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's Prizes for Science are a great opportunity for us to recognise not only the work of the prize winners but the work of Australian scientists. The room last night was full of scientists who have put a lifetime of work into their research areas and who are out there supporting the work that business needs, that the economy needs and that the government needs to make sure that we are growing and providing jobs for the future. As a government we are doing that by ensuring that we have a strong economy so that we can contribute the dollars that are needed to support research and infrastructure in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the coalition has built a strong economy, we have been in a very strong position to announce in the budget earlier this year a $2.4 billion commitment over 12 years to Australia's research, science and technology capabilities. This includes, importantly, $41 million to establish the Australian Space Agency, which will grow our space sector, which currently stands at about a $3.9 billion contribution to our economy, with about 10,000 workers employed in that sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the period up to 2030, the coalition are working to make sure that we build the Space Agency and we build the space sector so that space provides a $12 billion commitment to the Australian economy and up to 20,000 jobs. That is an outstanding contribution from science to the economy, and that is only able to be made because the coalition have been able to build our economy so strongly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, whilst we are focused on the economy, we are also focused on making sure that we are developing a pipeline of people who are going to be able to take up the jobs of the future. And, in so doing, we are injecting money into developing STEM capability in Australia for all Australians, and particularly for women in STEM. So we will, as a government, continue to build our capability in science, technology, engineering and maths so that our young people have every opportunity to go into rewarding and fulfilling jobs of the future.</span>

More than $50 million has been announced to support headspace and its expansion all around the country. That's what I've been up to. I've got no idea what this bubble-obsessed Leader of the Opposition is interested in.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I thank the member for Groom for his question and for his interest in this very important issue. I also thank him for hosting a recent visit I made to Toowoomba to meet with veterans and war widows in his community. In just a few days time the Invictus Games will be held in Sydney, where there will be some 500 athletes from 18 nations across the world gathering in what will be a great celebration of sport but, perhaps more importantly, a great celebration of service to one's country. We will be represented, obviously, by a very strong Australian team.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Defence Force, by any estimation, is a world-class Defence Force, but these are not supermen or superwomen. Sometimes they get injured. Sometimes they bleed. Bones are broken. And sometimes their minds need time to heal or the benefit of specialist assistance by mental health professionals. On behalf of a grateful nation, we have an obligation here in this place to make sure we do put our veterans first, that we do put our veterans' families first and support them at these times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no question that the Invictus Games and sport more generally can be a great and incredibly powerful part of the recovery journey. In this respect, we will use sport over the next 10 days to help the Australian Defence Force personnel, those wounded, ill and injured service men and women, supporting them in their rehabilitation and perhaps also generating greater understanding throughout our community and throughout the world about the role of our service men and women and also how we can work with them to make sure that, when they transition out of the Defence Force, they can go on to lead very productive lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was in Toowoomba, I had the pleasure of meeting Stephen Osborne and his wife Wendy-Leigh. I want to thank again the member for Groom for facilitating that meeting. He is quite an inspiration—the member for Groom is an inspiration, but so is Stephen. Stephen was medically discharged from the Army and took up archery as part of his way of rehabilitation as a way of improving his focus and improving his balance and coordination. It has worked miracles for both Stephen and his wife, Wendy-Leigh. He put himself forward to the games as something of a personal challenge, and his journey has been quite extraordinary. It's taken him out of his comfort zone. It's given him the chance to meet with other veterans who share some of his hardships and has allowed him to recover in ways he didn't think was possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout last week I also had the chance to meet with other members in Queensland along with RSLs. We bumped into quite a few Invictus athletes who were getting ready to come down to Sydney. To say they were excited is an understatement. To say they have the support of their communities is an understatement. We in this place simply need to support and unite them as they go through their journey in the next 10 days. There will also be opportunities in the Invictus Games for me to meet with international guests who host forums where we'll be exchanging ideas on how we can do more to support our veterans and their families in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventy-two great Australian athletes represented Australia once before in uniform in the Navy, the Army or the Air Force, and in the next 10 days they'll represent us on the sporting field, and we wish them well.</span>

In this very brief indulgence I would like to suggest to the parliament that we do more in this moment than just speak words, as important as they are. Previously, the Australian Sports Medal was awarded to people who contributed to the nation's sporting success. For example, 18,000 people received an Australian Sports Medal for their work on the Sydney Olympics. But the medal has since been discontinued. I offer Labor's support to reviving the Australian Sports Medal. It's within the power of the government of the day to write to the Governor-General and revive it. Given the wonderful spotlight that Invictus puts upon veterans, disability and the nation's sport, I think this would be a modest recognition for the actual team, the leadership team and the administrators.</span>

                </a>  During question time today, the Prime Minister made a reference to our side of politics, claiming that we were anti-Semitic. As someone who has spoken up against anti-Semitism and spoken up on behalf of mistreatment of Jews, particularly during various parts of the last century, that is a deeply offensive statement. I imagine that I am not the only person on this side who feels strongly about this and feels that the Prime Minister should do the right thing and withdraw that comment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  Before I call on the matter of public importance, I've got a statement to update members on an aspect of the security works, just for a minute or so. It's particularly to do with the security upgrade, which is the electronic access system. I'll provide the House with a more comprehensive update on the other aspects of security works next week.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As most members would be aware, in September 2014 a review of Australian Parliament House security arrangements was commissioned in response to the increased national terrorism-threat level in Australia. The review recommended a series of internal and external security enhancements at Australian Parliament House, of which many of the recommendations are progressively being implemented, and a number have been completed under the direction of the presiding officers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the recommendations from the 2014 review was for the parliament to implement an electronic access system. As members would have seen, the system has been progressively installed throughout members' suites over several months but not switched on. A trial of the system has been conducted in several offices, including my office and the offices of the Deputy Speaker, the Second Deputy Speaker, the Clerk, the Serjeant-at-Arms, the Chief Government Whip, the Opposition Whip and several members of the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. I've only had positive feedback during this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparation of a wider rollout of the system throughout the House, I've briefed both the House Standing Committee on Appropriations and Administration and the House Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. Both committees have endorsed the rollout of the system in the House of Representatives. The privileges committee has stipulated several conditions in relation to the rollout, which I've agreed to and I'm happy to talk to members about in due course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the endorsement of both the relevant House committees, the electronic access system to members' suites will now be switched on progressively over the next month or so. Parliament House passes for members and their staff will now become keys to the offices. Offices will be switched on corridor by corridor, but, of course, the Serjeant-at-Arms' office and the Department of Parliamentary Services will contact every office prior to this occurring to provide all of the relevant details and operating procedures. These staff will assist any members who do not yet have a Parliament House pass in obtaining one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, can I inform members that this electronic access system has been installed, switched on and operating in the ministerial wing for some months now. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I would like to begin by giving up a bit of my time to express support for the former defence minister for the initiative put forward by the Leader of the Opposition on the Invictus Games. I associate myself with the words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in support of those contesting the games. I wish them the very, very best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we gave the member for New England an opportunity to show his leadership right here in question time. Of course he grabbed the opportunity with both hands, unsurprisingly. But what people in the towns, large and small, in rural and regional Australia are asking themselves is: why doesn't the government give a toss about them? Why are the National Party, in particular, so focused on and so intensely debating their own political internals, while there are so many challenges to be dealt with in rural and regional Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said here many times before that, every time a government take the budget knife to funding in schools and education, hospitals and higher education, the pain is disproportionately felt in rural and regional Australia. When they cut funding to schools, rural schools feel it most. In fact, many of them become unviable. When they cut university funding, it hits regional universities hardest. When they cut hospital funding, regional hospitals feel it most. When they freeze the Medicare rebate, it's residents in rural and regional Australia who are affected most. When they cut vocational education and training, it's the rural TAFE facilities that come under threat the most. And, when you make a mess of the NBN, it's the people in rural and regional Australia who feel it most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Possibly the greatest betrayal by this government with respect to rural and regional residents in the last five years is its total inability and unwillingness to further progress drought policy reform. We are in the middle of one of the most severe, most protracted and hottest droughts probably now in our history, and this government has been caught asleep at the wheel. What will we get next Friday—tomorrow week? We're going to have a national drought summit, five years into the term of this hopeless government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now, five minutes or more to an election campaign, the National Party—that's not their real name; they're actually called The Nationals, but they have a bit of an identity crisis and universally call themselves the National Party—want to bring their chief wrecker back to the leadership of the party. They want to bring the member for New England back. This is the same bloke who has a one-dimensional approach to public policy. The word for that is 'chaos'—chaos and dysfunction. When the member for New England left the agricultural portfolio, I said in this place, 'Today the member for New England moves on, and today we start cleaning up the mess.' It will take a long, long time—in fact, it won't be entirely cleaned up until we have elected a Shorten Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when the country was crying out for leadership and unity, the member for New England gave them populism and division, pork barrels and false hope. The most recent thought bubble is a royal commission into the retailing sector. It's not really about the retailing sector; it's about the aspirations of the member for New England. This is from the party which voted against a banking royal commission on no less than 23 occasions. I say: shame on them. Of course the National Party represent the majority of the country's poorest electorates. That's the way they like to keep them—poor—because that's what works best for them electorally. There is a political model: divide the community and back a side. The National Party aren't about unity and community. They are about dividing, pushing the issues and taking a side—and then, of course, from time to time feeding them a few crumbs to keep them voting for the National Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One small example is the Regional Investment Corporation. Now, think about it: the National Party thinks that you create jobs by moving them from one place to another. Well, of course, that doesn't work. The interesting thing about the Regional Investment Corporation is they don't mention it anymore. I was fascinated when, yesterday, the member for Calare asked the Deputy Prime Minister a question about drought. The Regional Investment Corporation is supposed to be about drought. That's what they tell us. Wouldn't you think the Deputy Prime Minister, answering a question from the member who represents Orange, where they put the Regional Investment Corporation, would have mentioned that organisation? I didn't hear the words pass his lips. You've got to wonder why. Maybe it's because it was stillborn—still no CEO, still no staff, still no office, and still no work to do. It's $28 million of taxpayers' money for a boondoggle, a pork-barrelling exercise that will eventually achieve nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us just pretend for a moment that, maybe, the Regional Investment Corporation was a good idea for a local community in that it was going to create jobs and economic activity. Then, if you were going to utilise it, dispatch it to do that, you'd pick a town like Mackay, with eight per cent unemployment; Rockhampton, with eight per cent unemployment; or maybe Shepparton, with six per cent unemployment. No, it's going to Orange, with 3.8 per cent unemployment. We know why it's going to Orange. It's because that's where the Nationals lost a state seat for the first time in about 69 years or so. That's why it's going to Orange. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one will forget the pork barrels and the boondoggles, but all of them were signed off by cabinet, the Prime Minister of the day and the Treasurer of the day. And there's one constant in all of that—it's the now Prime Minister of this country. You can nearly forgive Barnaby Joyce for his antics; that's just him. But why would the now Prime Minister sign off on all this waste and mismanagement? Why would the Prime Minister allow the member for New England to move the pesticides authority from Canberra to Armidale? Why would he do that, knowing the damage it would cause the authority, the farmers, the veterinarians and the companion animal owners who rely on the authority for the safe medicines and other products they receive? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know what it was about. It was all about managing the member for New England. Today, he is a bigger management issue than ever before. And why? Because this Prime Minister decided he'd manage him by giving him a promotion. Let's make him the drought envoy, and that'll keep him quiet. We'll give him extra staff and resources. He'll be able to fly around the country and he'll be happy. Well, that worked well! I wonder what the member for Parkes is thinking about this and will pass comment on in his contribution today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been doing the numbers myself—I know this area just a little—and I reckon the 22 members of the Nationals party room are split three ways: seven, seven, seven, plus one—Barnaby Joyce. There are those sticking with the Deputy Prime Minister, there are those pushing for the member for New England and there are those in the middle who are just in despair. I suspect the member for Parkes is in that corner. The member for Calare must surely be in the corner of the member for New England, because he got the Regional Investment Corporation, although it hasn't manifested into anything yet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One minister today got it right, I think, when he said, as reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 'They have lost their minds'. But Bernard Keane, in Crikey, might have trumped him when his headline read, 'The return of Joyce is the final insult to an angry electorate'. There's only one way to get us all talking positively about the opportunities in rural and regional Australia. There's only one way to restore services in rural and regional Australia, and that, of course, is to elect a Shorten Labor government. I say bring the election on—and bring it on now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

People might express some frustration and talk about things that maybe they're not completely happy about, but there are a couple of things I say that brings their attention and makes them focus. The first thing I say is, 'Shorten Labor government,' and then a bit of a grey pallor appears. Then I say, 'Joel Fitzgibbon, agriculture minister,' and that completely spooks them.

                  </a>  They remember the member for Hunter because he was the defence minister who got sacked. Of course they remember the member for Hunter! They remember the member for Hunter because he represents iconic towns like Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley and Cessnock, which have a great heritage of mining but have a member who doesn't give a toss about miners. Of course they know who the member for Hunter is. We sit here and we've just had 10 minutes of the member for Hunter pontificating about a scenario that is so far from the truth it's ludicrous, and talking about leadership and representation of regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of my career I've sat up that way, but I was on that side of the chamber in 2008. I sat in the chamber on one particular day when the vote was lost to retain the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. That money was set aside by the good management of the Howard government for the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. Where did it go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into $900 cash handouts to dead people and people living on the Greek islands. That's where it went. For six—</span>

                  </a>  The member for Whitlam might like to zip it because I didn't say a word while the member for Hunter was speaking. For six years there was nothing in telecommunications for the bush. In the last five years, 600 phone towers have been commissioned. I've seen them. On another day in 2008 or 2009, I remember the member for Watson saying, 'We will no longer use the word 'drought'. 'Drought' has been replaced by 'dryness'. We won't use that word; we will now just talk about dryness. We'll give a few crackers, a few dollars, to an area somewhere over in Western Australia, and we'll do a trial to prove that this is a permanent situation. We no longer have droughts; we now have permanent dryness.' That was the Labor government's attempt at any sort of drought policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might remind the member for Hunter that we've spent $1.8 billion on this drought, and one of the reasons—if he had any understanding of agriculture at all he would know this—our farmers are doing so well is that they managed to get into this drought with better water systems. They were able to get the tax advantages and they managed to use the water infrastructure fund to improve the water supply. They had grain storages put up because of the tax incentives to do so, and they were able to manage their larger properties because of the GABSI program where the drains were replaced with piping and capping, enabling management of their pasture for a much longer time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in regional Australia have understood, over the last five years, what it's like to have a government and members that understand their needs. That's why they're seeing the rollout of the Inland Rail. That's why we're seeing, as we speak, contracts that have been let and rail lying along the side of the corridor between Parkes and Narromine, ready to be laid. There will be a corridor of commerce that will go all the way from Melbourne to Brisbane. It will not only improve the efficiency of road transport but also enable exporters from regional Australia to have better access to ports at a cheaper rate of freight. Within a year or two, in 2020, we'll see the Pacific Highway completed, largely because of a deal that was done by Warren Truss to fund 80 per cent of that from the Commonwealth. We've just seen the announcement of the funding of the Coffs Harbour bypass and, Mr Deputy Speaker, the magnificent infrastructure in your electorate—that magnificent bridge over the Clarence River at Yamba. Funding from the Commonwealth government enabled that to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The members opposite don't really understand what makes regional Australia. I can tell you: it's the people. We don't believe in just patronising people and throwing them on welfare. That's their method. Our method is to actually encourage our young people. Through the Clontarf Foundation we've now got excellent attendance at school. Last year, the graduation of Aboriginal students at Dubbo Senior College was 58, the largest number in any school anywhere in Australia. I went to that graduation. Those young men and women were going into employment; they were going into further education; they were going into training; some of them were going into the Army—because they were encouraged to stay at school through a program that does not patronise those people but gives them encouragement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment in my electorate had the third-biggest drop anywhere in Australia. Half of New South Wales—3.8 per cent. The unemployment in Dubbo was 2.2 per cent. The member for Calare was here, and the member for Hunter gave him a bouquet, talking about how wonderful the unemployment rate was in his electorate in Orange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has opened up trade agreements where the Labor Party feared to tread. We've seen FTAs with Japan, China and Korea, which have opened up great trade possibilities for exporters right across the nation, particularly in regional Australia. Just yesterday, through this place, there was the TPP-11, the gold-standard trade agreement across the Pacific region, 11 nations competing on a level playing field of trade which will give enormous opportunities for our exporters. The Labor Party believed it wasn't possible. They thought it was a ridiculous notion to pursue that. We're also seeing an FTA about to be ratified with Peru. I've recently been in Singapore undertaking negotiations on behalf of this country for the RCEP trading group. We are commencing our negotiations with the EU. We understand that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've funded the Building Better Regions Fund. In Bourke, in my electorate, we've got an abattoir now that will employ up to 300 local people and harvest the feral goat population that is ever-present in western New South Wales, creating permanent jobs in that western part of New South Wales and export income for Australia through targeted, sensible investment in regional towns.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite like to take the high moral ground with renewable energy and climate change. I defy any of those people to have a greater example than the Parkes electorate. There are the large-scale solar farms at Nyngan, Broken Hill and Moree; a wind farm at Silverton and another one going up at Coolah; and the highest uptake of individual solar by households right across my electorate, including Dubbo. Farmers are investing in water infrastructure that's generated by solar electricity. Just recently I saw an irrigation pump that was powered by a hectare of solar panels. That farmer got some assistance from the state government, but with the new legislation that went through a month ago he'll be able to write that off his tax in one year. Changes we've made, which came through this House in the last sitting period, allow instant write-off for grain storages, hay, fencing and water.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing a massive amount of investment because on this side we understand regional Australia. We don't go out with platitudes; we don't buy the RMs and the big hat and go out and speak slowly so the poor folks in the country can understand us, as I've seen in the past. We understand the people we represent. We understand that working Australians are the heart of this nation and we support them, unlike those opposite, who have been captured by the latte-sipping set from the leafy suburbs of the capital cities. They come in here and have the hide to bring up a matter of public importance as puerile as this one. You'd think the member for Hunter might come up with something more original. It seems we have a bit of deja vu all over again, every couple of weeks. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  There are 12 sitting days for this parliament between now and Christmas, and, instead of coming up with a plan to deal with the issues that are confronting people in regional Australia, the best thing that this proud National Party can do is go to war with themselves. You know that they're in strife when the most productive thing they've got to say is about us. They've been given all this time to talk about their plans for regional Australia and the best thing they can do is to attack us. No wonder they are in such strife!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reason why they don't have a plan for regional Australia: they've had three Prime Ministers, three Treasurers, three Deputy Prime Ministers and, I kid you not, since the last election to today they have had four ministers for regional development. Is it any wonder that they haven't got a clue when it comes to the issues facing people in regional Australia? Is it any wonder that they can spend 18 months trumpeting a decentralisation plan? Eighteen months ago they heralded, with great fanfare, that they had a plan to decentralise government work from Canberra, to send it out to the regions. Well, we waited with bated breath. We were told there was a hard deadline in December last year. We thought there were going to be some big announcements coming, along with Santa Claus, but there were no announcements and no decentralisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, with great fanfare, on budget night we saw the Deputy Prime Minister issue his famous press release saying, 'Decentralisation in our time'. But if you looked at the numbers, there were 100 jobs decentralised. And, if you looked at the fine print, 80 of those 100 jobs involved moving workers from one capital city to another capital city! Our favourite was the 34 jobs that moved from Sydney to far west Parramatta! This was their decentralisation plan. Is it any wonder that these guys are starting to ask questions of themselves?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to see the member for Capricornia starting to ask some questions of her side today as well. This is the one who is welcoming Barnaby back with great hope. While she's doing the numbers on their own backbench, she might start looking at doing some numbers on decentralisation in her own electorate. While she's been here in Canberra and in other places around the country, talking about their great initiative in decentralisation, under her watch—under her government—we've seen 50 Public Service jobs ripped out of her electorate. That's what National Party-style decentralisation gives to you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it were just decentralisation and if that were the level of hypocrisy and carnage, you'd say, 'Fair go, these guys are dealing with a drought.' And the drought is having devastating effects throughout eastern Australia, there is no doubt about that. But it's the ideas drought on their side of the chamber that is having the most impact. I was pleased to hear the minister talk about telecommunications. These guys have had 18 plans in 13 years and still could not deliver a broadband plan for regional Australia. I've got to say that it takes a lot of genius to say, 'We'll only spend $36 billion on the NBN'—their fibre-to-the-node second-rate NBN—and then have to fess up and say, 'We've actually spent $50 billion,' only to deliver a service which is no better than that which they replaced. Is it any wonder that NBN complaints have gone through the roof under this mob here, with a 53 per cent increase?</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  I hear the minister complaining. They bagged it, they voted against it—year after year after year—and now they're putting press releases out saying, 'Thanks to us you've got the NBN!' These guys are the champions with the jam tin on a string. If we were to leave it to them, that would be the broadband connection that people in country Australia would get. Under their watch, complaints in the telecommunications sector are at four times the level that they are in the financial services sector, and we got a royal commission in the banking and financial sector. These guys reckon that business as usual is okay and that they're going very, very well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  Labor does have a plan. It's the same plan they had last time. It's a plan to tax more. It's a plan to spend less in the regions. It's a plan to make life harder for regional Australia. I know this plan. I know this plan because the people I represent remember this plan. They used this plan last time. Come on, member for Hunter, I'd hoped you'd come up with something original.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's reflect on the plan last time Labor were in power. There was massive uncertainty under water. Remember those public meetings? Thousands of people turned up. They pulled out water infrastructure. When Senator Penny Wong was water minister, she said that not only is there no future in this block, you have to pull up the water infrastructure from that block and shut it down for five years. Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? Those blocks that were shut down by Penny Wong for having no future are now getting replanted in my patch. That was their plan. Wait, there was another plan they had: shut down live exports. That was by former Prime Minister Gillard, which offended our markets. The one thing about markets is you have to give guarantee of supply, and we shut those down. They locked up infrastructure. There was no delivery on water by the member for Watson. I remember walking around this place as president of the Victorian Farmers Federation, trying to get them to commit to the Sunraysia Modernisation Project. They wouldn't do it. You know what, it's built. It was committed to by us and built by us. We remember your plan, Labor, and your plan isn't so original, I've got to say. Your plan is the same old plan: tax more, spend less in the regions and make life harder for regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to touch on our plan. Our plan has been one of delivery. We have free trade agreements with China, Japan, Korea, Peru, Indonesia, and Trans-Pacific Partnership 11. We're opening up markets everywhere. If you opposite got in power, we know what you'd do: you'd shut those down. We're investing in rail and investing in airports. There's the $20,000 instant tax write-off, which actually helps small business and actually helps to stimulate the retailers. Six hundred mobile phone towers were turned on. That is our plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor still has the same plan in Victoria. I'm pleased to be given the opportunity now to compare what's going on in Victoria in the lead-up to the election. Did you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in a number of days the Victorian Labor government will go into caretaker mode. You would think that they would be having a bit of a dip if they wanted to deliver for regional Victoria. I happen to represent 36 per cent of the state—the best part of the state. The National Party, in that 36 per cent, in the lead-up to this election, have committed $10 million for sporting facilities in Mildura, renewal of passenger rail to Mildura and Horsham, a 32-bed extension of the Mildura hospital, a $44 million new hospital in Swan Hill, a $7 million drug rehab centre and an $80 million rail upgrade. You would think at least one of those would get a 'Me too!' from the Victorian Labor government if they wanted to get re-elected. Not one is—no sports stadium, no passenger rail for regional areas, no 32-bed extension for the Mildura hospital, no $44 million new hospital in Swan Hill, no $7 million drug rehab centre and no $80 million rail upgrade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to tell you something else about a plan. I came to this place five years ago and I said, 'I want to see a radiation treatment bunker for Mildura.' A few days ago it was committed to. The federal government has backed this. What we need to see from the Victorian government is the ability to allow public patients to use that, to come on board. They go into caretaker mode in less than a week, but have they come on board? No. No plan for regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see they have gone all quiet on that side. That's because when you put it all down on paper and lay it all out, there are millions and millions of dollars in regional Australia that have been delivered by the National Party, but not even an attempt by the state Labor government to match it, and not even an attempt to match it by the Labor Party in this place. The shadow minister for agriculture wants to be the man, but he isn't muscling up to the task. He's had all that time in opposition, and all he's got to present to this parliament is the same Labor plan, which is a plan to tax more, a plan to spend less in regional Australia and a plan to make life very difficult for the people who live in regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I'll just remind the chamber that the member for Mallee last year was the only government MP not to put his name to a dissenting report rejecting a parliamentary paper criticising the NBN. He said he believes some of the complaints about this rollout have some merits. I think that goes to show that, while the previous government speaker was going on about how wonderful the NBN has been under this government, the member for Mallee seems not to completely agree with this statement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to look at what's going on opposite. We've had three Prime Ministers and two Deputy Prime Ministers with maybe another one coming back again. Chaos and dysfunction are the hallmarks of this government. Today the chaos and dysfunction continues, and, if it weren't so funny, it would be quite sad. Actually, I do feel quite saddened by what is going on. The muppet show is now performing in New England and Wagga Wagga, Statler and Waldorf going toe to toe—or is Grover from Maranoa getting ready to make his move? While this muppet show goes on, as people jockey for position, it's the people of regional Australia who are getting left behind, and this is why I'm feeling very sad about what is happening to the state of affairs in this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state and my electorate there has been nothing but a litany of failure: cuts to our local university campus; cuts to our schools, our hospitals, our TAFE; axing of visiting medical specialist services; and a failure to deliver the mobile phone blackspot program where it is actually needed. The rolling out of a second-rate NBN to our two biggest cities, Burnie and Devonport, has put our region at a competitive disadvantage. Thank you very, very much! This government wanted to put the west coast of Tasmania, which is mineral rich—you used to have to send files on discs to Mineral Resources Tasmania—on satellite. Those mining companies couldn't even operate on satellite. It took the community to stand up and push back, and they finally have the 'wonderful' fibre to the node, which is not what they were after but is what they got. The government was bizarrely replacing old copper with new copper in a place like the west coast, which has some of the highest rainfall in the country.</span>

                  </a>  Oh, is that laughter over there? Yes, it is quite ridiculous, isn't it? Even today the government have not allocated one extra cent for the next tranche of Tasmanian irrigation projects. There has been inaction since the dairy crisis of 2016, when I did ask the then agriculture minister to come to Tasmania and speak to my dairy farmers and he refused. They have failed to secure export protocols for our blueberries into China, overseeing an agriculture labour shortage, with the only solution being a thought bubble developed with no consultation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to go to this labour shortage and their thought bubble about getting people who are on benefits into the agriculture sector. If you ever needed evidence that the government have lost the plot, look no further than this thought bubble, which is full of hot air. It's like a brain fart, really. It's their very simplistic solution to a complex problem. In my state, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association does not support this thought bubble. Neither does the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and neither does the Tasmanian Council of Social Service. It's unique when you can't even get the farmers to agree with a solution with that side of the House, who say they're all about regional Australia and farmers. Who did they actually consult on this idea? I think it was—I don't know; was it their own backsides? I'm not sure. But no-one actually supports this thought bubble.</span>

How are they going to get there? Some of these people don't have cars, and many of these people are in my electorate. The farms are in my electorate, and did they even bother to speak to the farmers there? No. But I have. They know that that is not the solution to this issue at all. This is another policy failure from a government that have lost touch with the regions. The muppet show rolls on, but our regions need people who will stand up for them, and that is the Labor Party.</span>

I know you haven't been around that long, Member for Braddon, but if you read your history you will find that the Howard government actually put $2 billion into a telecommunications fund for the future of the rural telecommunications industry. It was the very first thing that Kevin Rudd hoovered up to build his NBN, which he said he would build for $4.5 billion. I might point out that for the mining communities on the western side of Tasmania your side of politics proposed that it be delivered by satellite. We have done exactly the same on that front.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition believes in regional Australia and that's why we provide good policy. Since the change of government in 2013, I can tell you that I have noticed a difference of the first order in my electorate—whether it be the significant steps taken very quickly by then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to make sure that the steel industry survived in Whyalla. It is a very important industry. We have a new owner and we are going to knock the spots off that place, and the government stands ready to help Sandhu Gupta with his vision in Whyalla. Or whether it be the duplication of the Joy Baluch AM Bridge in Port Augusta, something I'm sure you know about, Deputy Speaker Hogan, because that's exactly where you come from. The $200 billion that will fix up this bottleneck and safety valve for Port Augusta comes from this government. The dual lanes straight through the middle of Port Wakefield and the overpass on the northern side show that this government has an absolute vision for those who live in the country. The Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, the $20 million that went into the Upper Spencer Gulf as a depressed region—we are backing businesses to employ more people and grow their businesses. There is the BBRF, the Building Better Regions Fund, which has contributed more than $40 million into my electorate and there is the Mobile Black Spot Program. The mobile black spots were raised by the other side of the chamber—they said it was their money that built it. Good grief, give me a break! Not one mobile phone tower was delivered by that side of the chamber when they were in government for six years. We have put $120 million into that project and we'll deliver over 800 new towers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to say that I was a farmer before I came into this place. It is in agriculture, the underlying industry that finances regional Australia, that I think the government has done some of its finest work. We had the ag white paper and we have doubled the FMDs. Incidentally, the Farm Management Deposits were instigated by the Howard government. We've doubled the limits. We have brought the banks on board to allow offset against farm loans. We've accelerated the deductibility on water, fodder and new fencing. Let me tell you a story about fodder. We're pretty short of fodder at the moment and I know some farmers who invested in a big way to store a lot of hay. They have sold a lot of the hay and made a lot of money and the farmer said to me the other day, 'Do you know what we're going to do? Next time we get a good season we're going to use the money we made out of that lot to build more sheds and store more hay for the next drought.' That's what good policy delivers: good decisions on the ground. We've had the $20,000 instant tax write-off and the FTAs with China, South Korea and Japan. It's cleaned up the wine backlog—the wine glut. We've cleaned out those stocks, and the wine industry is once again soaring high. That's a very good thing for South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've moved well on drought. We have farm household support and the then Prime Minister announced that we would have $12,000 per farming couple as a cash bonus over the next 12 months. We've delivered extra money to allow people to apply for farm household support. We've got the drought concessional loans. We've got the farm finance concessional loans. We've put extra money into support for mental health for farmers who are under pressure at the moment. Because the members of parliament on this side of the chamber represent the vast bulk of regional Australia, we understand regional Australia. That's why we deliver good policy for regional Australia. That's why we have delivered great outcomes. I have really noticed what the last five years have been like compared with the six years before that. There has been a vast improvement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  At a time when people in the bush are looking for stability, the member for New England follows in the footsteps of his friend and colleague the member for Warringah, providing only doubt and destabilisation. We all heard his recent comments in the media almost daring his fellow National Party members to offer him his old job back—'Come on, I'm up for it; I'd be good.' I looked at him today when he was standing in the chamber to answer the question posed by the member for Hunter. You could see it was almost like a job interview—a role-play for: 'If you had me back, this is how great I can be. Look at what you're missing. Come on, give me a second chance.' Will they give him a second chance? That is the big question. To be frank with you, what a joke. Their constituencies deserve better. Some of the poorest areas in our country are so sadly represented by people who are, quite frankly, just prepared to accept any sort of crumb of leadership.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the many failings of the Liberal-National coalition when it comes to rural and regional Australia. There are the cuts to school funding. They might talk about 'record money being spent'—well, of course the population goes up and the funding goes up, but that just goes up by way of people being born. The higher the population, the more kids there are going to school. It's not actually about real increases to funding for education. And, as was mentioned before, every cut to schools impacts regional and rural schools far more than their city cousins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts to hospital funding and freezes to the Medicare rebate hurt people in the regional and rural areas far more than people in the cities. We already know there are people with a major health condition, such as cancer, for example. We all know plenty of people who are trying to battle that insidious disease. Well, those living in regional and rural areas have poorer survival rates than those living in the major cities. The further patients living with cancer are from the major cities, the more likely they are to die within five years of contracting cancer. That's totally unacceptable. How can this government continue to navel-gaze when the people of the bush, quite truthfully, are dying from a preventable disease? It's far more serious than the charades put forward in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the other big white elephant in the room is the NBN. We hear them joking about, 'When you had it, there were no complaints.' We thought of it, we rolled it out, and we would have administered it at a far higher standard than anyone in this joke of a government has ever done. It is the greatest infrastructure project this nation has seen in many decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking about infrastructure: I was privileged to be the deputy chair of a joint select committee put up to look at decentralisation and regional development. I can tell you that we travelled the country, and people from the regions were begging for decent infrastructure. Local government organisations were coming, looking not only for cash but also for creative ideas from a good government to really put some energy and some employment back in the region. Sadly, they are begging for that. Quite interestingly, I can't help but note that, in my tenure as deputy chair, I saw three chairs come through that committee. They were being promoted, demoted and moved all about this unstable government at a rapid rate. One of the most interesting points I did note from that was—if you remember back to April 2017—a dictum put forth from the then minister for regional Australia, Fiona Nash. She said that she was writing to every department to ask why they shouldn't decentralise and that they were going to have to respond by August. Well, 12 months has gone by since that—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what: it is a great travesty to treat our regions with such disrespect. People from the bush and people from the regions are some of the hardest working, most decent, most generous and most caring people. They're looking for good representation. They want to see our country go forward. They want to see their kids do well. They want to see them go to well-funded schools. They want to be able to go to a hospital and not sit in emergency for five hours plus. In fact, someone said to me last week: 'Meryl, my father-in-law went to hospital. He'd had a stroke. There was one doctor for 800 people, and now the thing that has happened to him has irrevocably changed his life.' That's because, as we all know, with stroke victims, you need to have very, very prompt attention. Well, that wasn't coming. That was in a big hospital. The government are a joke. They are not delivering the leadership that we need and deserve in our regions.</span>

I'm very, very proud to represent my part of the world, and I'm very proud of being an actual, active dairy farmer.

But first I will take you back to look at the simple things that matter most and to look at something that the previous government did. One of the first things that the then Minister for Education, Julia Gillard, did as part of the Labor government was to make significant changes to youth allowance. Any genuine rural and regional member in this place understands how important access to youth allowance and support is for young people who have no choice but to leave their small rural and regional community to go away to study. But the Labor government at the time made significant changes to youth allowance, which meant that young people in my part of the world could not get youth allowance at all. Labor deemed them to be in an 'inner regional' area, and, if you were in an 'inner regional' area, you weren't allowed to go to university—you weren't allowed to get independent youth allowance; you weren't allowed to go and have the same opportunities as someone in a city environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The then Labor government made changes to youth allowance to the point where young people were desperate. There were hundreds of young people and their families who came to me. I moved a private member's motion on it and took a consistent approach, a persistent approach, to what Labor did. Frequently, in the supermarket, a mum and a dad or a family would come up to me to say, 'Do you understand just what this is doing to our children and the future of children in rural and regional Australia?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you talk about leadership, why not talk about the leaders of the future and their education? But Labor made a major change to youth allowance which actually stopped young people from my part of the world going on to university. I had a mum who said to me, 'I've actually got five kids, and they are great kids; the five of them want to be GPs, but I can only afford to send one to university under these new rules.' How do you think she felt about that? But Labor didn't care about that at all. Labor did not care about the opportunities for rural and regional students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The members sitting opposite were not here at that time and did not see what it did to rural and regional students. It was absolutely horrendous, and you should hang your heads in shame over that, because it took a private member's motion in here to start to bring the then Labor government to its senses. It was okay to say that young people in rural and regional areas weren't able to access youth allowance! Obviously, you in rural and regional areas don't understand how critical this is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made significant changes that have allowed increased numbers of young people to actually pursue their dreams and go on to university and then to come back to rural and regional areas in time. And I'm very proud of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the damage was done. There were young people who actually changed plans, who said to me: 'I'm not even saying to my mum or dad—or my teachers—that I actually want to go on to university, because I know they can't afford it. So I'm taking another pathway and going into work.' They were the decisions that they made—life-changing decisions. That is what leadership is actually about in here: it's about making good decisions about young people, especially about their education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk briefly about our investment in mobile blackspot towers. When an anaesthetist who lives in Ferguson Valley had to park his car on a hill to be able to get calls, when he was on call, from the local hospital, you know there's a problem. But of course Labor didn't invest one dollar in mobile blackspots. And we have. When I look at the difference that that has made, right around my electorate, to that anaesthetist and then to the health care that's being provided to people in my electorate, I am very, very proud of this program. But I have no doubt that this was not a program that was supported by Labor then, and, if you're talking about regional leadership, this is a core part of it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I thank the member for Hunter for bringing forward this very important MPI, because it gives me an opportunity to read off a litany of evidence that shows very clearly that this government hasn't got a clue about regional Queensland, especially Townsville. Townsville's unemployment rate has almost doubled under the LNP, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments. When Labor left federal government in 2013, our unemployment rate was lower than both the state and national averages. Now Townsville's unemployment rate is higher than the state average and almost double the national average. Under the previous Labor government, manufacturing in Townsville soared. When Labor left federal government in 2013, more than 8,400 people were employed in manufacturing. But under the Abbott and Turnbull governments manufacturing nosedived, with job losses of 3,000. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Herbert the number of apprentices and trainees has almost halved, 46 per cent in fact, since the LNP took office. That's 1,557 fewer apprentices and trainees because of the LNP's $3 billion cut to TAFE. And now Townsville is experiencing massive shortages of skilled tradespeople. The LNP's changes to early learning will mean that 2,484 families in Townsville will be worse off to the tune of more than $2,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP's Medicare freeze has hurt Townsville badly. The LNP's freeze is forcing out-of-pocket medical expenses to rise and therefore forcing fewer people to see GPs. The high cost of medical services has stopped seven per cent of North Queenslanders accessing health care when needed in the past year. Six point five per cent of people in the north over the age of 15 have reported delaying or not going to a specialist, GP, imaging or pathology service between 2016 and 2017 due to cost. The northern Queensland region had the 10th highest rate of people delaying medical care due to the cost in that 12-month period. The median out-of-pocket cost in the year was $142 per patient. This is not the fault of GPs. It is the LNP government's fault. The researchers named the LNP policy causing the detrimental effects, finding the variation in the amounts patients spend out of pocket on health services was influenced by factors such as availability of bulk-billed services and non-hospital primary and specialist services subsidised by Medicare. The Medicare freeze has negatively impacted Queenslanders more than overall patients in metropolitan areas, who are less likely to have out-of-pocket costs than their relatives in regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the freeze led to? More people being admitted to hospital. Recent reports show that in the Townsville hospital the emergency department is treating an average of 55 people per day for minor ailments that they should be having seen to at the GP clinic. Twenty-six per cent of patients—that's 6,475 people over the last six months—are presenting at the Townsville hospital with minor ailments like coughs and colds, all because this out-of-touch LNP government would rather give tax handouts to big business and the big banks, as opposed to funding our hospitals. That is a disgraceful list of priorities. The cuts to health don't stop there. The architect of the health cuts has also cut $9 million from the Townsville hospital. That's on top of the Medicare freeze. What does that mean for our regional hospitals? It means a loss of four beds, 12 fewer doctors and 25 fewer nurses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the LNP's demolition of regional Queensland doesn't stop at health. There are cuts to our universities. The architect of the cuts, former Treasurer now Prime Minister Scott Morrison, signed off on $38 million of cuts to Central Queensland University. He signed off on $36 million of cuts to James Cook University. These cuts have seen Townsville's 14 JCU staff lose their jobs and the loss of an arts degree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the LNP cuts to the National Partnership on Remote Housing. This has seen seven jobs lost on Palm Island and some of those apprenticeships. In fact, they have entirely cut this program from Queensland because the LNP doesn't understand remote Queensland at all. The LNP Morrison government does not work for regional Queenslanders. They work for their banking and big business mates in Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor will fund hospitals. Only Labor will fund our schools. Only Labor will fund TAFE and universities. It will only ever be Labor that will get Townsville back on track, delivering jobs and apprenticeships and providing the infrastructure that we need to kick off our economy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  It's awful to be in this place and listen to that long, miserable diatribe from the opposition. If anyone tuned in to get a sense of what's really going on in regional Australia, all they would hear is this long, tedious, miserable series of negative statements. Member for Hunter, you've got to gee them up. You've got to generate some enthusiasm among your troops for what it's like to live, work and raise a family in rural and regional Australia, because the government members who actually do those things—and I've got many in the House with me today—celebrate the good. You will understand that very well, Deputy Speaker Hogan, given your location on the northern New South Wales coast. The member for Capricornia is sitting at the table. Frequently I meet with people in her shires, and what they paint for me is a picture of growing optimism, growing infrastructure and growing confidence. I don't think that would exist if those opposite were sitting here on the treasury bench.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend, typically for me, I travelled to celebrate a million-dollar investment in Yarrawonga Manufactured Housing. Under a massive cover in a small town on the Murray, we are building cabin-style accommodation, temporary affordable housing, that can be transported all around the country: to remote communities, to Indigenous communities, to lifestyle villages. It's all happening there. We're seeing investment in trades and in training, and the young people coming to town talk to me about the confidence they have in this government. It's the reason they feel they can move their families there—cue our decentralisation agenda!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I went through some outback country, towards Hay, to talk to farmers, and of course we talked about the drought. But they are there for the long term and they love where they live. I then went to a salami festival in a place called Euston, quite close to Mildura, where we celebrated the diversity of the Italian culture that's made that region so special. There were lots of different salamis there! But there were also lots of markets. There were people selling beer and gin. In fact, there was somebody who has one of those boutique gin distilleries in Mildura, in the member for Mallee's electorate. He was in a Hawaiian shirt, with a bowler hat, riding around on a trike and handing out some very nice gin. That's small business. He has the confidence to do what he's doing and know that this government will back him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government deliver for every single rural and regional Australian through our rural and regional members. We are rolling out a $75 billion 10-year program of investment, and one of the biggest infrastructure investments is the $8 billion Inland Rail. If you're someone who lives on the eastern seaboard, you might not see the relevance of this, important though your local commute to work is. But if you live in my electorate—and much of eastern Australia—you know the government has its eye on the future, because we will have an effective rail corridor running between Melbourne and Brisbane, through our regions, with good branch rail networks so we can deliver our produce to that network to go to the port of Brisbane, the port of Melbourne and in between.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said: small business. We've put in place the lowest tax rate in 78 years. Millions of small and medium-sized businesses across Australia, 20,000 in my electorate alone, will pay less tax five years sooner with new laws fast-tracking tax relief for the sector passing the parliament today. We've extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off. Over 4,000 businesses in the electorate of Farrer are taking advantage of this, and my region is no exception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communications? Yes, we can do more. I'd love to see more. I'm at the front line demanding more, as are all my rural and regional colleagues. But we remember the six years when Labor was in power. We didn't have a single mobile phone station anywhere for a whole six years. We've got a lot of catching up to do. We're getting there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to represent the regions, you have to live in the regions. I'm not saying I take a single vote for granted in my electorate of Farrer, and I know my colleagues don't in their electorates. If you don't know your rural and regional member of parliament—who they are, their face, their reputation—and don't have a sense of what they do then that member of parliament probably isn't doing a good job. You know you can't get away with it in regional Australia. That's why we work so hard: because we love what we do; we love the people we represent. We don't need the negativity that comes piling on with the pure political opportunism that we've heard in the debate on this motion. It's late on a Thursday afternoon and it's all about how awful it is in regional Australia. That would be the take-home message from anyone listening this afternoon. It's not our message.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  As I mentioned earlier, Labor supports this bill for very good reasons, and it's been great to hear the contributions from members from both sides of the chamber making the points that need to be made. I was pleased, previously, to point out, recognise, thank and acknowledge the members of the Australian Defence Force—of which I was proud to be one—who supported the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, in terms of the security and the counterterrorism joint task force that supported the civilian agencies, the police and the emergency services during that fantastic event. It was in the lead-up to the Olympic Games in Sydney that the current call-out powers for the Australian Defence Force were enacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Attorney said, the threat we face now is greater and more complex than when these laws were introduced almost 20 years go. As he also said, our law enforcement and security agencies and defence forces are amongst the best in the world. They are amongst the very best in the world. While our police and other emergency services are, and will remain, our first responders to terrorist attacks, the ADF does have specialist skills and capabilities such as tactical assault forces, and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response and recovery assets and skills. The amendments will facilitate the contribution of defence forces to domestic counterterrorism responses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Defence has already implemented a number of initiatives which have not required legislation, including but not limited to an enhanced counterterrorism liaison network, an enhanced program of specialist training, and streamlined police access to Defence facilities. This bill implements some of the recommendations of the review of Defence's support for national counterterrorism arrangements. The bill amends the Defence Act to do a number of things that have been outlined by previous speakers, and they are all important measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we are very aware of the Australian Defence Force's role in protecting the nation from external threats. Sadly, we are now facing internal threats to our national security from terrorists and others who want to attack us from within, in what has been termed 'domestic violence'. In this context, the term 'domestic violence', which obviously has other meanings, comes from section 119 of the Constitution, 'Protection of States from invasion and violence'. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, violence that's comes from within. The explanatory memorandum of this bill states that domestic violence, in this context, is 'conduct that is marked by great physical force, and would include a terrorist attack or other mass casualty incident'. So there needs to be a balance between the role of the ADF in protecting the population from terrorist attack and preventing misuse of the ADF for any kind of political purpose or oppression of the people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As speakers have pointed out in previous contributions, many of our recent arrivals, new Australians, have come here because of our free and democratic way of life. They may have come from countries where the armed forces have been used to suppress democratic activities and freedom of expression. I think that all speakers I've heard have been at pains to point out that this is not the intention or the effect of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Four principles underpin the proposed changes to the call-out provisions for the ADF. I think it's worth stating them, not only for those here but for the record. The ADF should only be called out to assist civilian authorities in that domestic context. If the ADF is called out, civilian authorities remain paramount, but the ADF members remain under military command. When called out, ADF members can only use force that is reasonable and necessary, and ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend the Defence Act by streamlining the legal procedures for the call-out of the ADF, and I think that's important. Obviously, in a high-stress and intense environment, where decisions need to be enacted quickly, any streamlining is welcome. This bill does that by making it easier for the states and territories to request the support of the ADF; simplifying, expanding and clarifying the ADF's powers; enabling multijurisdictional call-outs; and allowing preauthorisation for the ADF to respond to threats on land, at sea or in the air.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My experience, as I alluded to in my contribution earlier today, of working at the Police Operations Centre as part of the counterterrorism response for the 2000 Olympics was that when you have information coming in from assets on the ground and decisions need to be made between agencies in a multijurisdictional way—and in as coordinated a way as possible—any streamlining allows commanders and decision-makers more time to orientate, to observe, to decide and to act. Obviously, that is essential when trying to make good decisions that are going to result in the outcomes we want. And those are, obviously, the security of Australian nationals and visitors to our country in such circumstances. So the amendment allows streamlining. It also allows greater flexibility for the ADF to provide rapid, effective and appropriate specialist support in responding to terrorist incidents, while at the same time respecting state and territory positions as first responders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ADF's search powers in the current act focus on dangerous things and do not authorise the ADF to search for and detain people. ADF personnel will be authorised to search for and seize items and to search for and detain people who are likely to pose a threat to a person's life, health or safety or to public health or safety generally. Presently, the ADF can only be preauthorised to protect Commonwealth interests from air threats, and this power has been used to protect major events such as the Commonwealth Games or the G20 meeting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are sufficient safeguards in this bill: civilian authorities remain in charge; ADF members can only use reasonable force; and ADF personnel remain subject to the law and are accountable for their actions. As a result of those, I join others in supporting this bill.</span>

They have been a great advocate in finding a cure and promoting prevention and treatment for those with type 1 diabetes. In my electorate of Lindsay, 1,129 people live with type 1 diabetes, and JDRF does great work advocating on behalf of those people and 120,000 other type 1 diabetics across Australia each and every day. This number, sadly, keeps growing, and that's why it's vital to find a cure for this autoimmune disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to see the progress made under the Australian Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research Network, developed from an initial $5 million investment by the then Labor government in 2010. The funding for the CRN will be fully expended by June 2019. The CRN is an incredible tool for Australian scientists to lead the way on medical research for type 1 diabetes. Its continued impact is vital to paving a way for a cure. That's why the JDRF is advocating for phase 3 of the network, which will ensure enduring change for type 1 diabetics in Lindsay and also across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, this was brought to my attention by the wonderful Emma Hogan. I met Emma and her mum, Judy, for the first time in 2014. She's a young, proud JDRF advocate, and her dedication has inspired me to be a firm supporter of finding a cure and improving the lives of all type 1 diabetics and their families. Emma was diagnosed with diabetes in 2009, when she was just seven years old. She's now 16 and learning how to drive and do those other things teenagers like to terrorise us with. She can never, though, be carefree or laid back like my 16-year-old daughter, because her mind is always racing, asking the questions: 'What are my sugar levels at?' 'Have I calculated enough insulin to eat my lunch?' Twenty thousand finger pricks over her lifetime, and Emma is still no closer to being able to let go and relax like most teenagers should be able to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Life is, though, getting easier for type 1 diabetics, and it's only through the work of advocates like Emma and her peers that that can happen. We now have insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring—or CGMs, as they like to call them—and better day-to-day technology that has made and will continue to make their lives easier. But there is no rest until we find a cure for this lifelong disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JDRF needs $50 million to fund the next phase of the clinical research network to expand its research, start more clinical trials and ultimately find a cure that all of us are so desperate to have. Without the funding, the CRN will be unable to keep up their incredible work across the 65 institutions and 250 researchers that are trying to progress this research to the next vital stage, which will unlock a cure and new treatments for type 1 diabetics. A new funding commitment is needed now because in-depth and comprehensive research, as we know, holds the key to most things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But JDRF is more than just funding for research. It fosters a sense of community for the type 1 diabetic sufferers and their families through the programs such as the JDRF Peer Support Program, an incredible service run by volunteers that connects those affected by type 1 diabetes. It gives support, guidance and hope to those affected that they are not alone in the day-to-day struggles of understanding and managing their conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most important, though, are the friendships and the hopes shared at incredible events like the JDRF One Walk. I was pleased to be at the one that was hosted last year. I didn't get to participate in the walk, because I took my kids and one of them ended up passing out and was quite unwell. But it was great to be there, and the wave of support was incredible. But this year I don't have to travel far and go into Homebush for the walk, because Emma Hogan and her mum, Judy, are hosting the first-ever JDRF One Walk in Penrith this Sunday. I'll be very proud to support Emma and the amazing work she has done, and to be in attendance at Jamison Park with hundreds of others from around our electorate to see the incredible work they've put into bringing the type 1 community together and making the rest of our community more aware of their journeys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to say thank you to Emma and Judy for their long-term dedication and commitment to turning type 1 into type none. The JDRF One Walk will bring together the core of JDRF's message: funding for medical research and fostering community. Together we'll raise money for research while enjoying what is truly great about the JDRF community. I'll be there this Sunday and I will be walking. I will be ready for a fun day, with lunch, kids' activities and all the things that go into recognising the incredible work that Emma and the JDRF team have done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  This evening, in the time I have, I'd like to talk about disadvantage—not just any kind of disadvantage but an example of disadvantage that occurs across rural, regional and remote Australia. When I came to this place in 2013, you couldn't undergo an MRI scan in Mount Gambier. Mr Speaker, you and others in the House know that Mount Gambier is the second-largest city in South Australia. Yet, if you were required to undergo what is now a relatively common and often-used diagnostic investigation, you would need to travel to Adelaide. That is a five-hour drive there and a five-hour drive to return. It usually costs a significant amount of money, with inconvenience and overnight stays, et cetera. Or you could travel to Warrnambool, which is 2½ hours away in regional Victoria, where you had a choice of not one but two MRI machines that you could use. There were two in Warrnambool and none in Mount Gambier. In any event, I began a campaign to secure an MRI licence for Mount Gambier. I must say, thanks to the then Prime Minister, who visited Mount Gambier, we delivered on that commitment some short time thereafter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine my delight when I heard that, as a government, we are allocating an additional 30 MRI licences across rural, regional and remote Australia. I've turned my mind to that area in my electorate that is suffering disadvantage as Mount Gambier did. I've concluded that the Riverland, an area which is some 2½ hours from Adelaide and two hours or 1½ hours from Mildura, does not have access to an MRI scanner. Just like the people of Mount Gambier did, if the people of the Riverland are subject to the need for an investigation of this nature today, they have to drive to Adelaide or Mildura and back for what are sometimes 15-minute scans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I've done is begin a petition because, quite frankly, I'm campaigning for one of these remaining 20 licences—10 of them having been allocated to date—to be secured for the Riverland. There are an estimated 3,000 trips to Adelaide or Mildura unnecessarily taken by members of the Riverland community because that service isn't in the community. Can I also say that in discussions with an orthopaedic surgeon who happens to be a friend of mine, he believes securing a licence and, subsequently, a machine—I've written to the state minister and I've also had discussions with other service providers about taking up that opportunity—may well secure a permanent resident orthopaedic surgeon for the Riverland. After having issued the call for the petition, we've had over 1,200 signatures online. We've got more than 2,000 signatures in total. This is in a matter of days—not weeks but days. The community has come together. It understands what disadvantage is and it wants to do something about it. I'm certain that before the end of this month, when I collect these petitions and present them to this place, there'll be many more. That's the story of the community in general.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I tell the story of a constituent who wrote to me on this topic. The constituent writes: 'May I tell you how welcome your call for an MRI machine in the Riverland is to me. My son was born with a problem in his bones which was not discovered, because of his constant pain, until he was 19 years old. He's now 51 and has recently lost his wife to breast cancer, which included many trips to the city. It was taking them over four hours to reach appointments as he needed to take a break because of his back pain, and his wife also needed a break. After being a carer for more than 10 years he's returned to work part time and now requires further MRIs for his back and knee. He may have to travel twice to Adelaide, another eight-hour trip, with the cost of overnight accommodation. To say I support this petition is an understatement. I hope you have the overwhelming support of the community.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we do have the overwhelming support of the community. For community members out there who haven't yet signed the petition, please do it for me. You can do it online at www.tonypasin.com/mri petition. Alternatively, there are hard copies throughout the Riverland. Get on board and let's secure this licence.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I wish there were more people in this place who had the vision and commitment of Molly Chapman, who lives in Kanahooka in my electorate and is a student at Dapto High School. Molly is a member of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and has regularly attended my youth leaders round table. Molly can see the effects of climate change and what needs to be done. She sees the bleaching and dying of our Great Barrier Reef. She sees extreme weather events and the impact of the recent drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What concerns Molly is that currently many public schools are getting most of their electricity from the grid, which, in New South Wales, relies 76 per cent on coal-fired power stations. While plenty of schools already have some sort of solar system installed, these are typically quite small. Molly has hundreds of signatures calling on the New South Wales government to install larger 100-kilowatt solar systems at each of the 519 public schools in the state. Together, New South Wales high schools could be generating a total of 72 gigawatt-hours of electricity every year if 100-kilowatt systems were installed. This is enough energy to power around 14,000 New South Wales homes. Around 60,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions would be saved every year. This is equal to taking around 13,000 cars off our roads. Molly wants politicians like us to stop talking and thinking short term and start standing to act on our global and national challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of policy on climate change in Australia is a failure of Australian politics. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report calls for drastic action to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees of warming this century. The report was written by 91 climate experts and cites 6,000 peer-reviewed papers. Sadly, it has been dismissed by our government. The IPCC says countries need to make changes over and above those pledged in the Paris climate accord. Our Prime Minister, however, says we will meet our Paris agreement targets at a canter. Sadly, his department and Public Service agencies, in fact all scientists and the scientific evidence, disagree. Our efforts are far from adequate. We have abandoned evidence based policy, and bad politics has led to bad policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a real responsibility to protect our children, our grandchildren and our environment from dangerous levels of climate change. We have no choice but to get carbon pollution down. What is at stake is the loss of all of the world's coral reefs and other very important parts of our natural environment, threats to coastal communities through accelerated sea level rise and threats to human health through an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Each year we delay the cost of action and the risks of inaction keep rising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to comprehend that a matter so serious, with so much potential for widespread catastrophe, has been treated so lightly. We know that, per head of population, Australians are the biggest producers of greenhouse gases in the OECD. We know we could be doing more—much more—yet we prevaricate. We are one of few advanced economies in the world where pollution is rising rather than coming down. The recent defeat of the NEG framework was just the latest in a string of defeats for Australian policy and politics on climate change. Looking back, I don't think anyone can forget the jubilation on the faces of those opposite, back in June 2014, when the Liberals' legislated to repeal the last realistic plan that this parliament has passed to reduce carbon pollution in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to cutting our carbon pollution by 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach net zero emissions by 2050, as is consistent with our obligations under the Paris accords to keep global warming below two degrees above preindustrial levels. We have no choice. For the sake of people like Molly, our children and our grandchildren, for the sake of our environment and for the sake of the Great Barrier Reef, we can afford to prevaricate no longer. Bad politics cannot continue to trump good policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I'm pleased to follow the member for Whitlam, because, once again, we can actually define the difference between idealism and realism. On the call for 100-kilowatt solar panels, whilst it sounds like a fantastic idea, the reality is pretty straightforward. For the people who are listening to this broadcast, I think the reality is this: if the entire country ran on solar panels, then it would be available to power electricity only during the day on days when it is sunny, on days when there is no cloud, on days when there is no storm, on days when there is no monsoon. The proposal from those opposite is that for the times when people in this country might want to use energy, when there aren't those types of weather conditions, is nothing. Their proposal is to have no power at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a job for engineers. It is not a job for politicians to determine how we should design what is an incredibly complicated network—not only with transmission, not only with generation, but in terms of system strength and in terms of protection of incredibly expensive assets. One of the ways to do this is to implement ACCC recommendation No. 4 on driving down electricity prices. The reason I'm such a strong supporter of this is that it puts all of the ideology to bed. It does not matter which fuel source you support and it does not matter whether you think we should run the country on solar panels or wind. It will be a hard commercial decision. But the only way it will be a hard commercial decision is if we set the standards correctly, because you cannot compare a wind turbine or a solar panel, which are intermittent, with a gas turbine or a steam turbine or with traditional hydro. They are not the same. Reliability 24/7—it is completely different to something that is not firmed, that is intermittent and relies on the weather. The people of Australia should not have to look out the window to work out whether they can turn on their stove at night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredibly technical argument. The reality is that, if we go to the market with a true contract condition, not one based on ideology but based simply on price and reliability and a reduction in emissions, we will get a true result and we will finally put to bed all of the arguments about what is cheaper, what is more reliable and what actually works. I'm a strong supporter of that. We must set a reliability standard by which all fuels will be considered equally. This is the most appropriate and common-sense way to deal with this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're at it, we need to drive down prices. Approximately 50 per cent of the price of electricity is based on the cost of transmission lines and the write-down cost, particularly for state owned assets. Some $50 billion worth of transmission and distribution assets are owned by governments in this country. The rates of return for them are incredibly high, particularly given the fact that money is easily available at the moment and it is much cheaper than the rates of return that they are getting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also implement the general offer for a tariff for domestic use and, in my view, there also should be one for a food and fibre tariff across the country in order to help our ag producers, who, with the current price of electricity, simply cannot compete. I have growers in my region who are spending $100,000 on electricity, only to find that their crop is now worth less than what they spent to irrigate it. Anyone who is in business knows that is unsustainable. We should fix that up and provide a proper tariff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also eliminate late-payment structures—retailers are out there making an enormous amount of money from charging late-payment fees—particularly for those who continue to get a hard-copy bill. It might arrive after the due date. There is no possible way for you to pay that if you're not aware of it. It's just simply another way that retailers, in particular, are milking money out of the electricity system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of reliability: in my professional view as an electrical engineer, we have no choice but to extend the life of our existing generation. We cannot construct not only base-load power but all of the different types of considerations and combinations in a short period of time. We need this nation to have a reliable energy supply. We should leave it to the people who actually design these networks and who spend decades building their experience. We should get away from the ideological fight, and we should go back to hard, contractual facts with a set standard. Then we can forget all the arguments about what is cheaper and what is not, because it will be set and fixed by the market.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  What we just heard exemplifies the type of problem that we have and one of the challenges that are facing us. That is that we have a situation where the challenge itself has been specified—it has been outlined, researched and looked at a number of times—and yet we still manage, in spite of all that and in spite of the ways in which we can deal with the issue of climate change and the ways in which we generate power, to ignore it. We argue ourselves to a standstill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been here now for just over eight years, and I'll point out two things. During that space of time, I experienced for the first time ever in my part of Western Sydney a summer temperature of nearly 50 degrees Celsius. I grew up in Western Sydney. It's always been hotter than the CBD of Sydney, but it never got to 50. A few years ago, it got to 47½ at Penrith. We've never experienced that. People out in the general public know something is happening. And so we had that event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned my election eight years ago because in that time we tried to start the process of dealing with this issue. Back in 2010, my side of politics did a number of things to start addressing it—and I'll come back to those. The reason why I mentioned that this was eight years ago is that in the day in, day out of this place we tend to lose track of time because of the day-to-day skirmishes that we have and the fights that go on. So it's worth noting that it's eight years since we started trying to deal with this issue of climate change, because 10 days ago, on 8 October, a massive report was released that says we've only got 10 years left before we get to a point of irreversible climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had nearly 100 scientists from nearly 200 countries saying that we have to be fair dinkum and serious about slowing the growth of temperature rise on the planet. In fact, it says that it looks like we're going to increase to or exceed a 1.5-degree temperature rise by 2040.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If temperatures rise globally by 1½ degrees, then these are the types of things that will happen: the world's warm coral reefs, on top of everything that we've experienced to date, will experience at least 70 to up to 90 per cent loss. Putting aside all the debates that we've had so far in this area about the Great Barrier Reef Foundation's funding, we look set to lose not just a tourism asset but one of the biggest environmental assets for the country and for the world. At 1½ degrees, we will see the consequences of climate-related risks to health: older people who will drop dead because they are unable to cope with the type of heat that we'll see. There will be the impact on our livelihoods, our food security and our water supply, and on human security between countries. There will be the movement of people because they cannot live in their countries anymore because of climate change. And, obviously, there will be the impact on economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The onus is on us to find a way to limit that temperature growth. We are going through a period where it doesn't make economic sense anymore to have coal-fired power. We can now generate power much more cleanly and much more cheaply than before. Those who argue on one side of their mouths that we shouldn't subsidise renewables, because they think that subsidies are impure, but who on the other side of their mouths—like we just had with the previous speaker—argue that we should subsidise farmers because of the increase in power prices just beggar belief. I can't understand why that's the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, the coalition have tried a number of times to do something other than what has been argued. They tried Direct Action—it's gone; they don't talk about it anymore. They're not talking about subsidising renewables, but they'll talk about subsidising coal when no-one else will do that. They're even talking about the possibility of nuclear power—ignoring the fact that it'll take 15 years or so to get nuclear power up and running here anyway. It makes no sense. And we are all being judged, as lawmakers, for our inability to get this right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can generate power better—more efficiently and cleanly. We have got to do what it takes to make sure that, when we look at our own kids, we can answer their questions and say: 'We did everything we could to slow down the growth and to make sure you had as good a life as we enjoyed back in our time.'</span>

                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  A couple of weeks ago, I visited a property out to the east of Burra. It is severely drought-affected. I inspected a paddock there with the young farmer. She had had it shut up for 18 months to preserve feed for their animals. It was completely bare—it was dust; it was drifting—simply because it had been completely eaten bare by kangaroos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, pastoralists are reporting to me that, because of the drier conditions, there are thousands of kangaroos perishing in the environment at the moment. And it's a pretty horrid death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that there are 45 million kangaroos in Australia, far more than when European settlement occurred, simply because we're putting stock-watering points right across this nation and their numbers have grown on the back of that. So the question is: 'Why don't we harvest more kangaroos?' I suppose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, we have 1.6 million western grey kangaroos and 2.7 million red kangaroos. In 2017, we set harvesting targets of 766,000, but we harvested only just over 100,000 or only about 12 per cent of the total number. What is going on? The simple answer is: the field processors, or—let's call them what they are—the shooters, can't make a living. The international markets simply are not there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to ask yourself why that is, because kangaroo meat is very good indeed. It has almost no saturated fat; in fact, it only has about a two per cent fat content anyhow. There is more iron in it than in beef. It has got about double the vitamin B12 and high levels of vitamin B. Kangaroo-skin leather is some of the finest leather you will ever buy or wear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, theoretically, the world should be beating a path to us for our kangaroo products and trying to get as much of them as they can. But they're not. Why is that? It's because the markets have been destroyed by environmentalists—those with an environmental bent who think they are saving the environment. In fact, the damage they're doing to the environment at the moment is enormous. The cruelty they're causing to kangaroos, which are in overpopulation, is very cruel indeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the middle of this year, we saw the release of a movie called <span style="font-style:italic;">Kangaroo</span>. It was called a documentary. I thought documentaries were supposed to go somewhere near the truth. It was called 'a love-hate story'. I'm not sure who funded it; it seems to be difficult to find out. But we know it was endorsed by then Greens senator Lee Rhiannon and by the New South Wales Animal Justice Party MP Mark Pearson. They travelled across Europe and North America—where the movie went off like a storm—telling people that the red, western and eastern grey were all threatened species. What a load of rubbish! It is an absolute lie. It's so much easier to run a scare campaign based on a lie than it is to get the truth out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of this ongoing action over a long time has meant that California has banned kangaroo products, that Nike and Adidas are phasing out kangaroo leather and that our environment is overrun with kangaroos. Firstly, that is causing enormous problems for those of us who try to make a living off the land, pastoralists and farmers, as the kangaroos come in, in their hundreds and thousands. And the kangaroos are getting killed on the roads. People are getting killed on the roads because they're avoiding them; they're trying not to knock over these terrific animals. But there are just far too many of them. The bottom line is: they are actually doing huge damage to the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those people who want to back these campaigns and to bankroll the conservation groups that are trying to destroy this trade, I just ask them to think again—to give this due consideration and make sure they get the facts before they make their decisions. Everybody should make decisions based on good facts, and the 'facts' that that documentary and others used are just not facts. They are in fact mistruths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we've probably reached our time, Mr Speaker, so thank you for your tolerance. I'd just advise people who are thinking of supporting these groups to have a very hard look at what they are actually saying and what they're planning to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Recently, I hosted a Fowler Labor for Aid forum, with the aim of promoting productive discussion on Australia's current foreign aid contribution. Notable speakers for the night were: Sabrin Farooqui, a Western Sydney Labor for Aid representative; Wayne Gum and Joy Kyriacou, from Oxfam; as well as Kate Lee from APHEDA. It was extremely encouraging to see so many people from my electorate turn up to this function and express their concerns about Australia's current contributions to assisting developing countries as well as the strategies employed by the current government. They all believe that we can be doing more. My electorate in Fowler, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, is one of the most diverse and multicultural in the whole of Australia. Therefore, it's only fair, I think, that electorates like mine are concerned about the significant drop in our foreign aid contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an ordinarily difficult field of work, organisations such as Oxfam and APHEDA must cooperate with foreign governments and organisations, overseas unions et cetera to ensure that the money allocated to foreign aid is being spent properly and productively. This has been made more difficult as a result of the current Liberal government's lack of generosity to underdeveloped countries. Australia has committed to ending extreme poverty by 2030, a commitment that was made together with the international community to help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the current Liberal government has shown that it does not take this commitment seriously, as it has slashed $11.3 billion from our overseas international development assistance budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the forum, it was highlighted by both Wayne and Kate that Australia's current aid contribution amounts to 0.22 per cent of our gross national income—a figure that is far too low in comparison with our global commitment to reach the UN spending target of 0.7 per cent. As a generous and caring nation, with our provision of international development assistance, it is crucial that our foreign policy remains consistent with Australia's values and our national interest. The discussion that took place at the Labor For Aid forum made one thing clear: when it comes to helping those in need across the globe, we can and must do better.</span>

Our nation's future hockey stars are still being produced with a strong representation and fantastic results across all levels of the New South Wales schools hockey championships by a lot of Grafton schools. The Westlawn Public School girls under-12s were the joint winners in the PSSA championship. I congratulate Mia Hayne, Zahli Shannon, Sophie Hinterholzl, Eliza Berrick, Grace Milligan, Shani Firth, Heidi McClymont, Mia Grieve, Alice Hughes, Shanae Crispin, Lily Plunkett-Phelps, Izzy Miller, Layla Kingsley and Lila Heyman. The team was coached by Lauren Hadley and managed by Jason Pereira. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grafton High School's boys open team were the winners of the combined high school championships. So congratulations to Toby Power, Jake Lambeth, Tyler Gaddes, Kyle Mcilveen, Riley Power, Tyler McGarvie, Zac Gleeson, Jason Durrington, Jackson Nilon, Joseph Lynch, Benjamin Crispin, Harry Watts, Jessie McGarvie, Harry Hughes and the coach, Scott Smith. But it keeps going, because in the McAuley College open boys, they won the state championships for the fifth time in 12 years. So, again, congratulations to Sam Bloomer, Aaron Asby, Abe Herbert, Eli Fahey, Luke Solomon, Nathan Eddy, Joseph Maunder, Jesse Day, Bodhi Burchell, Elliot Speed, Hamish Speed, Rhys Cropper, Noah Burchell and Abe Dougherty. </span>

They were coached by Alana Keats. Again, it was a magnificent effort by all the Grafton schools in such a high-performing competition.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  We are indeed privileged in this place, in Australia's parliament, to be in one of the most digitally and physically connected environments in Australia. This morning, we've experienced significant network outages which have occasioned some degree of inconvenience and frustration to people working in this building. But, of course, that's brought home to me the importance of digital connectivity for our constituents, not just in the cities but also in the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been very pleased to participate in the government's Mobile Black Spot Program, seeking expressions of interest from people within my electorate to make submissions about where they see there is a lack of connectivity. We should all recognise that this issue of digital connectivity is front and centre not just for business but also for families. Indeed, the European Union recognises that access to the internet is a human right. The feedback that I and my office have received with respect to the issue of mobile black spots is significant. There are areas in the Tamar Valley and in the north-east of Tasmania that have been entered onto the database of mobile black spots as meriting some attention with respect to mobile black spots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've recently served as Deputy Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth. We had an inquiry into the potential for digital trade. This really emphasises how a digital future may produce significant potential for small and larger businesses all across Australia. The concept of trade itself has evolved over time. It used to be that trade was highly specialised. Indeed, until relatively recently it involved large organisations putting goods onto container vessels and travelling across the world. But a digital future now enables the smallest of enterprises to act as a large enterprise and to trade from a kitchen or a garage in much the same way that those digital giants that we now experience were first created in Silicon Valley. One example of that in Tasmania is in a small place called Legana in the Tamar Valley. It is a very picturesque place but a rapidly growing suburban area. It hosts an organisation called Pivot Maritime. Pivot Maritime is a world leader in marine simulation technology, only enabled because it's got access to world-class quality NBN.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  Albany needs a radiation therapy unit for those people affected by cancer. The people of Albany in the Great Southern know it, the local health professionals know it and the federal government, through the Department of Health, know it. On the basis of a thorough needs assessment, the government has granted $6.6 million to Genesis Cancer Care to install a radiation oncology treatment machine in Albany.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Genesis Cancer Care provide up to 65 per cent of the radiation therapy across Western Australia. They have a very thorough track record of providing a wonderful service. In Western Australia they provide services in Perth and in Bunbury. But the people of the Great Southern, including my home community of Katanning, have to travel up to 400 kilometres to receive treatment. That means dislocation from family, much higher costs than other people in the community have to bear and, sadly, as I was told when I met with a group of doctors last week, some people opting not to accept treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with Genesis Cancer Care in late June to find out how the progress of the installation was going. They told me that they need some support from the Western Australian government to make this machine viable. I undertook to contact the WA Minister for Health, Roger Cook, to facilitate a meeting and try to bring this installation about. I wrote to the minister in August, and to this point I've had no response. So I invited Minister Greg Hunt to Albany. He came a couple of weeks ago, and we met with a group of stakeholders, including the remarkable Mary Williams, who's been running this campaign for many years now. We were joined by Soroptimists International, the Denmark Community Foundation, and Mayor Dennis Wellington of the city of Albany and his CEO, Andrew Sharpe. We made a strong commitment as a group that we were going to fight to get this machine installed in the Great Southern. To that end I have started a petition, which can be accessed on my Facebook page. We will be gathering signatures between now and when we see a commitment from the Western Australian government to assist in the installation of this machine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I met with members of the Radiation Therapy Advisory Group here in Canberra. They expressed their support for a unit in Albany. I met with Genesis Cancer Care, Associate Professor Peter O'Brien, and also with Cancer Voices advocate Lee Hunt, who will be joining our call to muster community support. Today I send a strong message to Minister Cook: we will not stop fighting. The people of Albany and the people of the Great Southern will not stop fighting until he comes forward with some support to install this machine in the Great Southern.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  When it was first announced, more than 10 years ago, the national broadband network was a visionary policy for a fast telecommunications network to bring Australia into the 21st century. But over the last five years the NBN has become a shambles. Today, as the member for Bass pointed out, the parliament had a taste of what many of my constituents experience on a regular basis: dropouts, slow connections; unacceptable service in the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has received several complaints from people who have lost faith in the NBN. As we approach year 12 exams, with some people heading to exams today, I note that one of the most stressful things that can happen is your internet dropping out just as you're getting ready for that final exam in maths, chemistry, English or art. It's unacceptable, and the current government need to fix the mess they have created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Perth, people who live in the inner city, just a couple of kilometres from the main exchanges of NBN Co. and Telstra, would expect to have reliable services. It's not the case. One small business owner who has contacted me is working mum Helen Curtis, who lives in Mount Lawley. She runs an art consultancy dealing with large files, helping people build public art and engage with artists across Australia and the world. Her home network on the NBN was dropping out 120 times a day. She had to deal with two different telecommunications companies. She paid to rewire her entire house at a cost of many hundreds of dollars, only to have NBN Co. say, 'It's still not working. We don't know what the problem is.' It's completely unacceptable. So Helen, after six months of losing business and losing time and money, has switched to a wireless satellite connection from a provider that is not on the NBN. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Customers are literally walking away from the mess that this current government has created. When it was launched, former Prime Minister Turnbull said, 'This is a much smarter approach.' He has very kindly left that quote on his website, malcolmturnbull.com.au, where all of his transcripts from his time as Prime Minister still appear. But it's not a smarter approach. In fact, to quote the current Prime Minister's preferred moral philosopher, Forrest Gump, 'Stupid is as stupid does,' and where the NBN is at the moment is completely stupid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Helen is just one of thousands of Western Australian complainants who've lodged issues about the NBN with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman in the last year. Complaints in 2015-16 to 2016-17 increased by 50 per cent, and 5,000 of those complaints were from Western Australia. It is time that the government listened to those complaints and acted to fix the national broadband network.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in this place about a couple of great organisations in my community. Firstly, I'd like to thank Janine Barney, an inspirational woman in my electorate of Forde who founded the Golf Fore Women program at Windaroo Lakes Golf Club. This year the group had a record number of ladies attend their Chip and Sip event at Windaroo Lakes golf course to raise money for charity. They came together to support and enjoy a great game of golf and raise funds for breast cancer awareness. All dressed in pink, Janine's group raised over $1,000 to donate to breast cancer research. I've been to one of their previous events and I know they have a heap of fun. I wonder sometimes whether there's more sipping than chipping, but they have a great afternoon. I want to thank Janine for her passion for the local community and for supporting a very important cause in raising money for breast cancer awareness. I have no doubt that Janine and the whole team at Windaroo Lakes Golf Club will continue to build their women's golf program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge the terrific work done by the remarkable people at YFS at Slacks Creek. They are actually in my neighbouring colleague's—Jim Chalmers'—electorate of Rankin, but they provide services down into my electorate of Forde as well. YFS operates on the premise of connectedness: all people need a stable home; a decent income; they need to be safe and have connections with family, friends and community support; they need skills, education and training; and, finally, everyone needs hope for the future and the belief they can achieve their aspirations. Their time is spent dealing with situations where both critical and urgent care are the norm, where a problem solved can mean a life is saved, where previously insurmountable issues are solved with a phone call, where desperation can be replaced by hope, and where the threat of overwhelming violence and abuse is overcome by a safe haven.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are so lucky in our community of Logan that we have organisations such as YFS and the wonderful work that they do, and people like Janine and her team at Windaroo Lakes Golf Club. I want to commend all of their efforts for making our community what it is today. It ensures that the people who are struggling day to day, and who need help and assistance, have that help and assistance available. I'm very proud of all of their efforts, and that of the many others in our community as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  In my first speech to this parliament I recounted my slightly crazy-brave effort of doorknocking somewhere in the order of 12,000 houses over 18 months, including during the last campaign. The question which I continued to put to people day after day was, 'What's most important to you?' Overwhelmingly, the answer in my electorate was 'education', whether it was young people, families, grandparents worried about their grandkids, or migrants. It's a particular concern for migrants, and I have the highest percentage of migrants of any electorate in the parliament. They come to this country with a laser-like focus on education, seeing it as being the key for their kids having a better life. It's also important to Australia. The OECD and others have said that the two single most important things we can do for our future wealth and prosperity are education and infrastructure. If we look around Asia, our competitors, partners and collaborators are busy investing in education, while this government's cutting wherever it can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we last met, since the last session, Labor's announced some bold new policies, which should be lauded, applauded and recorded. If given the privilege of forming government, these will benefit all Australians. I put the emphasis on 'all Australians' because Labor knows that education is the key enabler of opportunity. It is the key enabler for a young person to fulfil their potential in life and the key to making sure that wherever you're born and whatever postcode you're raised in this does not determine your future. So I particularly call out and praise our commitment to universal preschool for three- and four-year-olds. This commitment would see a new national preschool and kindergarten program guaranteeing 700,000 kids a year access to subsidised preschool. It's the biggest ever investment committed to early childhood development. For the first time, every three-year-old in this country will be able to access 15 hours of subsidised early childhood development a week. This is giving kids the best start in life. It's universal access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know those opposite hate universal services. They fought for decades against Medicare, they fought in the seventies against the national disability scheme, they're fighting universal superannuation and they're fighting this. But it's based on evidence. Most importantly, I believe public policy should be based on evidence—climate change, anyone? The evidence here is overwhelming when you look at the Scandinavian countries and other countries that are moving ahead of us: better school results, better school retainment, better opportunities in year 12 and better overall life chances. The evidence says that for every dollar invested you get at least a $2 economic return through investing in early childhood development and early childhood education. But, of course, that investment alone is not enough. We need a workforce to support this great new commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've committed to scrapping up-front fees for 10,000 TAFE places for early childhood development educators, because demand is growing. At another time we'll also talk about our commitment to $14 billion over 10 years for public schools to make sure that every public school reaches 100 per cent of its fair funding level, and about working with the states and territories to achieve this. At the moment, because of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's cuts, almost nine in 10 public schools will never get to the fair funding level.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  I rise to advise the House of the passing of two local stalwarts, in Bundaberg and in Hervey Bay. Jim Quaite was a lifelong supporter of local hockey. He was an administrator, player, coach, known as a visionary and an extremely hard worker. In fact, as well as doing all of his voluntary work around hockey in our region, he ran an electrical contracting business, which has now been taken over by his son, Rob. Our commiserations to them at this time of grieving. Vale Jim Quaite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other person who I wish to make note of to the House today is Norma Hannant. Norma passed away in recent weeks. She was a stalwart of the Liberal National Party in Hervey Bay, renowned on the local pre-poll. In fact there was no pre-poll without Norma Hannant. She was 84 at the time of her passing. She was well-known by all of the local organisations in politics, whether it be those opposite, the Greens or minor parties, simply because, for the first 48 hours, you had to learn to do the pre-poll Norma's way. If you didn't do it Norma's way, you were off the coffee and cake list! Once you were sorted out and doing it Norma's way, you were brought free cups of tea and coffee. That's how we do politics in the regions. Norma was also very well-known for her work on Fraser Island. There from 1966, she was a huge supporter of the wild dingo population on Fraser. She was very passionate about what happened on that World Heritage-listed island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a famous statistical report. Norma was so passionate every single day she was on the pre-poll that she would count how many how-to-vote cards she gave out and write a report on how many she thought we got for the primary. In all of the decades that Norma conducted this work, she was within plus or minus two per cent of the overall result for the pre-poll. It was extraordinary. In fact, as a new candidate in 2013, when one Norma Hannant gave me a copy of a very detailed report in three giant A4 folders, I was quite astounded at the work that Norma had done and the fact that she was within one per cent for my first election in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Norma was a hard worker for the Liberal National Party. She was a hard worker for the environment, particularly on Fraser Island, which is such a great resource locally for those of us who live in the Wide Bay and for tourists. She will be sadly missed by all of us and her family. Norma Hannant: may she rest in peace. Vale Norma.</span>

Not many people will be aware but in the growth corridor that I represent we have 10,000 children aged three and four, the highest number in the country, for whom this policy announcement is exceptionally good news—that is, over 5,000 four-year-olds who will have guaranteed access to 15 hours of kindergarten under a Labor federal government. Of course, our state Labor government has joined in this commitment to also guarantee kindergarten for three-year-olds in Victoria. This will have an enormous impact in my electorate and it's an enormous spend in my electorate for our great families, many of whom are first-generation Australians with children who are already bilingual. Early learning for those children will be critical to ensure that they reach their capacity through early learning and on to school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with great excitement that I applaud this initiative, but it's also with a sense of sadness that this government has not been able, in its five years, to see sense and reason, and to read the evidence. This government has not even guaranteed universal access for four-year-olds beyond 2019. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my local area, my local government, the Wyndham City Council, has run a nationwide I Love Kinder campaign to raise awareness about the necessity for certainty for local government, private providers and those people providing early learning in our communities. The I Love Kinder campaign has been incredibly successful in raising awareness in other local government areas to ensure that everyone is aware of how important early learning and universal access to it is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on this government to at least match our commitment and give certainty to the sector that they will be funded for universal access for four-year-olds beyond 2019. This government day in, day out this week has talked about certainty. Here's an area where you could give a sector certainty—not any sector; the sector that has in its hands the future of our children. This government needs to get on board, make this commitment, and make it now, so that all kindergartens across Australia know what's coming.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I think I've talked here about my local campaigns to fix the Lindum Station crossing and the Newnham Road-Wecker Road intersection three or four times this year. I'm happy to say that there have been some very good developments with both campaigns since I launched them last year. My petition to fix the Lindum Station crossing has well over 5,000 signatures now; and my petition to fix the Newnham Road-Wecker Road intersection has well over 1,000 signatures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to have the Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population out in Bonner recently to inspect these two black spots. Minister Tudge only had to take one look at the Lindum Station crossing to agree that it's an accident waiting to happen. He acknowledges that it needs fixing, that it has to be done right, with the state Labor government needing to come to the party along with the Brisbane City Council. I'm hopeful that the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads' response will be as positive as my constituents'. The state government cannot pass the buck to the Brisbane City Council. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had a meeting with state member for Lytton, Joan Pease, and I would like to acknowledge her good work in helping to improve the car park at the station and changing the line marking in front of the boom gate. However, the station is still a very dangerous intersection and, with over 1,400 Iona College students needing to cross it every day, a major accident is unfortunately inevitable. I've told Ms Pease that I will seek a federal funding contribution, but it's sad that the buck-passing is continuing. What a shame, but make no mistake: I'll keep fighting for my constituents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I have more encouraging news on the Newnham Road-Wecker Road intersection. Minister Tudge also agrees with me that a fix is needed, and he put the cost at around $12 million. He said that he'll be working with the Brisbane City Council and me to investigate a solution to the intersection. It is one of the five worst intersections in the state, according to the RACQ. </span>

I hope that we continue to talk about preventing discrimination wherever we find it and have a real conversation about all the costs of exclusion in our society and our economy—those which connect to individuals and those which hurt and diminish all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk particularly about age discrimination. I want to talk about Peter, a constituent of mine, who has visited me on a few occasions to discuss his experience of age discrimination in employment. He's in his 60s, some way away from being eligible to receive the age pension. He was made redundant by his former employer and had 18 months before he was eligible to commence receiving Newstart. He spent great amounts of time and energy looking for work and now feels like giving up on that challenge. He tells me his struggle is undoubtedly due to age discrimination. I believe him, because I see plenty of others in exactly his circumstances. He says—and I believe him—that many employers have a poor attitude towards employing older Australians and worry about issues that are exaggerations, stereotypes or myths—like rates of work cover claims, or that older employees will only work in the job for a short period of time and aren't worth the investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not long after I met with Peter recently, ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> report spoke of the fastest growing cohort of people receiving Newstart payments—those over 55 years old. One of the people interviewed in the story said something to Liz that I think sets out the problem experienced by many older Australians. They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I know I've got a lot to offer, I've got a lot of skills and I've worked for a long time, but I think people just think, 'She'll be wanting to retire in a couple of years' time, so it's not worth taking her on'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This anecdotal evidence is backed up by studies and research, including the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Willing to work</span> by the Australian Human Rights Commission, produced two years ago. Amongst the findings include the statistics that the average duration of unemployment for those 55 and over was 68 weeks, compared to 49 weeks for 25- to 54-year-olds and to 30 weeks for those who were younger. This is happening as the percentage of the population over 55 is growing, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mustn't forget the social costs that come with age discrimination and the denial of opportunities to work and participate economically. They are many, but some of the most frequently cited include: impacts on independence, sense of purpose, social connectedness as well as dignity. In addition, there are health impacts, financial consequences, impacts on family and impacts on the networks that older Australians may find themselves becoming ever more reliant on. When an employer turns away a prospective employee who is an older Australian, they're missing out on what are often great credentials: a work history, qualifications, a commitment to the job and to work. People like Peter don't want to give up on finding work. They're looking all over the place to get an opportunity to show how much they have to give to our workforce and to our society. They deserve a better deal.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I rise to congratulate a fabulous school in my electorate of Forde for the terrific work they're doing both in education and vocational training. Beenleigh State High School, led by Principal Matt O'Hanlon, has, amongst its many subject departments, a hospitality and agricultural department. Not too far from the classrooms you'll see the school's farm with chooks, hens, pasture raised pigs, sheep, around 40 Droughtmaster cattle, goats, beehives that provide honey, a strawberry patch and a vegetable garden.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The highlight of the school year for the hospitality and agriculture students has become the paddock to plate luncheon. In 2015, Beenleigh State High hosted its first paddock to plate luncheon with around 80 guests, who dined in the PCYC gym. Since then, things have taken off. On 31 August this year the school hosted its fourth paddock to plate to a sellout crowd of 250 people. Just in case you're not sure, when they say 'paddock to plate', that's exactly what they mean. The school supplied its own beef, pork, lamb, honey, strawberries and kransky sausage for this year's menu. The kransky, with products supplied by the school, was made by Gotzinger Smallgoods down at Ormeau.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paddock to plate is an outstanding team effort led by the head of both hospitality and agriculture, Peta Lenane, with teachers Chelsea Davis and Sarah Te Iwimate working with teacher aide Annette Duffield and agricultural assistant Tim Rowlands, who takes care of the farm and its livestock. Together they provide a level of education and training that's been described as unrivalled in the Queensland system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Internationally-known celebrity chef Matt Golinski also works side by side with his students, sharing his vast experience and standards of excellence in planning and preparing dishes for the event. The paddock to plate luncheon is a major fundraising event for the school's P&amp;C committee, currently ably led by Steve Haase. It provides funds towards student participation in an annual international study tour of Changzhou in China, where they gain invaluable work experience at the internationally recognised Marco Polo hotel. It deserves mention that Dr Jennifer Cronin, the president of Wharf Hotels, which is the owner-operator of the Marco Polo hotels, is herself a 1976 Beenleigh State High School captain. This work done by the school in a whole range of areas is a tremendous testament to everybody involved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  When I open my front door and look out across the fields opposite my house, I get a lovely view of the Olympic Kingsway soccer club. My husband and I were honoured just a few weeks ago to be at the club to celebrate their 65th birthday. The club truly does provide a vital community service. They're truly a community sports club. They represent all parts of our community with social soccer and elite soccer, and they also have bingo and darts. They're now focusing on women's teams, like netball, and supporting more programs for young African soccer players.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was founded in 1953 by Greek immigrants, and they've been playing at the Kingsway sporting complex since 1973. Over the years, the Olympic Kingsway club have nurtured thousands of young aspiring soccer stars, including players who have gone on to play for the Perth Glory. This year, they won the state league division 2 title, having been unbeaten all season. That's a pretty great achievement there. They beat all other teams, including another local team, Wanneroo City, on goal difference. This year, their win marks 40 years since their first win in 1978.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steve Nelkovski became the president in 2016—he and I started our new jobs at the same time—and I've been captured by Steve's passion and his vision for the Olympic Kingsway soccer club, starting a five-year plan to get the club up to National Premier Leagues level in WA. To be eligible to do that, the club has to undergo certain facility upgrades and certain renovations. Just last weekend, I was proud to announce that, if elected, a Labor government would commit $283,000 towards that goal of making Olympic Kingsway soccer club a premiership-level club. A lot of that was due to a petition that many members of the Cowan community signed. And I would like to also express my appreciation for their support in making this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to mention a few very influential and critical people in the history of Olympic Kingsway soccer club, particularly Nick Trandos and the Trandos family, who have devoted generations to making this club and building it up to what it is today. To them, I say congratulations on your win, happy 65th birthday, and thank you for all you do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I would like to bring to the attention of the House the wonderful Dungog Festival, and also congratulate the Dungog community for their wonderful festival, which I attended with my wife, Charlotte. There were many highlights of the Dungog Festival, which ran for several days, and they included a film festival, art shows, the classic long table lunch, which is probably the biggest table lunch in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as many other musical events. But I want to particularly highlight the unique, inaugural and highly successful Sculpture on the Farm event. It was a resounding success due to the hard work of Philippa Graham; her husband, John; and the committee. It was set up as a non-profit entity with a focus on regional tourism—you only need to look at what they have done for Dungog with Sculpture on the Farm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 2,000 people attended their farm at Fosterton, which was opened to display 51 national and international renowned sculptures, both large and small. Some of the pieces you might have seen at events like Sculpture by the Sea. Over time Sculpture on the Farm will increase in its stature, but over 2,000 people turned up. It was a great event for the whole community to help contribute to. The Hilldale Union Church committee catered for the crowd, and they raised funds at the same event. Annabelle Rossini's coffee cart, which supports education for women in Africa, provided coffee refreshments. Dungog Rotary assisted on the gate, and Dungog Rural Fire Service members managed the parking and traffic. So it was an all-of-community event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to personally congratulate Philippa and John Graham. They donated $10,000 for the inaugural prize. The winner was a magnificent piece: Braddon Snape's work 'Nothin' but Sky'. This piece will be donated to the community and placed in a prominent town within the Dungog Shire. The aim of Sculpture on the Farm is to keep raising money and to develop a suite of sculptures to place in all the villages around the Dungog Shire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So put it in your diary for next year—4 to 7 October. The Dungog Festival is for everyone to come and enjoy. And, in the meantime, if you're bored, come up to Dungog on 9 and 10 November for the annual show. Thanks very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Over the next month or so the Parramatta community comes alive with various festivals from the Subcontinent community, the Durga Puja and the Deepavali in particular. The Durga Puja, through the goddess Durga, celebrates the triumph of good over evil and the Deepavali celebrates the victory of righteous over injustice, truth over untruth, and light over darkness. There are many festivals that will come alive in the next month or so. I want to acknowledge just some of them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Federation of Indian Associations of New South Wales will be celebrating Deepavali in the Holroyd Gardens in Merrylands on Sunday, 28 October. I've been to the Federation of Indian Associations' events before, and they're always worth going to. I would like to thank Dr Yadu Singh for the invitation this year once again. The Council of Indian Australians will be holding theirs in Wigram Street, Harris Park, on Saturday, 27 October. We locals refer to Wigram Street as Little India. It's a wonderful place to celebrate all things Subcontinental, and it will be a great event on Saturday, 27 October. I'd like to thank Mohit Kumar for the invitation to that one. The Hindu Council of Australia will be celebrating in Parramatta Park on Sunday, 4 November. Again, it will be a great event and really worth going to. I'd like to thank Prakash Mehta, the national president of the Hindu Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're into Indian food, it's really worth coming along to all of these events to celebrate and to eat the best that we have to offer. The Vakta Mandir Trust will be holding its Durga Puja on 20 October at Northmead high school. It will be a wonderful little event on 20 October. The Australian Bengali Hindu Association have already held their Durga Puja. It was last weekend on 12 October. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend—I missed that one. But, again, it was a great celebration. I've attended many Durga Pujas over time. Thank you, Apu Saha, for the invitation to that. The South Asian Australian Association and Hindi school will be holding theirs on Saturday, 10 November at Parramatta West Public School. The fete will start around 4 pm, and cultural events will go right through into the evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These events, which are celebrated all around the world, which are now very much a part of our community in Parramatta, are always special. This one is known as the Festival of Lights, or Deepavali. It's always special. The community comes out in force in their wonderful saris and their traditional clothing with their traditional foods, and it's well worth everybody coming along to enjoy them. They're part of who we are now. I'm really looking forward to celebrating with my community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  My electorate of Dunkley is a diverse area, around a quarter of which is constituted of young people. These are young people who are the future of Dunkley and whose voices should be heard. As the youngest representative in the government, I'm also keen that their voices are heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that we invest in our youth. It is people such as Frankston Youth Mayor, Gerard Felipe, who are setting the standard. Last week I joined Gerard and a group of local school captains for a question-and-answer forum, where we had the opportunity to open up the conversation and discuss issues and ideas that they deemed critical to their generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to being active in their academic areas of interest, Dunkley's young people are continually demonstrating a desire to participate in sporting endeavours, something for which I have been, and will always be, a strong advocate. The redevelopment of Jubilee Park—for which I originally secured $350,000—under which the plans for the new stadium were developed, has now resulted in over $5.2 million being contributed by the federal government, and also council- and state-level contributions as well. This project will not only promote involvement in physical activity but also encourage current and future young people to continue to be engaged within the community. In addition, the multiple funding grants provided to our local sporting clubs, from junior to senior leagues across a variety of sports, ensure that the opportunity to be involved is presented to all young people across Dunkley regardless of their circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our young people have places to get to, and it is our job to make it as easy as possible for them to get to their universities, TAFEs, jobs and other activities. Transportation is essential for the majority of youth, and there has been a keen interest in increasing accessibility to our local areas. I recently announced that, together with the Liberal state government, we had secured a total of $453 million to meet these exact needs. I must thank in particular Michael Lamb, the Liberal candidate for Frankston; Donna Bauer, the Liberal candidate for Carrum; and Neale Burgess, as well as others, who have brought about this wonderful commitment in conjunction with the budgeted funding from the federal government. The electrification, duplication and extension of the metro rail from Frankston to Baxter will enable our young people to have the flexibility to experience the peninsula and outer regions, create jobs and make their day-to-day commute easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my job as the member for Dunkley to represent the views of our youth and to fight for their needs. I thank my recent work experience student, Alexia Kirkman of Toorak College, for helping me in writing and preparing this speech. I can only continue my work with young people by continuing the dialogue between younger people in my community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AMT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Today I rise to talk about two wonderful people in my community, Trudi and Stephen Hay, who have dedicated so much of their time to helping others through creative and fruitful fundraising efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I attended Trudi Hay's annual high tea at her property in Greenvale, in my electorate. For nine years running Trudi has called on her network of friends and hosted a beautiful sit-down high tea for the purpose of raising money for Northern Health hospital. Each year Trudi and the hospital decide what is the most beneficial piece of equipment needed, and they dedicate their fundraising efforts towards that. This year Trudi raised over $9,000, which will go towards the purchase of a chemotherapy chair and a privacy screen, with a little bit extra left over for the benefit and welfare of breast cancer patients who are being treated there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was 10 years ago when Trudi's friend was diagnosed with breast cancer. She and her friendship group wanted to do all they could to help out their friend. They would take turns cooking meals, taking the kids to different activities and accompanying their friend to chemotherapy treatment. When it was Trudi's turn to take her friend to chemotherapy, she said that she felt helpless. This is what sparked her to contact the fundraising team at Northern Health to do what she could to give back to the community. Trudi turned a tragedy into a positive, and decided she was going to do what she did best—that was to organise and activate a community to get behind an important cause and raise much-needed funds for the health and wellbeing of the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far Trudi's annual fundraisers have raised over $50,000 and have gone to purchasing incredibly important chemotherapy equipment for Northern Health. I'm also happy that her achievements have been recognised by Northern Health. Two years ago Trudi was invited to go on the foundation board as a director and has been there ever since. Together Trudi and her husband, Stephen, have raised well over $300,000 for the hospital and have been instrumental in raising funds for their research centre as well. Trudi says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Both my husband and I have had simple upbringings and through sacrifices and hard work and contacts we are now in a comfortable position. We love to give back, we love our community and we love helping others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stephen, a former real estate agent, was approached to be the auctioneer at Northern Health's annual dinner 20 years ago. He has since been on the board for around 12 years and has developed a robust fundraising approach for Northern Health. One year he used his networks in the building and real estate industry to build an entire house that was auctioned off at one of Northern Health's annual dinners. They've managed to source helicopter rides for auctions, and their creative fundraising ideas and spirits have been of great benefit to Northern Health. Congratulations, Trudi and Stephen Hay.</span>

                  <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I rise to speak about a report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gold Coast Bulletin</span> today which says that the police budget has been slashed for the Gold Coast. Regrettably and unfortunately, this is entirely consistent with the Queensland state Labor government's approach to not providing the necessary resources for the Queensland police to do their job effectively on the Gold Coast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we've seen previously the consequences of Labor's complete mismanagement when it comes to the Queensland economy and the Queensland police. We can only remember, sadly, the unfortunate reputation that the Gold Coast developed a number of years back for being the bikie capital of Australia and the home of organised crime because we had a state Labor government that was soft on crime, was soft on law and order, and didn't provide the necessary resources for the Queensland police to be able to do their job effectively. It took the election of a Liberal-National state government to correct that problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to highlight today that, under this state Labor government doing the very average job that they're doing, we have now seen frontline police struggling. There are now in fact in the City of the Gold Coast—a city of more than 600,000 people—31 fewer frontline police officers under Labor than there were back in 2015 when the Liberal-National Party was in power. Labor are soft on crime. They're soft on law and order. They're denying the Gold Coast the police resources the city needs. And, unfortunately, we are seeing a consequent increase in a whole range of different crimes on the Gold Coast. I say to the state Labor government: pull your socks up. I say to the state Labor government: it's time you actually provided the Queensland police with the resources they need. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Gold Coast Bulletin</span>—and I congratulate them for the work they've done—have the editorial today: 'Ryan treats us like mugs'. It talks about what an average police minister we have in this very average state Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue to be a strong advocate for the Gold Coast, and I say to the state Labor government that they need to do a hell of a lot better than they've been doing so far. This is coming from someone with a strong track record of investing in law and order on the Gold Coast. We saw the former federal Labor government rip police resources out of the Gold Coast when they shut down the AFP office. I brought it back. I fought for it for the city. The fact is that we delivered the first strike force on the Gold Coast. We brought back the AFP and got rid of the bikies, and I say to the state Labor government that they need to do a hell of a lot better to improve police resources on the Gold Coast. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're bringing the city and country together with this project. The project is to recognise the fact that for the last 150 years there's been a strong Chinese presence in the bush. In fact, this is going back to the Amoy shepherd's, who came to Queensland back in the 1860s. Many went to the Darling Downs and looked after the flocks on the Darling Downs. They came from Amoy, which is now Xiamen in southern China. Many experienced hardship. Many of them did not find a life of great wealth. Some came a bit later for the goldfields but actually found wealth in businesses and the like. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was told by the former Mayor of St George Robert Buchan that many of their grave markers were burnt down in the 1970s, when a grass fire got out of control. I came up with this project, working with Richard Marsh, the current mayor of Balonne Shire, and Minister Littleproud. We had a design competition, which was won by an Indigenous year 7 student, Daisy Brown. She's got this wonderful design showing the local Indigenous Kamilaroi welcoming the Chinese settlers to the area. We then had the first sod turned on 7 April. On 11 October this year the memorial designed by Daisy Brown, Lewis Lee and the committee under the stewardship of Jack Sun—a wonderful committee—was completed. It was built by Wing Hing Construction under the stewardship of Kwong Wha Tse and local builders in St George. We've got a great memorial. We'll hopefully be having an opening in February next year. On that day, I look forward to seeing people like Wayne Long—who's a good friend of mine, a guy who I went to school with. His is an Indigenous Chinese story, as there often is in the bush, where the Chinese community had relationships with the Indigenous community. Now there's that long history—no pun intended—for people like Wayne Long, where they've got an Indigenous background going back 60,000 years and also a strong connection with the middle kingdom and China. This is a wonderful connection between the bush and the city. I look forward to being at the opening with Minister Littleproud in February next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services, Housing and Disability Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I rise to raise concern about Telstra's plan to construct a mobile base station tower in Torquay at the Quay Reserve. This must be moved to a more appropriate location. This tower, in such a special green reserve, such an important recreation area, would be an absolute eyesore. Last week I met with residents who formed the group Save our Quay, and this week, in Parliament House, I met with senior management from Telstra and urged them to relocate the tower. I'm also calling on Surf Coast Shire, including my Labor opponent, who is a councillor, to refuse Telstra's planning permit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, once again, we see Libby Coker terribly conflicted in her dual roles as councillor and candidate. This demonstrates, again, that she's not prepared to put the people of Corangamite first. If she was truly committed to the people coming Corangamite, she would have stood down from council. She would have done the right thing, as Brian McKiterick, the Liberal Party's first-class candidate for the seat of Bellarine, has done. Brian is making fantastic inroads in his campaign against a very poor Labor member, Lisa Neville. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that Libby Coker has been a very poor representative. She initially backed a council plan to destroy the Anglesea Bike Park and build the Messmate Track bypass. She wants to destroy the town boundary in Anglesea. Development is out of control in many parts of the shire, particularly in Torquay. Of course, as everyone knows, she has turned her back on thousands of families who are desperate for a pool in Torquay—a pool which is vital for swimming safety, particularly for young children, as well as for wellbeing, health and tourism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the people of Corangamite will not forget how she has now abandoned them over the city deal. She stood with the member for Corio and Daniel Andrews several weeks ago, announcing $150 million for some very good projects in both the electorate of Corio and Wannon but, would you believe, not a cent of direct investment for Corangamite. This candidate has shown no capacity to stand up to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Corio and to fight for Corangamite over such an important deal. Frankly, that is not good enough. I'm very proud to be working hard to ensure that Corangamite gets its fair share of investment from the city deal and I will obviously continue to work very hard on that project until we announce it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to a great Australian, Mr Ian Kiernan AO. Mr Kiernan was born in Sydney on Friday, 4 October 1940. He was educated at the Scots College in Sydney, The Armidale School in northern New South Wales and the Sydney Technical College. Ian went on to join the construction industry. He specialised in historic restorations. Throughout his life, Ian was a passionate yachtsman, sailing competitively for more than four decades. In 1986-87, Ian represented Australia in the BOC Challenge, a solo around-the-world yacht race. He finished sixth out of a fleet of 25 yachts from 11 different nations. He set during that journey an Australian record for a solo circumnavigation of the world. His yacht was named <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of Sydney</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was during this race that Ian Kiernan saw the amount of rubbish which was choking the world's oceans. After he returned to Sydney, he organised a community event which began with just the support of a few friends: Clean Up Sydney Harbour on Sunday, 8 January 1989. When I say 'just a few of his friends', 40,000 volunteers showed up. Ian was a guy who, when you met him, was charismatic. He was warm, he was engaging and he was a leader of men and women. He was a leader of his community. That day, they collected 5,000 tonnes of rubbish. Based on the success of this event, Clean Up Australia Day took place the following year. It has since then taken place on the first Sunday of March every year, with more than 300,000 Australians volunteering their time to make a difference to their local environment. In my electorate of Grayndler, every year, the big clean-up day usually focuses on Cooks River. Now, with the expansion of my electorate to the north, Sydney Harbour is also a focus—around Balmain, White Bay and the foreshores of the harbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1991, Ian decided that, since Clean Up Sydney Harbour had moved to Clean Up Australia, he wanted to start Clean Up the World. In its first year, more than 30 million people—more than the population of Australia—from 80 countries participated. It has since grown to involve over 40 million people from 120 countries. Ian was the chair of Clean Up Australia, a national non-profit organisation that coordinates not just Clean Up Australia but also Clean Up the World. Clean Up Australia also runs Clean Up Australia projects, which are long-term community based environmental programs that address the need for ongoing care and restoration of environmental assets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian was named Australian of the Year in 1994 and received numerous Australian and international awards—but he didn't ask for any of them. He was a very humble man. I was privileged to have contact with him on a number of occasions. He was someone who was very passionate about making a difference. Ian Kiernan's life shows that an individual can make a very, very big difference to their local community, the city in which they live, the nation and indeed the world. He and his wife, Judy, had two daughters, Sally and Pip, and a son, Jack. I pay my respects to all of the family members and to all those who will miss Ian Kiernan dearly.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian Kiernan is appropriately revered by Australians from all walks of life in every part of our continent, but it's fair to say that he had a special place in the hearts of residents in my own electorate of North Sydney. I say that for two reasons. Firstly, Ian was a longstanding resident of Kirribilli, in the North Sydney electorate, and was well known as one of our great local identities. But, just as importantly, Ian's great passion, which started that movement which was to become the focus of his life, began in his love and respect for Sydney Harbour and its natural environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard, Ian started his life as a builder. His other great passion was as a yachtsman. That passion took him around the world, particularly as a solo sailor, but it also took him on six occasions to Hobart as part of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. The experience of being a yachtsman sailing the world's great oceans and seas helped reinforce Ian's passion for our incredible marine environment, but it also helped reinforce his passion for doing something to protect that environment. During those sailing races he discovered that great scourge, even back then, which has only become worse in the period since, that is the impact of pollution and waste on our marine environment. When he returned to Sydney after one of those races, he was determined not simply to sit by and wonder idly whether something could be done. He determined that something would be done, and he would help lead the movement to do that. In 1989 he started that process with what was meant to be a small event about protecting and improving the beaches around his own then suburb of Mosman, so he planned a 'clean-up Mosman' day. But such was the enthusiasm of Sydneysiders for this initiative that it quickly became apparent that there wasn't enough waste even in Mosman that the 40,000 volunteers he'd amassed would be needed for. So, overnight, Clean Up Mosman became Clean Up Sydney Harbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sydneysiders and all Australians were captivated by the motivation that he provided, and just a year later Clean Up Australia was born, with 40,000 volunteers. As part of that, Clean Up Australia and Ian created one of those advertising jingles that stick in the mind, like many of the greats, and 'yucky, yucky, poo' became part of the Australian lexicon. I'll spare the Federation Chamber my attempt at a rendition of it today, but needless to say it is one of those jingles that have stuck in the mind of so many Australians ever since. From 40,000 to 300,000 and then, a couple of years later, to the 30 million people who joined in Clean Up the World, which was his so-successful attempt to take his campaign global. Ian's contribution was recognised very quickly, and in 1994 he became Australian of the Year. What a fitting tribute to his work that was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian's contribution was really one that changed the mindset of a generation about our individual capacity to act to protect our own environment. It's fair to say that when Ian started his crusade to reduce the impact of waste and pollution, the marine environment around Sydney in particular was different to what it is today. All of us remember vividly the campaigns to try and eliminate the discharge of raw sewage into the ocean just off our magnificent world famous beaches, and it's fair to say that litter and waste affected beaches and waterways around Sydney. In fact, it was a brave person who dived into the waters off most Sydney Harbour beaches back in those days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He did teach us that we could act as individuals, and he really led a people power movement to improve our environment. What Clean Up Australia—and Clean Up the World—did was remind us that our own actions, which seem small and inconsequential in isolation, when combined together can create problems but we can be part of solving those problems, as mighty as they might have seemed to Australians at the time. Ian really motivated a generation. We have seen millions of Australians join together to try and improve our environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as I alluded to, the problems he identified exist today and, frankly, despite all of his efforts, have grown worse. I hope that the legacy of Ian's life is that we all renew our resolve to act both within our own borders and, more importantly, globally to try and reduce the impact of pollution, particularly plastics, on our marine environment. We know that this is a growing problem, and we know it's particularly a problem in our own region, because so much of the plastic pollution entering our oceans is doing so from nations and river systems in South-East Asia. We've seen the consequences of that on the incredible marine ecology of the oceans that border Australia—the Indian and, particularly, the Pacific. There are now estimates that by 2050 the weight of plastic pollution will exceed that of all marine life, and we know that we have an enormous task ahead of us. I hope, as we reflect on Ian's incredible life, that we do renew our commitment as Australians, and as world citizens, to make sure his goal that we tread lightly on this incredible planet of ours is one that comes to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to Ian Kiernan, and I particularly want to extend my condolences to his family: Judy, Sally and Pip. I know that they will have some consolation from the recognition Ian's work has been receiving over the last two days, although obviously nothing will take away from the extraordinary personal loss they are feeling this week.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  This week, sadly, Australia lost an amazing human icon. We lost someone who, in the face of adversity, saw an opportunity to make a huge difference in our world. We lost a man who valued our environment. From his single-mindedness he had a huge impact on our nation and globally in terms of protecting our environment. It would be hard to imagine that there would be an Australian who hasn't participated in Clean Up Australia. If you ask anyone under the age of 28, they probably remember picking up rubbish in the schoolyard every year for Clean Up Australia Day. Certainly my children and my grandchildren are very aware of what Clean Up Australia Day means to our local community in Townsville. They have all participated in school related activities, which means they are very aware of looking after our environment. They have, as we all have, learned of the importance of valuing and looking after our local communities. Two of my grandchildren are of Norwegian descent, and they are particularly aware of getting rid of rubbish properly, and they have grown up within a recycling regime. Mr Kiernan's environmental work didn't just get thousands of schoolkids trawling the playground for plastic wrap and empty juice poppers every day; it has also had a lasting impact on how Australians view rubbish and how we care for our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian Kiernan was born on 4 October 1940. He grew up around Sydney's harbours and beaches, where he learnt to swim, fish and sail. Educated at The Scots College and The Armidale School in northern New South Wales, he went on to work in the construction industry, specialising in historic restorations. But it was his love of sailing that led to his remarkable career as a global environmentalist, founder of Clean Up Australia and Clean Up the World campaigns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1986, the then 44-year-old represented Australia in the BOC solo around-the-world yacht race. He finished sixth out of a fleet of 25 yachts from 11 nations, but set an Australian record for a solo circumnavigation of the world. During his nine months at sea, Kiernan was appalled by the amount of rubbish he saw choking the world's oceans. On his return he set out to do something about it, and, with the support of his friends, organised the community event Clean Up Sydney Harbour on Sunday, 8 January 1989. It was a huge success, with more than 40,000 volunteers lending a hand. The next year, the first Clean Up Australia Day took place, with more than 300,000 Australians volunteering their time to pick up rubbish and help make a difference to the health of their local environments. In 1991, Kiernan started Clean Up the World. In its first year more than 30 million people from 80 countries participated. It has since grown to involve over 40 million people from 120 countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1994 Kiernan rushed to protect Prince Charles after a man with a starting pistol stormed the stage at an Australia Day event at Sydney's Darling Harbour. After the royal assassin was taken away the Prince continued with his role in the event and Kiernan was awarded Australian of the Year. Mr Kiernan received numerous awards recognising his dedication to end pollution and promote environmentalism. Mr Kiernan received the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1991, the United Nations Global 500 award for the environment in 1993, the Officer of the Order of Australia in 1995, the World Citizenship Award 1999 and the Centenary Medal in 2001. And although these awards are noble, the greatest award is the change that Mr Kiernan has made for the environment and in the attitudes and minds of many Australians in protecting and looking after our precious environment. The legacy he has left should be a reminder to those in this place. It is especially timely given the LNP government's rejection of the IPCC report. Although Mr Kiernan's legacy was huge, his advice was always simple:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Simple, easy actions can protect the health of our water resources and help save drinking water supplies. There is not one individual who cannot help to make a difference to the health of the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Mr Kiernan for his years of dedication. My thoughts are with his family: his wife, Judy, and his two daughters, Sally and Pip.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Two weeks ago I attended an event in Byron Bay in support of Asren Pugh, the Labor candidate for Ballina. There I met a remarkable man, Neville Kelly. He's a life member of the Australian Labor Party. He'd been a member for more than 50 years. I spent some time talking to Ned, as he is known. He told me a story about his involvement in politics and how he came to be engaged, particularly in areas of country New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1961, Ned moved to Moree. As a member of the local health board, he was appointed by the then minister, Billy Sheehan, to the district hospital board as a director. He went around the hospital to get familiar with it and, as he thought he had seen everything in the hospital, he asked what this shed was a few hundred metres down from the hospital. He'd seen food going to and from that area. He was told that was where the Aboriginals were. The Aboriginal patients were kept in a separate area with inferior food and inferior conditions in 1961.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ned is a very sprightly gentleman. He told me the story about how he fixed it. He got Billy Sheehan to come up as a minister to open a section of the new hospital. He told Billy Sheehan what the circumstances were in Moree, and Billy Sheehan the day before, of course, said that he would come on the condition that everyone was treated equally. From that day of the minister's visit, segregation ended. But it didn't end in other parts of the Moree area, and this wasn't unfamiliar in other parts of Australia as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Moree Plains Shire Council had carried a resolution in 1955, and that resolution said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Which was the local swimming pool. What we saw in the 1960s was the freedom riders that changed that. I seek leave to table, and I thank those opposite for allowing it, an article from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mirror</span> on 21 February 1965, 'Violence explodes in racist town'. It begins:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that Jim Spigelman and Charlie Perkins did on those freedom rides is very well-known, but it was people in rural areas who made such a big difference. They had a public meeting at the town hall. Ned went along to that public meeting and moved a resolution that council open up all facilities—the town hall, the swimming pool and, of course, the famous spa there at Moree—which weren't allowed to be used by Aboriginals in that town. What he did then, as the elections were coming up, was he stood and got elected. He came first in being elected to Moree council, showing that beneath the surface the population actually knew it was wrong and were prepared to vote for change. At his first council meeting, he moved just that change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ned is an example of a true believer in the Australian Labor Party—a bloke who has never run for any office other than local council, who's given up more than five decades of his life and who's made a real impact. I'm sure there are many people across the political spectrum who do that, and I pay tribute to Ned today and all those who don't get to be members of parliament but who make a difference to their local communities and to their nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  It certainly has been a busy few weeks for sporting clubs in my electorate of Boothby as many celebrate the end of their winter season and many start their summer season. Last month, I was delighted to attend the Sturt Lions Football Club MiniRoos presentation morning with my state colleague Steve Murray MP. The players, aged between six and 11 years, were presented with trophies to celebrate a successful season, and they farewelled the players moving into the junior division next season. It was wonderful to be able to personally thank the club president, John Vander Veeken, and all of the parents, volunteers and supporters for encouraging this very enthusiastic group of young players.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the very real and pressing need to provide the Sturt Lions Football Club with facilities to support their very large number of young athletes, particularly with the significant growth in participation that the club has seen over the past few years. I will be working very hard with my state colleagues Sam Duluk MP and Steve Murray MP to ensure that the Sturt Lions have the facilities that they require to support their continued growth and success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fantastic football club in my community, the Cumberland United Women's Football Club, also celebrated a very successful season at their recent presentation dinner. It was a wonderful evening with the club's president John Hood, the fabulous Patrick Weatherill, the committee, players and families. Special congratulations to Sian and Ben Williams on a great event with some of the most amazing decorations that I've seen, and congratulations to Sam Jones for being awarded Volunteer of the Year. As one of the first women-only soccer clubs in South Australia, Cumberland is leading the way in fostering female participation in the game and is providing a strong development path for young girls wanting to play soccer. I'm delighted the South Australian Marshall Liberal government will deliver the funding committed to upgrade the Women's Memorial Playing Fields, which are home to the Cumberland United Women's Football Club, so that they finally have the sporting facilities that they need and deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019 the Brighton Bowling Club will celebrate their centennial year. They started their celebrations with a wonderful season-opening dinner which I attended with my state colleague Corey Wingard MP, who is also the Minister for Sport. It's quite a remarkable achievement and a credit to the club to have reached this milestone. Special thanks to President Darrell Fishpool; Secretary John Kirby, who was recently appointed a life member of the club; Treasurer Linda Kirby; and all of the members of the committee for inviting us along to their opening night. I'm confident that the 2018-19 season will be as successful as the past 99 seasons, and I look forward to recognising this milestone and celebrating with the club over coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, as you would appreciate, Brighton is also home to the wonderful Brighton and Seacliff Yacht Club. Over the past few years, I have been fortunate to attend the club's season-opening, and once again this year it attracted a huge crowd. It is always a pleasure to catch up with Commodore Robert Turton, his committee and all the members who are in attendance. Earlier this week I spoke about the incredible and very talented young sailors who are members of the club but also students at Westminster who recently won the Interdominion championship in New Zealand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not far away, the Brighton Tennis Club also celebrated the start of the 2018-19 season. Their season-opening was the 115th in a row, which I think you would agree is a remarkable achievement for any club. The occasion also provided an opportunity to celebrate some individual membership milestones, including 25, 30, 40 and 50-plus years of continuous membership. Particular congratulations to Geoffrey Trowbridge, who celebrated over 60 years of continuous membership at the Brighton Tennis Club. It's an outstanding achievement, and I'm sure that Geoff will be well rewarded with another spectacular season this year. Special thanks to President Rob Hill and all of the club members who were in attendance at the season-opening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker—and you will really appreciate this one—it was an absolute pleasure to attend the season-opening of the Somerton Yacht Club to toast the start of their sailing season. I joined Commodore Jacqui Cole, committee and club members as well as representatives from the City of Holdfast Bay—the Acting Mayor, Amanda Wilson, and Councillors Karen Donaldson and Mikki Bouchee—for the christening of several new boats and to hear about the exciting season ahead. We just hope that they have more wind than they did on the season-opening. It was a very still day, so there was more paddling than sailing done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  Last week I visited the Blue Sky Community Group in my electorate of Cowan. Blue Sky provides financial counselling services for people, many of whom have found themselves in untenable positions of accrued debt and are facing financial hardship. I met one of their clients, who, after a severe illness, could no longer work in her once-lucrative position. She lost her house and had to rely on welfare and housing assistance. But she also found herself with $38,000 of credit card debt. Much of the responsibility for that falls on the unscrupulous banks and credit providers that continued to offer her more and more credit, at high interest rates and with high penalties for late payments, even as she struggled to afford the most basic repayments. Eventually she went to Blue Sky, and the financial counsellor there was able to help her manage her repayments and get some of that debt waived. Essentially, they saved her life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to the counsellors at Blue Sky about the growing need for their services, particularly in Western Australia and within Cowan. There has been a huge spike of people in Cowan who are suffering mortgage stress. The end of the mining and construction boom in WA saw thousands of people retrenched and unable to find work. Men, women and families who bought homes at the peak of the boom, when house prices were at an all-time high, are now left in a situation where they have unmanageable mortgages, but they're also unable to sell their homes at a price that would even begin to cover the mortgage debt that they find themselves in, because house prices in WA have fallen so much. They bought their houses to fulfil that great Australian dream of home ownership. They are the aspirational Aussies that this government likes to talk about. They worked hard, they paid their taxes and they did everything they could to contribute to and participate in the economic and social fabric of this country. But they're also the people that this government has forgotten in its pandering to big business and the top end of town. I cannot stress enough to this House just how important these kinds of services are, particularly at a time when we are seeing stagnant wage growth, increasing cost of living, job losses, casualisation of the workforce and the loss of penalty rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally important is the service provided by community legal centres across Australia. Today there's a delegation of senior staff from CLCs visiting Parliament House. They include representatives from women's legal services, employment law centres, generalist community centres, those with health justice partnerships, specialist domestic violence units, those with elder abuse expertise and those from regional areas. These centres provide a vital service and support to people experiencing family violence in areas including housing and tenancy, social security, financial matters and credit debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of a statistic: in WA there are 28 centres, and last year they helped 22,759 people with funding of just over $6 million. The Women's Law Centre tells me that relationship breakdown due to financial stress has increased the demand for the services of community legal services there. The Employment Law Centre is telling me that there is an influx of people around employment law and entitlements but also that the increase in a casualised workforce, and more long-term unemployed mid-level engineers and managers, et cetera, is also due to the end of the mining construction boom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These centres support particular groups within the community: women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. They work to help everyday people with everyday legal problems in pretty much every state and territory in Australia. But this vital service is under threat, because of no funding certainty for the community legal sector. This impacts on their ability to provide a service that meets a growing need, and, in practice, results in a service lag. Last year 97 CLCs spent over 3,857 hours per week on funding related activities. Again, I cannot stress enough to this House the vital importance of these kinds of services for our community to ensure that no Australian is left behind. We can talk about economic growth all we like, but we need to ensure that all people have access to that economic growth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  I rise to ask for the Federation Chamber's support for our local potential Invictus Games champion, Daniel 'Stix' Parker. Stix has got an absolutely incredible story. In his own words, Stix says that he has had more surgeries than birthdays, at just 29 years of age. He has had bilateral surgeries on his knees and ankles, he has pins in his hips and he has a battery pack for his spine, but he has a 'go get 'em' attitude, I have to tell you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Stix last week in Hervey Bay with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Darren Chester. He's also known for a very interesting fact—that is, he is the youngest member of the executive of an RSL sub-branch in the entire country, the Toogoom RSL sub-branch. I think that's an incredible achievement for someone who has served our country and is so very passionate about continuing to give back. He also suffers from PTSD but he's a very down-to-earth young man, who is competing, I'm advised, in the 100 metres, the 200 metres, the 400 metres, the long jump and the relay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might not know it, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, but I once used to be involved with things that were a little bit athletic. I wasn't that good at it, but I know a little bit about it. I said to Stix: 'Are you doing a crouch start or a standing start?' He said: 'Mate, I always do a standing start. If I go to a crouch start it has the potential to pull the wires out of my spine.' This is a gentleman who, I've got to say, has got some serious wheels. His time for the hundred, hand timed, is 12.2 seconds. That is a very, very serious athlete. We expect that he is going to go very well. In fact, I'd compare him to Damian Drum's horse in the Caulfield Cup on Saturday, but I think Stix is a much better chance. If you want to get out there and get your hard-earned on someone, it is Stix Parker. He is a real chance for a gold in the Invictus Games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a more serious note for the games, Stix tells me he's already met His Royal Highness Prince Harry—he met him at a previous games, in 2017—and he had a very good conversation with him. In fact, he provided him with a wood-turned pen, a wooden pen, which he put together. One of those things that Stix does with his PTSD, in his own words once again, when things get him down, when it gets a bit tough, is turn things on a wood lathe. So he produced a pen, which he's given to His Royal Highness Prince Harry, and I'm sure that is something he'll raise with him again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is also husband to a beautiful wife and a good role model for his children. He applied for the Invictus Games in 2018 to show that, no matter what games we play in our heads, they are just that—games. We can overcome them through sport or by reaching out to a fellow mate. We would say to all of our veterans: here is an opportunity, because for Stix sport is what gets him out of the house and off the couch. I think that is a great lesson to all of our youth. No matter what the difficulties are in your own life there is an opportunity in sport to get yourself involved and get active.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our local veterans are a very strong group. There are approximately 4,000 veterans in Hinkler. At the Toogoom sub-branch, of which Stix is a member of the executive, they have one of the first Vietnam-era sheds that were distributed by the federal government. They have done an incredible job with something that, according to His Excellency Peter Cosgrove, was designed to withstand mortars. The shed has been converted into a wet bar, storage, showers and toilets, and media rooms and facilities. I've been there a number of times. It is a class act, and they have worked incredibly hard to put this together. The Toogoom RSL sub-branch started from very humble beginnings. They now have this Vietnam-era shed. They also have an APC, with support from the federal government. One of the Vietnam-era APCs is available for viewing at Toogoom RSL sub-branch, a small community in my electorate right down on the water between Burrum Heads and Hervey Bay. It is part of the proposed military trail from Hervey Bay to Maryborough in the electorate of Wide Bay and, of course, at Toogoom. There are real opportunities for tourism and to demonstrate how committed we are to our veterans and those who have served.</span>

He will be living up to his own motto: 'challenge accepted'. It is good to see that sport is working so well, helping our veterans who struggle on return from their service to our nation. Congratulations to Stix. Mate, go well. We look forward to your coming home to town with your gold medal—if not one, then two, three or four.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  We spend a lot of time talking in this place, and most of us don't seem to mind that too much—in fact, some of us clearly love the sound of our own voices. But not everyone is as comfortable with public speaking as the average politician, and I want to talk about the work of Toastmasters in my electorate of Macquarie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that fear of public speaking is up there in the top fears people express, although one American researcher has found that since Donald Trump became President, it's been pushed down to No. 52, with fear of mass shootings now at No. 35. I know from my days as a trainer that the fear of speaking can impact on people's careers, and, at the very least, ruin their enjoyment of sharing their knowledge. That's where Toastmasters—volunteer run—is doing great work building people's skills and confidence in standing up and speaking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My experience of visiting Toastmasters is that our groups—under the regional leadership of people like Louise McMahon in the Hawkesbury, who was kind enough to invite me to the Toastmasters meetings that she was overseeing when she was president of Hawkesbury, and Heike Tye in the Blue Mountains—are very supportive environments to make mistakes. They're working hard to make sure that it's okay to not be perfect. I'd like particularly to note John Wayland, whose ability to entertain us on the subject of nothing is legendary. The sense of support that comes from Toastmasters comes from every single member of the groups that I've had contact with, from Hawkesbury Valley to Springwood and Glenbrook to Katoomba. They all know they can work together more effectively than struggling on their own. Congratulations to them all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It probably needed the skills of a former police investigator to get to the bottom of the mystery of Frederick Whirlpool, the first person in Australian uniform to be presented with the Victoria Cross. His medal hangs in the Australian War Memorial, but his name wasn't really Whirlpool. We now know a lot more about him thanks to former police officer and former art gallery director, now turned historian and writer, Alan Leek, whose book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Frederick Whirlpool: Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">idden Victoria Cross</span>, I had the pleasure of launching at the Hawkesbury museum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whirlpool's links with the Hawkesbury are strong. He moved to Victoria in 1859 but then found the Hawkesbury, hiding his past and some of his demons, and, with those, he hid the story of how he came to be awarded the VC. Humphrey James was his real name, and he was awarded the VC for services during the 1857-58 Indian mutiny, where he suffered 17 severe sword wounds that ended his military career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm always fascinated by the stories behind the soldiers who serve in battles and events not of their own making. This era of colonisation by the British took their soldiers around the globe. It was the peak of the East India Company, formed in 1600 for the exploitation of trade with East and South-East Asia and India. The Indian mutiny led to the dissolution of the East India Company and forced the British to reorganise the army, the financial system and the administration in India. It resulted in India being administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj for nearly 100 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My point is that this was a time of tumultuous change in parts of the world, and there is so much that we don't know about the lives of the individual men who were part of that time. That's why I say that true investigative skills were needed to reveal the details of Whirlpool's life. Alan Leek honed his skills during his years in the New South Wales Police Force, including leading the investigation into Australia's first political assassination. Whirlpool was presented with his VC by Lady Barkly, the then Victorian governor's wife, when he was a member of the Hawthorn and Kew Volunteer Rifles. His grave, though, now lies in South Windsor, in my electorate, unmarked and neglected. I'm hoping to find a way to fix that and ensure that the Hawkesbury can provide appropriate recognition for a VC awardee, the first to be presented their award publicly in Australia and the first to someone wearing an Australian uniform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thompson Square is the oldest square in the country and is being dug up and destroyed to make way for a replacement Windsor Bridge. Around a hundred Hawkesbury residents gathered to discuss what changes need to happen to protect and preserve the ever-declining heritage we have in New South Wales. I've put on the record many times my dismay and horror at the willingness of the New South Wales government to override its own heritage advice and the findings of an upper house inquiry and the request of every heritage group, including the National Trust, and its willingness to ignore the request of the former federal environment minister to reconsider the project on heritage grounds. I want to thank shadow New South Wales heritage minister, Penny Sharpe, and shadow minister for local government, Peter Primrose, and Labor's Hawkesbury candidate, Pete Reynolds, for taking part in this important forum.</span>
