                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator ABETZ:</span>
                  </a>  Australia was shaken last week when one of our fine young sportsmen was injured in tragic circumstances on the field and later succumbed to his injuries. He would have turned 26 last Sunday. Today, in Macksville, his family and friends are gathering to farewell Phillip Joel Hughes. His death in such a public manner, pursuing our national game, has affected many, many Australians and many others abroad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Hughes showed his talent on the pitch at a very young age. He played at club and state level and then, aged just 20, received his Australian baggy green. He played for two states, New South Wales and South Australia; he played in the Indian Premier league; and he played for three English county sides, Middlesex, Hampshire and Worcestershire. Phillip Hughes was the youngest player to score twin centuries in a test, before his 21st birthday. He scored a century on his county debut at Lord's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reaction to his death has been spontaneous and heartfelt. Phillip Hughes was not only a remarkable cricketer but, by all reports, a modest and engaging young man. The regard in which he was held has been echoed by his team mates and those he played against both in Australia and across the globe. The circumstances of the injury which led to his death are simply tragically unfortunate. No blame or fault can be laid at the feet of the bowler. Indeed, our thoughts and prayers reach out to the bowler, who was doing nothing other than his professional best. Expert medical commentators have stated how the chance of an injury of this nature having this devastating effect was so remote as to be unforeseeable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been said, in the midst of life we are in death. We express our deepest sympathy to his family on the death of their beloved son. We think of his teammates, who are grappling with the removal from their midst of a gentle, kind young Australian man who loved the country and who had prodigious natural talent. Of all the heart-rending tributes we have seen over the last few days, for me the most moving was from a lady who lives in Macksville and saw him grow up. She said, with poignant simplicity, 'He was a lovely young man.' On behalf of the government, I extend sympathy to the family of Phillip Joel Hughes. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  <a href="5K4" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FAULKNER:</span>
                  </a>  I thank the Senate and I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to speak on their behalf. Phillip Joel Hughes was a cricketer from humble origins with an unorthodox batting technique but a prodigious talent. He reminded us of a time when sport was less professional, less formulaic than it is today. It is perhaps why his career was so exhilarating. It is perhaps why his death is so sobering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Hughes grew up on a banana plantation in the tiny town of Macksville on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Country New South Wales has produced and nurtured many fine cricketers, like Charlie Turner of Bathurst, Don Bradman of Bowral, Stan McCabe of Grenfell, Bill O'Reilly of Wingello, and Arthur Morris and Dougie Walters, both from Dungog; from another generation, the products of Wagga Wagga, Geoff Lawson, Mark Taylor and Michael Slater; and, more recently again, another North Coast of New South Wales lad, Adam Gilchrist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in Macksville that Phillip Hughes developed his unorthodox approach to batting, playing against his brother in the backyard. Then, and until last Thursday, perhaps to the purist he never quite looked the part. Where most batsmen step across the crease, weight forward, Phillip Hughes would step towards square leg and look to play through the offside. It is said that his onside shots were blocked by the side of the family home, perhaps the reason he was so renowned for his offside play. Maybe the purists were right—his batting was not from the textbook—but he could play. He could really play. You might question the method, but never the result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Hughes was playing adult cricket by the age of 12, and aged just 17 he moved to Sydney to play grade for Western Suburbs. He scored 141 on debut, and so word spread about a country boy with a unique style, scoring big in grade cricket, and that word was heard. Selectors took a look for themselves. A year later, aged just 18, Phillip Hughes was selected to play for New South Wales, where, once more, the talent and temperament overcame tradition and technique. He scored 559 runs at an average of 62.11 for New South Wales in his debut season. He became the second fastest player in New South Wales to score 1,500 in first-class cricket—the fastest was Donald Bradman, a boy from Bowral. At 19, he was the youngest player to make a century in a Sheffield Shield final. A place in the national side beckoned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, Phillip Hughes got his break. He was selected to tour South Africa. Against the fierce pace bowling of Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn, he initially faltered, out for a duck in the first innings of the first test, playing an outrageous shot to a short-pitched delivery. He recovered with a steady knock of 75 runs in the second innings. But, in the second test of that tour, in Durban, he emphatically answered those who wondered whether test cricket was beyond him, by scoring a century into each innings, the youngest man ever to do so. There was a refreshing audacity and vitality to a player barely out of his teens against what was then the best bowling attack in the world, boldly hitting successive sixes to bring up a maiden test century. He scored 115 in the first innings and 160 in the second, helping Australia to an unlikely series victory. In the afterglow of those sparkling innings, Peter Roebuck wrote: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He can defend and he can lash. He is going to score buckets. He has figured out the odds, knows the angles, trusts his eye and likes batting. His technique may be homespun but that does not mean it does not work. He has fast eyes, feet and wits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These were thrilling innings, full of promise, but a less successful Ashes campaign was to follow, where, in the dim light of a northern summer, the English bowlers targeted Phillip Hughes with short-pitched bowling. He spent the next five years in and out of the test side. There were brief hints of brilliance, portents of what many thought would be a long career: a dazzling debut century in a one-day match, a patient hundred against Sri Lanka away from home, a dogged and mature last-wicket stand in Trent Bridge—an epic that turned the match on its head. But he was inconsistent, and at each missed step he was asked to return to Shield cricket to work on his technique and make runs, and each time he did so, patiently and graciously, never envious of the success of others. After all, he was a young man; there was plenty of time. Many thought that Phillip Hughes's patience, grace and talent would be rewarded this very week with a recall to the test side. His death last week reminds us all of our own mortality—how uncertain and tenuous our grip on life can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot pretend to have known Phillip Hughes well, having only had one substantial conversation with him, when he came to Reg Bartley Oval in Rushcutters Bay to give of his time and his support to the cricket charity the LBW Trust. I know many who did know him well, and they all say that he was modest, courteous, with no airs and graces—still very much the kid who made the big time and could not quite believe it. Phillip Hughes was a cricketer of immense talent, but, perhaps of greater importance, he was a fine young man. He denied no youngster his advice or his time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a family, as friends, as teammates, as the cricket community and as the nation mourn the loss of Phillip Hughes, our thoughts also turn to Sean Abbott and the terrible aberration and impact of just another of the countless balls he would have bowled over many years of practice and play. Of course there was no ill motivation but sheer, sheer, awful bad luck. My hope is that Sean—with the support of friends, family and the cricket community—will continue to play and prosper in cricket at the highest levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, at best, a bitter consolation that Phillip Hughes died doing what he loved, but it is some consolation. He was 25 years old. He was 63 not out. The scorebook will show he will remain forever 63 not out. The outpouring of grief of his passing is a matter I have not previously witnessed for any other sportsman. It will be apparent to all in this chamber that the death of this young man has reached beyond that moment at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and has reached well beyond cricket. In part, this is because of the quality of the overwhelmingly sensitive and appropriate coverage by the Australian media of this terrible tragedy. I acknowledge the respect that they have shown. I also acknowledge the Australian cricket team and Cricket Australia. They have been magnificent in the most difficult of circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You do not have to have known Phillip Hughes to have shed tears. I know of many who have wept at the sheer unfairness of his passing. Phillip has not been gifted with all those extra years to define his cricket career and his life. We have with his death an inkling of what it meant to Australia when we lost Victor Trumper and Archie Jackson. Nor should we forget the two young test cricketers who died in wars in Australian uniform, 'Tibby' Cotter and Ross Gregory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Death should not come to the young. We grieve for who Phillip was and we grieve for what he might have been. Cricket will never be quite the same. What happens now is in the hands of the players, the umpires, the administrators and the wider family of cricket lovers. That is surely as it should be. Cricket belongs to those who love the game. My sincere condolences and the condolences of those I speak on behalf of today go to the family and friends of Phillip Hughes and to all in Australian cricket, and beyond, who mourn his loss.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  by leave—On behalf of the Australian Greens, I join with Senator Abetz and Senator Faulkner in expressing profound sadness at the tragic death of outstanding young Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes, the 408th Australian selected to wear the beloved baggy green for his country. Today we send our love and thoughts to his family, to his team mates, to the extended cricket family and to the community in Macksville, as we join them in mourning the tragic death, but also celebrating the life, of Phillip Joel Hughes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cricket is a much loved national sport for both players and spectators. It brings us all so much joy. But this tragic event brings us an overwhelming feeling of sadness and a coming-together to pay tribute to a wonderful young Australian. The Greens also send our support to Sean Abbott and to all other cricketers around the country. The nation is sending you strength as you reassess your engagement with this great game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mother, I dropped off my son at cricket for years, helped to unpack the bag, wash the cricket whites—going through the whole saga that families go through from one end of the country to the other as they pack up their sons and daughters to get to cricket practice and cricket games. Every time I dropped him off, I never thought that he would die playing the sport that he loved. It does not enter your head as a family as you drop off someone and go through this ritual. No doubt it is exactly the same for families everywhere, including the Hughes family. No doubt, as the family sat in the stands, their great stress for the day was whether he would play well enough to make it back into the Australian team. And by the end of the day tragedy had struck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is in part why we all find it so profoundly sad—because of its randomness. This tragedy could have hit any cricketing family anywhere, anyone's son or daughter, at any time. That is why we want the Hughes family to know that we care about what has happened to them and we share their grief and send them support. We have enormous respect for Phillip Hughes as a cricketer, but we also want them to know that we recognise he was a much loved son, and we send them our condolence.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  by leave—I rise to speak today on behalf of the Nationals in this place to remember the life of Phillip Hughes. Our thoughts are with his family and friends and the Australian cricket community on what must be a very difficult day today. Phillip Hughes was born in Macksville in 1988 and grew up in the community playing sport. As with so many young Australians, it was such an important part of his childhood. He excelled at rugby league as well as cricket, before moving to Sydney as a 17-year-old to play for the Western Suburbs grade cricket team. From there, Phil's talent and hard work delivered outstanding results on the cricket pitch. He walked on for New South Wales at age 18, scored a century in a one-day final at 19 and made his test debut for Australia at age 20. What an incredible achievement. What an honour for him and his family it must have been to see him awarded baggy green No. 408. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil Hughes was a tremendous Australian who inspired so many young people in this country, not only through his outstanding ability but also because of his down to earth and humble character. He will be remembered by all who knew him as a genuine good bloke. The effect Phil's tragic death has had on the cricket community, as well as the broader community in Australia and around the world, shows us the impact this young Australian had already made. The touching tributes that have been flowing in from our Australian cricket captain, Michael Clarke, from the New Zealand and Pakistani cricket teams who have been playing this week, from junior cricketers and from the wider community, show how much this tragedy has not only rocked the sport but also impacted on us all. It is fitting that the Australian cricket team has retired his one-day number, 64, so we can always acknowledge his special place in Australian cricket. Today is a sad day but also a day to celebrate Phil Hughes's outstanding contribution. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.</span>

                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  The government does not support the suspension of standing orders. We are now in the last two days of the parliamentary sitting. There is an orderly agenda before us and I simply put to senators that if we are going to have, yet again, another hijacking of the agenda in this the last week as a result of various coalitions of convenience across the chamber, I think we are doing ourselves a disservice in the management of not only this place but also the agenda and the matters the Australian people wish us to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not fabricate any difference in this place about who cares for the welfare of the Australian Defence Force. We all do. As a cabinet minister I live with that responsibility every day, as does the Prime Minister and as does the Minister for Defence. I trust we all live with that responsibility. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is, in relation to Defence pay, that Australia is burdened with an interest bill of $1,000 million a month, and that is being borrowed simply to pay the interest on the debt that has already been sustained. All spending has to be sustainable, even Defence spending. It is just not feasible to borrow even more money to pay for higher wages. The government needs to find an additional $16,000 million just to replace that which Labor stripped out of Defence during their six years in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In answer to a question earlier this week, I indicated what the CPI increases were and what the actual wage increases were for the Public Service, and over the last decade there was a differential of 14 per cent—the wage increases being 42 per cent and CPI 28 per cent. In relation to the ADF, just on wages the differential is some 10 per cent, and that does not take into account the, in general terms, quite generous allowances that do come with Defence Force service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also say to honourable senators who might be attracted to this proposition that the Remuneration Tribunal itself has said that it has a long-held view that setting remuneration for one office by reference to another office does not lead to defensible or meaningful wage outcomes. If we want to start setting wages in this place, we can get rid of the Fair Work Commission, get rid of the Remuneration Tribunal and get rid of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator ABETZ:</span>
                  </a>  We get a churlish, silly interjection, as we always expect, from Senator Cameron, but does he actually want the parliament to set wages? That is the issue—and now he falls silent. Of course he does not want to. If we do not want the parliament to set wages, then we should not come rushing in here with populist agendas to try to get wage increases. It is interesting that in this bill we do not have the reverse—that parliamentary salaries should, as a matter of fact, be linked to CPI. The financial situation in this country, regrettably, meant that I was duty-bound on behalf of the government to go to the Remuneration Tribunal and say that parliamentarians, secretaries, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Minister for Defence must all have any wage increases that were to come to them frozen and, for this coming year, set at zero. Why did we do that? Because the money simply is not there. When we seek to make more generous payments to anyone in Australia, that money first has to come out of the pocket of one of our fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, there is an agenda that needs to be dealt with here. We do not want the parliament setting people's wages when there are remuneration tribunals and other tribunals designed to do that. I invite senators to oppose the motion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is what we thought Senator Lambie was doing yet again, and now Senator Wong sees a genuine mistake without even having spoken to Senator Lambie. So here we are, having the opposition championing on the cause of Senator Lambie. Senator Lambie has now been in this place for a number of months and should be aware of the procedures. If Senator Lambie did not know that she should have spoken to her motion when she moved it, so be it. Let her acknowledge that. As the government we would be prepared to extend the courtesy to her.</span>

More importantly, this is not about me; this is about the men and women who wear the uniform. You know it and I know it.

Senator Lambie sought the call, and leave was denied. Then Senator Lambie, and it is her right, moved a motion to suspend standing orders. I particularly noted Senator Lambie sitting down; I paused; then Senator Abetz rose to his feet and he spoke. In fact, I started to call the question, thinking no-one was going to speak. That is exactly what happened and let us not have a different portrayal of events. Everyone has legitimately sought the call and been given the call at the appropriate time. Now we have the situation where leave, I understand, has now been granted for Senator Lambie to speak for five minutes, because Senator Lambie has indicated that she inadvertently made a mistake. Senator Lambie, you have the call.</span>

As the title of the bill indicates, if this legislation is passed by this parliament, it will guarantee that the men and women of our Defence Force receive a fair pay rise, rather than an effective pay cut in the near future—perhaps before Christmas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from Liberal and National Party members, who have wrong-headed priorities and twisted loyalties to political parties and who have not fought hard enough in their party rooms for their ADF families, who would want to stop this parliament from immediately debating and passing legislation that provides a solution to the ADF pay crisis, created by Australia's Prime Minister and Defence Minister? What debate could be more important than a debate that fundamentally affects the national security of Australia? If we do not have national security, then we do not have anything.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Senate, we daily choose to debate to pass or not legislation which affects education, health, social security, TPV, RETs, the sky-rocketing costs of electricity and fuel and the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. But if our nation is not properly secure and our Defence Force has been weakened, either by incompetence or by design, then the best health, education, social security systems in the world will ultimately be off little value to the nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordinary Tasmanians and Australians 100 per cent support the men and women of our Defence Forces 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. That is unlike some in this chamber, who by their actions or lack of actions and their silence and cowardly behaviour in their party rooms choose to live off the Anzac legend rather than live up to the Anzac legend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am looking forward to hearing every word, every syllable and every sentence of those members of this Senate who choose to deny this chamber a debate this morning on the fair pay of members of the Australian Defence Forces, with the help of a magnificent Hansard team, who skilfully record our words for Australia's history. I will make sure that every full-time member of our Army, Navy and RAAF, approximately 57,000 souls; all of their families and friends; the 20,000 reservists and all their family and friends; and every one of our 200,000 veterans out there and their all of their families and friends—all of those Australians, hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions—will get an opportunity to read or hear the poor excuses of those in this Senate who oppose a debate about a fair pay deal for our diggers this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts before this chamber are clear. Earlier this week, I meet with Mr Tony Dagger. He is the father of a serving Australian Defence Force member. Mr Dagger presented me, the opposition leader and other members of this parliament with a petition containing almost 60,000 signatures calling on this government to fix the Australian Defence Force pay injustice. Apart from Mr Dagger and his petition supporters, the hundreds and thousands of phone calls and emails to my office and to other senators offices prove why we should have this debate right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the hundreds of troops serving overseas, who are in harm's way for our benefit and who have been absolutely gutted by this government's and this Prime Minister's decision to take away $17 million of leave and entitlements and then give back the $17 million, are still facing a future with an effective pay cut. Those Australian Defence Force members and their families would like to hear the news of a debate on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 today—not a day later and not an hour later. Right now, this government and their members must explain to Australian people why they cannot afford to invest an extra $121 million dollars a year—that is it—into the pay of the men and women of our Defence Force.</span>

Let's be clear: this would not be happening if the government had done the right thing by our service men and women and this would not be happening if the government had not cut the pay and conditions of Australian Defence Force personnel—that is right, of the men and women we ask to sacrifice everything. They are being asked to pay that price by this mean government and a mean, out of touch Prime Minister who is refusing to pay them properly. It is quite simply outrageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that, they are treating those who support better pay for ADF personnel with contempt. I had the honour on Monday to meet Tony Dagger, a father who has a son in the ADF. He started an online petition on Change.org. I urge everybody listening to sign it. In a little over four weeks, this petition has been signed by more than 60,000 people. It is remarkable achievement and a clear indication of the community outrage at the government's decision to cut the ADF's pay and conditions. Did the government accept this petition with good grace? Did the government respect the work and efforts of Tony and his supporters? It may not surprise anyone, but the government did not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me read from the Change.org website, which outlines their experience on Monday of this week when meeting the Assistant Minister for Defence, the minister who talks publicly of how he is running the department. This is what they said on their website:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We (our ADF) are being compared to beer and Asprin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is right: the Assistant Minister for Defence was so dismissive of this petition that he said it was not as big as others, in support of beer and aspirin. That was the contempt with which he treated parents of our serving personnel. Quite rightly, they felt insulted and that it was disgraceful. Quite rightly, the petition organisers say that the government is arrogant, ill informed and self-centred. That is the view of the parents of serving personnel after meeting the Assistant Minister for Defence. I repeat this warning to the government that they gave:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will not go away, and we will be heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will ignore us at their peril.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing orders should be suspended so we can debate this bill. We hear the community outrage. We hear the concerns coming to us from the ADF and their families. The government had the chance to do the right thing, and they chose to do the wrong thing. Standing orders should be suspended.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  The comment just now was from a man who does not even respect the uniform of our defence forces. The people of Australia should know that the opposition's spokesman on defence disrespects the uniform that our servicemen wear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a difficult matter. The Labor Party, in determining these things, should remember that they actually had pay increases for the defence forces less than CPI on two occasions. They cut money out of the Defence Force budget. These matters should be known to those who might be listening to the debate. These matters should be known to Senator Lambie, who has been played by the Labor Party like, as my colleague said, an accordion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are difficult issues. I am delighted that the government has returned the leave entitlements that the Remuneration Tribunal took away. I congratulate my colleagues who represent the electorates where the defence forces are most prominent. They, and I as a senator based in the garrison city of Townsville, understand these issues. We also understand the $1 billion a month that the Labor Party's debt is costing Australians—$1 billion a month in borrowed money to pay off the interest on the debt that Labor ran up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are difficult situations. I know Senator Johnston and the Prime Minister are addressing the issues. It is important that we actually allow these processes to take place. We should proceed today with the agenda that has been set out for the parliament and which was agreed upon, I understand, by all parties. This interruption will not go anywhere. We should stick by the agenda that has been placed before the parliament for the last two days of this sittings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not delay the Senate any further. I conclude by again reminding anyone who might be following this debate that Labor, on two occasions, had a Defence pay increase that was less than CPI. Where was Senator Lambie then? Where was she then? It did not seem to worry her then. Where was Senator Lambie when Senator Stephen Conroy, the opposition spokesman on defence, insulted a distinguished senior serving officer of our defence forces? Where was Senator Lambie then? This is, again, the sheer hypocrisy of the Labor Party when it comes to defence issues. We should not agree to delay the agenda of the parliament.</span>

To function properly, it must adhere to the highest principles of democracy, integrity and respect. I therefore do not support Senator Lambie's suspension of standing orders because I do not believe it is the correct procedure in which to bring this to the Senate. I will not be part of this as I believe this debate deserves far more respect in this place.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator MOORE:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This bill contains the most comprehensive set of changes to Australian law on immigration and asylum seekers to be brought before the parliament since the Abbott government took office. Much of the bill is a response to actions of the judiciary. Some of the response is understandable, but much of it is an attempt to pre-empt work that the courts ought to be allowed to do. Labor has grave concerns about many of the provisions of this bill. We believe the bill should be rejected entirely. If it is given a second reading, we propose to introduce substantial amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister described the bill as a formal legislative recognition of the government's policy of turning back asylum seeker boats. He claims that this is about saving lives at sea. Let me be clear: Labor does not want to see deaths at sea. That is why, when were in government, we established asylum-seeker processing in PNG. That decision has played an enormous part in stemming the flow of boat arrivals. However, we have grave concerns about the turn-back policy, for two reasons. The first concerns the impact of the policy on Australia's relationship with Indonesia. The turn-backs have clearly harmed that relationship. If there is to be a long-term resolution to the question of boat arrivals, it could only be in the context of a close cooperation between Australia and the country from which most vessels bearing asylum seekers depart. That close cooperation existed when Labor was in office. The government's actions have destroyed it. Turn-backs have resulted in at least six incursions into Indonesian territorial waters. The other aspect of the turn-back policy that is of concern is the question of whether it does in fact save lives at sea, or whether it puts them at risk. The government have never been able to give satisfactory assurances on this question, because of their clear obsession with operational secrecy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's argument that the aim of the bill is to recognise turn-backs is deceptive. In fact, the relevant clauses of the bill are about a case now before the High Court: <span style="font-style:italic;">CPCF v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection &amp; Anor</span>. In essence, this legislation seeks to scuttle that case, which is fundamentally about the Maritime Powers Act. If the bill passes with these clauses, the precedent value of the case would be made redundant. Labor believes that this is inappropriate. The High Court has a role in upholding the rule of law that parliament must not undermine. If, after the court has made its decision, the government believes that legislation is required because of the consequences of that decision, it can bring another bill before the parliament. But it is not appropriate to legislate while the relevant case is being heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of new visas, the bill also resurrects temporary protection visas, TPVs, and creates a new class of temporary visas, the safe haven enterprise visa. Labor's position on temporary protection visas is well known. We oppose them because they place their recipients in limbo, with no certainty or assurance about their future beyond the three-year duration of the visa. Our view is that people who have been found to be entitled to Australia's protection should be given permanent protection visas and provided with assistance to settle within the community as quickly as possible. That also gets them off the government's tab, as quickly as possible, and on their way to becoming constructive and contributing members of society. Let us be clear: the vast majority of these people will live here for the rest of their lives, and want to do so. That is what we saw when TPVs were effectively abandoned during the Howard government. We should not repeat that experience. We should accept our obligations, and give those receiving Australia's protection the permanency to which they are entitled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Case Load) Bill 2014, also purports to introduce another visa class, the safe haven enterprise visa, ostensibly in fulfilment of undertakings the government made to the Palmer United Party. I say 'ostensibly' because, in fact, all this bill does is to name a new visa The explanatory memorandum states that 'the conditions and operation of SHEVs will be laid down by regulation next year'. The bill therefore holds out a glimmer of hope for permanency to those who might be eligible for the new visa, but guarantees them nothing—in fact, it tells nobody what is involved in these new visas. Labor believes that a pathway to permanent protection, and ultimately to citizenship, is worth supporting. But that pathway must be more than just a name in a bill. The government should withdraw this bill and introduce another that provides a real pathway, and it should also provide information in regulations about how it will work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy President, this is an issue I have been raising for years, with various governments: the need to have the regulation and the legislation made available at the same time, so that people can see the detail. Too often, we have the situation where the real details are in regulations which are in the future at some time. This is something that needs action across all areas of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should withdraw this bill, as we have said. If it does not and this bill reaches the committee stage, Labor will join with other senators in proposing amendments that turn the imagined pathway provided by the new visa class into a real one. Under those amendments, the new safe haven enterprise visa would be a temporary visa valid for five years and applicants for this visa would need to demonstrate their intent to work and/or study in regional Australia. If visa holders do work and/or study in a regional area for at least 3½ years of the visa period, they would become eligible for permanency. Under other amendments we would propose, the right to work would be extended to asylum seekers on bridging visas while their claims for refugee status are assessed and sections of the bill concerning temporary protection visas would be deleted. We believe these should be either abolished or automatically converted to a permanent protection visa after a successful application for refugee status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the issue of fast-tracking, the bill also seeks to change the refugee assessment process in two ways. First, the bill seeks to speed up the process for assessing claims by people who are in Australia in an unauthorised way either because they have overstayed their visa or because they have arrived without appropriate paperwork. It is not clear how this fast-track process will work, because that will depend on regulation, and details of the necessary regulations have not been provided. The second change is the replacement of the Refugee Review Tribunal by an immigration assessment authority, with a limitation of the existing right of review of adverse decisions. This change is of grave concern. Since the Abbott government was elected, Labor has supported much legislation intended to strengthen the refugee assessment process. This support has caused considerable debate, but the Labor Party has actually supported the proposition put forward by the government. In our view this change goes well beyond that. It guts the process. Labor cannot support limiting applicants' rights of review to the extent envisaged in this bill, or can we support the proposed fast-tracking of applications, which doesn't offer much by way of reducing the duration of the process but would go a long way towards reducing people's rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the refugee convention, the bill seeks to remove any reference in the act to refugees. Labor absolutely rejects this. The government argues that the bill codifies the obligations existing under the convention so that the decisions of Australian courts, rather than the decisions of international tribunals or courts in other jurisdictions, will determine Australia's law in this area. There is no good reason for this change, and it is any case unlikely to achieve the government's objective. The minister's second-reading speech makes clear that Australia remains a party to the refugee convention, and that this is given legislative effect by the Migration Act. Our courts will inevitably refer to decisions by courts in other common-law countries when determining how obligations of this kind should be interpreted in Australian law. That happens now and will continue to happen. The codification set out will not remove the established practice of judicial reasoning</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a further problem raised by the attempt to codify the law. The bill inserts a requirement in the act that, if persons are able to alter their behaviour reasonably, they should not be able to claim Australia's protection. There are cases now before Australian courts in which a version of that requirement is under consideration, and courts have made decisions on a similar basis in the past, but setting the requirement down in fixed, statutory form raises questions that would not be easy to resolve. What if someone sought protection of the basis of sexual preference, but protection was denied on the basis that alteration of their behaviour would result in that person not being persecuted in his or her country of origin? That may not be the intention of this schedule, but it is not difficult to see how such a possibility could arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains a provision removing the 90-day rule for hearing of asylum claims, which is an important accountability measure. At the time of last year's federal election, when Labor left government, about half of protection applications were decided within the prescribed 90 days; but, in the most recent report on the Abbott government's performance, only 14 per cent of decisions were being made within go days. The 90-day rule, which was introduced by the Howard government, has proven its worth as a test of the speed with which governments process applications. The rules should be retained. If the 90-day rule is not being met by the department, there should be rationale as to why it is not being met. Rather than changing the rule, there should be an acceptance that the 90-day rule stays and that exceptions to that should be subject to question and a process of explanation from the department to the minister and then to the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of these reasons, Labor opposes this bill, and we will vote to deny it a second reading.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Today I stand here with the overwhelming majority of legal and human rights experts in this country to condemn the regressive and dangerous Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 before us today. This piece of legislation, if it were to pass, would be a fundamental shift from what are known as due process, fairness before the law, a fair go under the refugee system and, of course, the proper checks and balances to make sure whoever is the government of the day is abiding by our international obligations as well as the basic rules and values of decency and fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill should not be called the asylum legacy case bill. It should be called the immigration minister's outrageous grab for power bill. That is all that is in this piece of legislation. This bill is all about Scott Morrison, as the Minister for Immigration, grabbing more power for himself to dictate who will be a refugee, under what conditions they will be a refugee and whether or not they get access to a visa. Of course, overarching all of this is whether children and families remain languishing in terrible conditions on Christmas Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the way we treat refugees in this country, never before have we seen a bill as insidious, as deceptive and as downright dangerous as this. It is a smorgasbord of suffering, a buffet of brutality, and it should not be allowed to pass this place today. Within this bill the immigration minister wants to make babies that are being born in Australia stateless. He wants to send those babies to camps of cruelty offshore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He wants to give himself a licence to break international law. He wants to rip the refugee convention from the Australian law books. He wants to change the very definition of who is and who is not a refugee. He wants to fast-track the refugee determination process to remove the right of review, meaning there would be less protection for people who deserve it, less protection for people who may, as a result of mistakes, be sent back to death and torture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He wants to deny protection to as many refugees as possible. He wants to introduce temporary protection visas for those who have been found to be in genuine need of protection, making them suffer even more for the fact that they dared to dream of freedom and safety for their families. That will leave thousands of refugees—genuine refugees who have been through the proper process, who desperately need protection and have every right to start putting their lives back together—in limbo effectively for the rest of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He wants to trick the Senate crossbench into thinking that a new visa that is being offered is a pathway to permanency when there is no detail of the safe haven enterprise visa in this legislation. If the minister thinks he can continue to trick this Senate and the crossbenchers in this place, he better think twice because he cannot. It is as clear as day that this minister has no intention of following through with the agreement that was made with the Palmer United Party and with the statements that have been made. He wants only more power for himself and less protection for refugees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an unbelievable grab of power from the minister, and senators in this place have the opportunity to stop this minister, who is so arrogant and so drunk with power, from being able to have even more unfettered discretion. The immigration minister wants to give himself the ability to play God. He wants to be the judge, the jury and the executioner in all these cases. He wants to send refugees, including families and children, back to danger in their homelands. The whole point of this bill is to give as few refugees as possible the opportunity for protection. Even if they are granted protection, he will not even bother to give them a permanent visa that will allow them to rebuild their lives and allow them to contribute to this country. We have thousands of refugees living in the Australian community desolate, without work rights, without the ability to study and without even the right to be able to volunteer. All these people want to be able to do is get on with the rest of their lives—</span>

                    </a>  Right now there are about 30,000 asylum seekers waiting for processing in Australia. Disturbingly, there are also 559 children in detention facilities across the country. In total there are 3,084 people in detention here in Australia. To our great shame, there are 167 children locked up on Nauru and in total 1,095 people are detained on Nauru and 1,056 on Manus Island. There is no question that these people need to have their claims processed immediately and be taken out of detention, put into the community and given the opportunity to start contributing to this country and rebuilding their lives. This bill does none of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Astonishingly, the immigration minister is using the suffering of these children in detention as a disgusting bargaining chip. He is trying to blackmail the Senate crossbench into accepting this cruel bill by threatening to send each and every one of them to the hellhole on Nauru. How appalling to see the minister who already has so much power—the power to keep people in detention—and who is keeping these children locked up, threaten this place today by saying: 'If you do not pass the bill the way I like it, it is my way or the highway. The children will remain in jail.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What kind of human being uses children as his pawns in a game of politics? How gross, distasteful and sickening is the minister if he is willing to do this? These are children and they are being destroyed by these policies. The immigration minister is threatening to turn the screws on them even harder. He says that until he gets his own way he will keep them locked up in appalling conditions—conditions that have been condemned by the United Nations and condemned by our own Human Rights Commission here in Australia. That is not being a leader; that is being a bully and a coward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the immigration minister does not want senators in this chamber to understand is that he can release all of these children today if he wants to. He has the power to keep them in detention or to release them into the community. You do not need a bill that condemns them to a life of uncertainty just to get them out of the locked gates and out from behind the barbed wire. He can have them in the community and be processing their claims as we speak. He is actually obliged to do that under the current domestic law, but in fact he is refusing to act as the law currently prescribes to process people's claims, to get on with assessing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they are genuine refugees, let them stay and let them get on with their lives. If they are not, then send them home. No-one is arguing that anyone should get a free ride here. Get on and process their claims. If they are refugees, they can stay. If they are not, deport them. At the moment we have the worst of both worlds. We have a minister who is keeping children locked up, incarcerated in immigration prisons, and babies being born to asylum seeker parents being told they have no right to protection in Australia. Despite being born in Australian hospitals, they will be on the next flight to Nauru, where we know children are being abused and are witnessing abuse every single day.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate inquiry into this bill heard from thousands of human rights lawyers, refugee advocates, academics and community members, all of whom object to this outright. Over 5,000 submissions were made to this Senate inquiry and every single one of them bar the immigration minister's own department said this bill was wrong, said this bill would set Australia up for failure when it comes to looking after some of the world's most vulnerable people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overwhelming evidence from experts and the community was that this bill cannot pass, must not pass. Who does this minister think he is to delete the refugee convention from our law books—to say that we will delete the refugee convention from our law books and it will be he who interprets our obligations? Scott Morrison, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, wants this Senate to give him the power to dictate who is a refugee and who is not—unfettered, unchecked and not able to be appealed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is obliged to provide protection to those who arrive on our shores. We are obliged to do that under international law, but we are actually required to do it as part of being a good global citizen—as a nation that stands for fairness, as a nation and that cares about the rule of law, as a nation who proudly drafted the refugee convention 60 years ago because we did not want to see vulnerable people turned away and deported back to danger. And here we have a bill that in the midst of the political heat of the refugee issue here in Australia we have the Abbott government wanting to undermine and delete those very values from our law books.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some ways forward in how we manage the needs of refugees and asylum seekers in this country. There are 30,000 people who need their claims assessed. Get on and assess them, find out whether they do need protection or not. If they do, we resettle them and we let them get on with our lives—we get them into the workforce, we get the students and the children into school, we allow families to rebuild here in Australia and contribute to our local communities. If they are not refugees, finish their application process and send them home. But give people who do need assistance a fair go—and that means a genuine pathway to permanency.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SHEV visa that has been spoken about and was part of the Palmer United Party's deal on this piece of legislation is not what is before us today. There is no detail about how the safe haven enterprise visa would work. Why would that be? It is because the minister has no intention of following through on his obligations. If he did it would be in the legislation or there would be substantial amendments that would have been circulated and talked through in this place. But we see none of that from the government. This is, 'My way or the highway,' according to the immigration minister and the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing in this piece of legislation that upholds the original deal between the Palmer United Party and Scott Morrison. In addition to that, they have stapled on six other schedules in this piece of legislation that fundamentally undermine the spirit of that arrangement in the first place: more people will be in detention, children born here in Australia sent off to the detention camps on Nauru, deleting the refugee convention, handing ultimate power to the minister to make a decision as to who he thinks deserves his tick of approval and who does not. We know the track record of this minister on these issues and he doesn't give two hoots about the humanitarian needs of those who have come to our shores. Why do we know that? Because we see that he is keeping children locked in appalling conditions every day. Every day those children remain in detention they are damaged further. Mr Morrison keeps them there locked up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens agree with the majority submitters to the inquiry into this bill that this is a radical deviation from Australia's longstanding commitment to international law and human rights. If this bill passes, it will seriously endanger the lives of many thousands of asylum seekers. The Greens strongly recommend that this bill be rejected by this place today. There would need to be substantial amendments made to this bill if it were to proceed. Six of the seven schedules would need to be deleted and the remaining schedule would need to have a genuine pathway to permanency, so that if people are found to be refugees—after all this time they have spent in detention, all this time they have been left dumped in the community—they should be able to stay, work, pay their taxes and send their kids to school. It is simply asking for a fair go and for people to be treated with dignity and respect. As this bill stands none of that is in here. I strongly urge this place to vote it down at the second reading.</span>

We have just had another example of that. Don't worry about what is actually in the bill; just use your normal, emotive language that you use on everyone, as I say, no matter how inaccurate and what complete mistruths those statements are. Let me take up some of the things Senator Hanson-Young said. She said, for example: 'We are going to delete the refugee convention from the Australian books.' </span>

                    </a>  It is not just wrong, Minister—it is absolutely ludicrous that that would be suggested. But it is the typical thing. I have been around for a while and I have been able to work out the Greens. They never bother about the facts, never bother about the legislation; they just come out with whatever lie they can think of and try and fool the public—and it works with the eight per cent or so of Australians who do vote for the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I experienced Senator Ludlam talking about the telephone interception bill and quite unashamedly saying, 'If this metadata legislation goes through the government, Big Brother will be able to know exactly what you are looking at on your computer.' I was not involved in the debate, but I thought, 'Hang on, I have just been through a Senate inquiry into this, and that is simply wrong!' So I got up and I said to the chamber, 'That is wrong, Senator Ludlam!', and he sat there in the corner with a big smile on his face and nodded. That is the way the Greens behave—do not bother about the truth, do not bother about what the legislation says; just tell any old lie and hope that some people will believe you. As I say, eight per cent of the people clearly do believe the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written down some of Senator Hanson-Young's words, but I should not have to write them down, because you hear them all the time—'unforgivable', 'drunk with power', 'unfettered discretion', 'play God', 'refugees sent back to danger'—it goes on. If you listened to Senator Hanson-Young just then, check what she said back against any speech she has ever made on migration and you will get the same sorts of words. Can I again put out another deliberate mistruth by the previous speaker? She said there are, outrageously, 559 children still in detention—384 in Australia and 167 on Manus Island. Actually, she knows as well as I do that there are 167 on Christmas Island. But let me give you the full facts about children in detention, to put this all in perspective. When John Howard left the government as Prime Minister there were zero, zilch, none—no children in immigration detention. Under six years of Labor government supported by Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Wright and their party, we had thousands of children in detention and thousands of children who lost their lives at sea. We never heard any condemnation from Senator Hanson-Young over the loss of lives of children at sea. Not once did we hear that. Why? Because it was under the watch of the Labor Party, who the Greens kept in power—in fact they were part of that power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When John Howard left government zero children were in immigration detention. When Tony Abbott became Prime Minister there were 1,743 children in detention centres. Did we hear from Senator Hanson-Young about that? No. Did we hear from the Human Rights Commission about that? No. But that was a year ago—1,743 children in immigration detention. Since the Abbott government has been in power, and thanks to the good work of Senator Cash and Mr Morrison, the relevant ministers, that number is now down to 647. You do not have to take my word for this—have a look at the evidence given at the estimates hearing held last Thursday in this building, a hearing that Senator Hanson was at. She knows these figures: 1,743 when the Abbott government took over, when Mr Morrison and Senator Cash started dealing with Labor's problem. Now there are only 647 in immigration detention. At estimates last week—and Senator Hanson-Young was there, so she knows this—I said to the officials: 'What is the forward projection? What do you think is going to happen to these 647?' And I was told—and it is on the record in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>; you can go and look at it yourself—that by June next year there would be no children in immigration detention. No children. I said to them, 'What does "no" mean?', and they said, 'We will be trying to get to nil, but we can almost guarantee less than 100.'  That was on the proviso that this legislation gets through the parliament so the officials can have the necessary authority to do what needs to be done to get those children out of immigration detention.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you had heard Senator Hanson-Young, would you believe that that was the case? Of course you would not, because they will tell any lie, misstate any fact, to convince a few vulnerable voters that the Greens have a heart. The Greens do not have a heart. If they had a heart they would not have been part of thousands of people losing their lives at sea under the watch of the Greens political party and Labor, and there would not have been 1,743 children in detention at the end of their time in government. These are facts. They are not emotive words; they are not any old lie to try and gather a little bit of political support from the few who would believe that sort of rubbish. You see, this is not just Senator Hanson-Young—any member of the Greens political party is the same. They will just say anything, anything at all, to get a vote. I mentioned Senator Ludlam's comment—which he acknowledged! He knew it was a lie. But did that stop him from saying it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the lies that the Greens propagate, and they expect people to believe them. Senator Hanson-Young says these children are 'behind barbed wire' in prison camp. Again, go and see what the officials said about that very subject last Thursday at estimates. They said there is no barbed wire around—the only chain wire fences are around the swimming pools that are put there for the children. Yet if anyone would believe Senator Hanson-Young, and I suspect that as every day goes past there are fewer and fewer people who do believe her, all 647 children in detention are behind barbed wire. How emotive!</span>

It is a shame there is someone in the Senate, a colleague of the house, who tells deliberate untruths about children in detention being behind barbed wire. When that question was put to officials last Thursday in a Senate estimates committee hearing, I think their comment was that the only chain wire fences, which of course are required in every Australian jurisdiction, are around the swimming pools.</span>

We will do everything possible to stop children from drowning, unlike the Greens and the Labor Party who presided over the deaths at sea of hundreds and hundreds of children and nary a word of condemnation. I hope someone will be able to apologise on behalf of the Greens later in this debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson-Young uses words like 'the minister is a bully and a coward and he bullies children in detention camps'. Those of you who know Mr Morrison and Senator Cash know that you would not find any more humane people than those two people. They are there trying to do a job. I might say the Australian people asked us at the last election to stop the boats. Had they been stopped during the Labor regime, there would not have been 30,000 people in immigration detention at the moment, there would not have been 30,000 people wanting to have their cases dealt with. Not in this particular bill but in other bills before the parliament the minister is trying to give certainty to those people who are in Australia at the moment. If Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens political party wanted to have a look at the bill they would see that the bill before us is particularly beneficial. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a period of up to three  years. Senator Hanson-Young would have told you in her speech—if anyone who listened believed it—that nobody was going to get a temporary protection visa. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a period of up to three years. On the expiration, a person's circumstances will be reassessed. Those who are found to still be owed protection will be granted a further temporary protection visa or what is called a SHEV. I want to  talk about the safe haven enterprise visa because I think it is a very good initiative of the government. I congratulate Senator Cash and Mr Morrison for doing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with the Abbott government's principles of rewarding enterprise and its belief in a strong regional Australia, a new visa called the safe haven enterprise visa will be created. The safe haven enterprise visa will be open to applications from those who have been processed under the legacy case load and those who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. The SHEV will be an alternative temporary visa to the temporary protection visa and will encourage enterprise through earning and learning. That is a great initiative. Perhaps the minister can elaborate in her speech on how it is going to be introduced. I think it will be introduced by regulation very shortly. The visa will be valid for five years and, like a temporary protection visa, it will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SHEV holders who have worked in regional Australia without requiring access to income support for 3½ years will be able to apply for and, if they meet eligibility requirements, will be granted other onshore visas—for example, family and skilled visas as well as temporary, skilled and student visas. So contrary to what Senator Hanson-Young would have you believe, this bill contains a lot of protections and it starts to bring some order to the chaotic situation left to us by the Labor and Green government of the last six years, a government which presided over many deaths at sea, including the deaths of children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hope Senator Hanson-Young might rise at some time during the day and apologise for misleading the Senate about those statistics on the children. She should because she was at the estimates committee just last Thursday when all of these figures were explained by officials. There were zero children in detention when the Howard government was defeated. When the Abbott government came to power, there were 1,743 children in detention, with not a word from the Greens and not a word from the Human Rights Commission. Since that time, in a short 12 months, over 1,000 of those children have been released and by June next year, according to officials—this is their hope, if they are given the authority to do this—there will be no children left in immigration detention. One would have thought that, if the Greens had any care at all, if they had any compassion, if they cared about children in detention they would be the first ones here supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my honour and pleasure to chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which looks into these bills very carefully. Senator Hanson-Young would tell you, I think she said, that there were 5,000 submitters to this inquiry. Well, sorry; there was a petition—the sort of petition you leave at the coffee shop and everyone signs it without knowing what is in it—but the number of submitters is clearly shown in the committee's report and, I am sorry, Senator Hanson-Young, they do not reach 5,000 or 2,000 or whatever other exaggerated number you might have said. There were the usual witnesses at the hearings; a lot of them are refugee advocates. I might say that I think the government's decision not to have taxpayer funding for these migration agents has caused some concern in the migration agents industry. We do get a number of people who, I concede and I congratulate them, do have some expertise in this area; however, they come from a particular view. We on this side come from the view that Australia has an ordered immigration system. We take around 14,000 refugees every year. But if you jump the queue, and if you are wealthy enough to pay the people smugglers—I often wonder whether the people smugglers are donors to the Greens political party; you would think there might be some other reason why the Greens are so in favour of the people smugglers—</span>

                    </a>  Very selective, Senator Moore, but then you would expect that from Labor, because Labor and the Greens presided over the worst mess that Australia has seen. Clearly the Greens and Labor do not want people to understand this, but Australia takes about 14,000 refugees every year. This means that, on a per capita basis, Australia is one of the best countries in the world for accepting refugees. We punch well above our weight.</span>

If they come in illegally by sea, then those who are waiting their turn in squalid refugee camps around the world who have already been determined by the UNHCR to be genuine refugees miss out. They have to wait yet another year. I just want to bring some reality to this debate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WRIGHT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I rise today to speak about the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 and to put clearly on the record my disgust for what is an outrageously cruel bill. The content of this bill sends shivers down the spine of all Australians who care about human rights and who consider that the moral health of our nation can be judged by how we treat our fellow human beings who are most in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If passed, this bill will widen the immigration minister's powers, marginalise international law and the rules of natural justice and muzzle the ability of Australian courts to scrutinise the government's treatment of asylum seekers. It will also establish a new high-water mark in the cruelty Australia is willing to show to those men, women and children who come to us from persecution and violence and throw themselves on our mercy. Increasingly, our wellsprings of mercy are running completely dry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The title of this bill refers to the legacy caseload—that is, the 30,000 people who sought Australia's protection between August 2012 and December 2013 and who have suffered the physical and mental anguish of mandatory detention, family separation, uncertainty about their legal status, and the constant risk of removal to Nauru or Manus Island. To quote the New South Wales Bar Association, this bill goes far beyond what is necessary to deal with the legacy caseload. It involves serious departures from Australia's international obligations to human rights and, more generally, to the extent that the bill does deal with the legacy caseload, it does so in a way which is procedurally unjust and unfair. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the thousands of submissions received by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has described the bill as 'punitive and nasty' and written so as to suggest that, 'asylum seekers are being punished for their temerity in seeking our compassion; for taking at face value our oft-proclaimed commitment to human rights and the rule of law.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with other migration bills before the parliament, this bill constitutes the single biggest change to Australia's asylum seeker policy ever made. The bill's six schedules would fundamentally change the way protection claims are assessed. The bill changes the criteria by which a person is found to be owed protection and the nature of the protection provided by Australia to those in genuine need. It also changes the legal status of those seeking our protection and empowers a range of government agencies to restrict or remove their liberty. In each schedule, the bill removes the now rare existing features of the Migration Act which operate to protect the rights and interests of asylum seekers, in favour of a system that departs from international law and rule of law principles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Greens spokesperson on legal affairs, I have to raise particular concerns about those features of the bill that remove procedural rights and review rights, longstanding protections against oppression in our Australian legal system. These features prescribe a legal framework for the determination of refugee and protection status that is contrary to international law and rule of law principles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a move of shameless legal manipulation, the government uses this bill to remove references to the refugee convention from the Migration Act and replaces them with the government's own interpretation of the convention. How can we possibly persuade other countries to fulfil their international obligations when our own actions show that we are prepared to manipulate and undermine an important international convention? Our hypocrisy will be seen for what it is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also removes fundamental procedural rights to safeguard the integrity of what can be a life-or-death decision about a person's need for protection. It does this by introducing a new fast-track procedure which will give asylum seekers one shot at setting out the evidence needed to substantiate their protection claim to an immigration official, but without providing them any access to independent advice or support. They will not be able to have the merits of the claim reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many other egregious betrayals of human rights and rule of law principles in this bill. Unfortunately I do not have the time to go into it. But there is a deep chasm between this proposed law and a principled, fair and dignified approach to providing protection to those in genuine need. The Australian Greens strenuously oppose the passage of this bill. This bill is indefensible and un-Australian.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I am not really sure why Senator Wright did not have the time to go into the detail of this bill; she had another 15 minutes on the clock. Perhaps it would have been better if Senator Wright did go into some of the detail. I think that the Greens in this debate do not want to get bogged down in detail because that would mean getting bogged down in facts, and the facts do not support their argument. That is why we heard that five minute contribution. That is why we heard the hysterical contribution from Sarah Hanson-Young earlier, the disgraceful contribution from Senator Hanson-Young. The hypocrisy that we see in an ongoing way from the Greens on this issue and from the Labor Party on this issue—</span>

                    </a>  I do apologise. The hypocrisy we have seen from the likes of Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Wright and Labor senators on this issue is absolutely extraordinary. I can see why Senator Wright would not want to get into the detail of this, because the detail does not back their argument. The detail does not back the Greens argument. It does not back the argument that comes from the left of the Labor Party, which seems to now be dominating them in opposition once more on this issue of border protection and illegal arrivals. </span>

But in opposition unfortunately, as we see with this bill again today, the Labor Party is showing that it has not learnt a thing. It has shown that, if it is ever given the opportunity again to govern and to be responsible for the border protection of this nation, it will go back to the same old failed policies that the Greens advocate here openly and which the Labor Party has pretended is not part of their policy any more, but we are seeing it more and more.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the difference in approach on this issue between the coalition government and the Labor-Greens view of the world, as put in place in government when they were there and as continued to be advocated by the opposition and by the Greens here today in an ongoing way. The difference is crystal clear. The Labor-Greens policy saw 50,000 illegal arrivals. We saw a flood of people coming to this country illegally and claiming refugee status. We saw at least 1,200 people drown in an effort to get to Australia, lured by the bad policies which were put in place by the Labor-Greens coalition—by the Labor Party in government, egged on by their Greens partners. That is their legacy. There were something like 2,000 children in detention under the Labor Party at one point, because they had been lured here. There were children and adults who got on those boats and did not make it here. That is the tragedy of these policy failures. We have seen a dramatic turnaround on all of those indicators—and I will go to each of them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who really cares about this issue should acknowledge that the coalition's policies have actually seen a positive shift, because people are not drowning any more. We should be celebrating that fact. We should be celebrating the fact that we see fewer people in detention, fewer children in detention, now than when we came to office. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard Senator Macdonald's excellent contribution earlier where he talked about what the committee had been told in relation to the dramatic reduction in numbers that we had seen. And in fact the expectation is that those numbers will continue to reduce so that we will see, hopefully very soon, a situation where we do not any more have children in detention, just as we did at the end of the Howard government. That is the legacy when you get control of the borders. When you get this policy right, not only do you stop the drownings, not only do you regain control of the borders but you also see the ability for governments to effectively deal with these issues, and that is what the coalition is getting on with the job of dealing with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do find it extraordinary—we expect it from the Greens as they are quite extreme on this issue and we have come to expect it from parts of the Labor Party, though it is concerning—that a party of government, the opposition in this nation, still allows itself to go back to a policy direction which it acknowledges failed. Labor ministers saw that those policies were failing. They were failing Australia, they were failing our responsibilities, they were failing those who got on boats and did not make it here and they were failing those who waited in refugee camps overseas who could not be resettled because there were far too many people coming here and claiming asylum. So the policies failed across the board, and the Labor Party continues to advocate them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do find it extraordinary that we see protests. I have had protests at my office in recent times, and people are entitled to protest. Some of those protesters and some of those who were silent when people were drowning—and many of those people were silent when people were drowning—are now coming out and are very loud. As I said, we had had 50,000 arrivals but what has happened this year? I think there has been one successful people smuggling venture to this country this year compared to 50,000 arrivals over the term of the Labor government. Those people should be saying that is a good thing and some of them occasionally acknowledge that but many do not. The Greens party certainly does not. I have not heard the Labor Party acknowledge it. But I would ask those protesters, as well-intentioned as some of them may be: why were they silent when people were drowning trying to get here because of bad policy? They were silent. Many of them were silent. They believe that those policies were reasonable, well, they were not and they failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why was the Human Rights Commissioner silent? It was extraordinary, the evidence we heard recently, where the Human Rights Commissioner said that her concerns were there in late 2012. She had concerns about these issues in late 2012 but she chose not to launch an inquiry in 2012. She chose not to launch an inquiry while there was a Labor government all through 2013 and the boats continued to arrive, when numbers peaked at 2,000 children in detention. Apparently the Human Rights Commission was not concerned enough to inquire into that. Lo and behold there was a change of government to a coalition government. We stopped the boats, we started to significantly reduce the number of children in detention and that was when the Human Rights Commission thought it was a good time to start inquiring. Based on those facts, you would have to question the impartiality of such a body. It had got concerns from late 2012 and did nothing about it until after there was a change of government. That change of government actually significantly improved the situation that the Human Rights Commission was concerned about, but that was when it started to inquire. So Australians could be forgiven for thinking that many of these activists and the Human Rights Commission are not coming to this in an impartial way. They are actually found out to be quite partisan on this, and I think that is unfortunate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's look at the record on these issues that we are told are of concern. All of us should be concerned about people getting on a leaky boat and not making it here. Thank God that no longer appears to be happening. It is a very rare thing. Thank God we have not seen drownings in recent times. We should all be pleased with that outcome. Surely that is something we can all agree on—that that is a good thing and that that is a significant improvement. Surely that has come about due to policy change because the message has gone out that that is not the path the residency. Getting on that leaky boat is no longer the path to residency in this country and that must be good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are reducing the numbers, we are getting through the legacy case load and this legislation goes to that legacy case load. It must be a good thing that we are seeing fewer and fewer children in detention. In fact there are far fewer children in detention now than when we came to office. The expectation is that with the right policy settings that will go down to zero as soon as possible, and that is what we should be striving for. I say to some of those critics including the Human Rights Commission, including some of those protesters: why not actually look at those facts and say we are heading in that direction? We are stopping the drownings, we are seeing fewer children in detention and we are getting order back into our immigration system—order that was sadly lacking for the past six years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In taking significant measures, the coalition now has to deal with the legacy case load that was left to us by the Labor-Greens, Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. That is what we are doing and this legislation is about dealing with that. Labor and the Greens now, having created the problem, are again trying to sabotage the solution and are denying work rights to thousands of people—because people who are voting against this bill are denying work rights. So the Greens on the one hand say they want to see work rights but there is a policy in place from the Labor Party that denies people work rights. We are looking to reinstate them through this legislation and they are voting against it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does that say about their commitment? What does that say about their commitment to these people? It says it all—that they would far prefer to pontificate and to oppose, and to go back to their failed policies, than actually help us deal with solutions that will improve the lot of many but that will maintain the integrity of our immigration system. If we do not maintain the integrity of our immigration system we can see the catastrophic results: we see the thousands of people drowning, we see children in detention and we see all of the things that we do not want to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this bill does; it honours the coalition's commitment to restore the full suite of border protection and immigration measures to stop the boats. It reintroduces temporary protection visas; it introduces the safe haven enterprise visa—which is also a temporary visa; it reinforces the government's powers to undertake maritime turnbacks; and it introduces rapid processing and streamlined review arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue around turnbacks is an important one and it is worth reflecting on. Turnbacks have worked. Turnbacks have been an important part of the suite of policy measures that the coalition has put in place. Richard Marles knows this. Richard Marles acknowledged the turnbacks have worked.</span>

He was speaking the truth. It was a rare moment from this Labor opposition, where he was acknowledging that the policies that we have put in place have worked, and he was very quickly undermined by others in the Labor Party, including his own leader.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The turnbacks do work. The turnbacks are part of a suite of measures that have sent a very clear message that getting on a leaky boat and paying a people smuggler is not the path to citizenship in this country. It is not. We have made that absolutely clear, and that should be reinforced. All of our policies should reinforce that, rather than undermine that as they did under the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I often have discussions, as I said, with advocates. Many of them are well intentioned, but I think those advocates forget—and what they cannot seem to reconcile—that if you are going to have a limit on the number of people you take in an immigration setting then you have to have rules. Whether you take them in the humanitarian space, in refugee places or more broadly, if you are going to limit the refugee space—and virtually all Australians would agree that we have to have a limit—then we have to set those limits in terms of how many people come to Australia. If you are going to do that then you have to have rules and you have to enforce those rules. If you do not enforce those rules then the people smugglers get to choose. They get to choose who gets to be accepted as a refugee in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those who languish in other countries in refugee camps—and I have spoken to many of them who are now in my electorate. Many of them waited for many years. I am not saying that some of the people who have arrived here by boat do not have legitimate claims. I am saying that we should not have a policy that is set up to give favouritism and preference, and to make the test of whether you are accepted as a refugee in this country being whether you can arrive here. Under the previous government—under lax border protection policies—those who got here got preference. Those who do not have the means to get here—those who, one would argue, are the most disadvantaged; of all the displaced people, those with the least means—they are the ones who are most disadvantaged under the former policies. They will never get a look-in because there will always be someone who gets preference by paying a people smuggler and getting here. So, if you acknowledge that we have to have limits then we have to have rules, and those rules have to be enforced. That is at the heart of the difference in how we do border protection and how we manage these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other significant problems that have flowed from those failed policies. Because so much extra money was being spent we saw cutbacks in other areas—things like Customs screening were cut back significantly under the former government; they were running out money because they blew such a hole in the budget. That is also important. It is important that we screen what is coming into this country, whether it is drugs or other illegal goods. That was undermined because the whole system was in chaos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reintroduction of TPVs is fundamental to the government's key objectives to process the current backlog of protection claims. The government is providing temporary protection to those IMAs who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. TPVs will be granted for a maximum of three years and will provide access to Medicare, social security benefits and work rights. This is a really important part of this legislation: it is providing work rights. The alternative from those who want to vote against this is to deny work rights so that people who have not been processed and who are waiting cannot actually work to sustain themselves. Surely, that is not a good outcome? Surely that is not something that should be advocated, yet it is. It is being advocated; whether they say it or not, that is what they are advocating with their vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of other aspects to this bill, but it fundamentally goes to continuing our job of fixing the problems that we inherited when it comes to border protection. We have made amazing strides in that area, because we no longer see the boats, we no longer see the deaths at sea and we are seeing the numbers of children in detention dramatically reduced. All of those things are great strides, which have come about through strong border protection policies. This is the next step; this is the next part of dealing with that legacy, and I would commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014. This bill is a key part of the coalition government's promise to stop the boats. The coalition government, through this bill, is introducing a package of measures to resolve the immigration status of the illegal maritime arrivals legacy caseload, which currently sits at a staggering 30,000 people who arrived under the policies of the former Labor-Greens government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, when we came to government there were over 33,000 unresolved cases, 27,000 of which had not even started to be dealt with, and some of them had been in detention since August 2012. This bill honours the coalition's commitment to restore the full suite of border protection and immigration measures to stop the boats. These measures were successfully used under the Howard government but abolished by the former Labor government. I was working for the Howard government when we introduced these measures and faced this crisis over a decade ago. What happened under the previous Labor-Greens coalition was utterly foreseeable because we had been there before. We knew if you put the people smugglers back into business and you gave them a business model and a product to sell, they would do it. There is absolutely no surprise that once you implemented these policies then a flood of people would start to come in again. In fact, 50,000 people paid people smugglers to enter this country illegally. That was totally foreseeable, as were the consequences. If you get that many people coming in on boats you know people will die on the journey. You know that when they arrive they will have to be put into detention, and you also know they will have to be processed. But despite all of this being foreseeable as a consequence of the policy so irresponsibly implemented by those opposite, they did not make the provisions to process this increasing flood of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite talk about compassion all the time. Listening to the debate on this bill, and on similar bills and issues in recent times, I am still struggling—in fact, I find it impossible—to find compassion in a policy that entices people either to their deaths or to indefinite detention in this country. I do not understand the compassion; I see no compassion. In fact, with this legacy caseload, under the system of processing implemented and maintained by those opposite when in government, 30,000 people are still languishing under this system. Now what does that mean? It means 30,000 mothers, fathers and children whose lives are in limbo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent legislative committee hearing into this legislation, the department of immigration said that 'the government has made it very clear that no illegal maritime arrival will be granted a permanent protection visa. If this legislation is not passed, illegal maritime arrivals will remain barred from being able to lodge an application for a permanent protection visa.' So anybody who opposes this bill will be actively ensuring that these people remain in limbo. The question for these 30,000-plus people is: how long will they remain in limbo? The department said that 'if the government continued to process the IMA backlog for consideration of a grant of a temporary humanitarian concern visa in lieu of the TPVs'—which those on the other side have been blocking; now this is the important bit—'it is estimated that the backlog under the Labor-Greens legislation and processes would take at least seven years to process.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say that again: if those opposite block this legislation it will mean that 30,000 people will remain in limbo, many of them for up to seven years. I struggle to understand where the compassion is in that—that is, leaving people, who were enticed to pay to come to this country, in limbo for a further seven years. Surely the most compassionate option would be to speed up their processing time by years so that they can get a decision: yes, they can stay on one of the new visas we are proposing; or, no, they cannot. Surely it is better to give people the news as soon as possible and not leave them in limbo indefinitely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will reintroduce temporary protection visas and will introduce safe haven enterprise visas, which are also temporary visas. It will reinforce the government's powers to undertake maritime turn backs and it will introduce rapid processing and streamlined review arrangements. Surely a compassionate response is to provide visas; to get people out in the community and provide them with an opportunity to work. It is not compassionate to provide permanent visas. This would again put the people smugglers back in business and we would start all over again with the deaths, with the arrivals, and with more people and more children in detention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures deliver on the government's election commitments to reintroduce these TPVs, to ensure that no IMA will be granted a permanent protection visa, and critically, and most compassionately, to process Labor's backlog of 30,000 asylum seekers. This should come as no surprise to anybody in this chamber or anybody in the Australian community. The reintroduction of TPVs is fundamental to the government's key objectives to process the current backlog of IMA claims. I was on the committee inquiry into this bill; I heard the submissions from a wide range of people. Not a single one of them put forward a credible and implementable solution to this backlog that would not put the people smugglers back in business. To me, that is not the responsible and the compassionate course of action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this policy from our government, we are providing temporary protection to those illegal maritime arrivals who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. Temporary protection visas will be granted for a maximum of three years and will provide access to Medicare, social security benefits and work rights, despite what those opposite have been claiming. However, most importantly, temporary protection visas will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia. Those of you who have had a look at recent committee testimony from a number of different inquiries will see that that is one of the products that people smugglers sell: you send us your young children—'anchor children'—and if they get in and get a visa, you can bring your whole family in. That is a horrific and an inhumane offering on behalf of the people smugglers and we cannot not deal with it.</span>

                    </a>  If Senator Whish-Wilson thinks that sending children by boat is a compassionate way to deal with children and that there are remotely has any human rights aspects to it, he is welcome to address that in the chamber later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These visas will be credited for a period of up to three years. On expiration, a person's individual circumstances will quite reasonably be reassessed. Those who are found to still be owed protection will only be granted a further TPV or a SHEV, a safe haven enterprise visa. If they are found not to engage Australia's protection obligations, they will be required to leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with this government's principles of rewarding enterprise and its belief in a strong regional Australia, a new visa, the safe haven enterprise visa, will also be created by this bill. Again, it absolutely astounds me that people in this chamber, people who represent rural and regional communities in this country, would not be supportive of this new visa. The safe haven enterprise visa will be open to applications by those who have been processed under this legacy case load and who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. They will be an alternative to the TPV and will also encourage enterprise through learning and earning, which I think is wonderful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those granted a SHEV will work in designated regions, identified through a national self-nomination process. These visas will be valid for five years and, like the TPV, will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia because, again, that is another product for people smugglers to sell. Holders of these visas will be targeted to designated regions and encouraged to fill regional job vacancies, and will have access to the same support arrangements as a TPV holder, including Medicare, social security benefits and work rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few months as a senator in this place and from my travels around regional Western Australia, I have had many conversations with growers and farmers who simply cannot find local people to do these jobs that keep their businesses, their farms and their horticultural industries going. Any opportunity like this to help growers and farmers across Australia find hardworking employees is something to be commended. Again, I cannot understand how anybody in this place would not think that is a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens to them after they have worked in regional Australia? If they have worked in regional Australia without requiring access to income support for 3½ years, they will be able to apply, if they meet eligibility requirements, to be granted other onshore visas—for example, family and skilled visas as well as temporary and skilled student visas. If a SHEV holder was to access government assistance to study for a degree, a diploma or a trade certificate in a designated regional area, this would not be classified as accessing social security benefits. However, holders of this visa will not be able to apply for a permanent protection visa. If a holder of a SHEV has relied on income support for more than 18 months during a five-year period, they will only be eligible to apply for another SHEV or a TPV, and this will only be granted if they are found to be engaging Australia's protection obligations. If they are not found to have engaged Australia's protection obligations, they will be required to leave the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments in this bill to the Maritime Powers Act strengthen Australia's maritime enforcement framework and the ongoing conduct of border security and maritime enforcement activities. These amendments also reinforce the government's powers and support for Australian border protection officers conducting maritime operations to stop people-smuggling ventures at sea. Enforced turn-backs are a critical component of the government's suite of border protection measures and have been successful in stopping the boats, stopping people dying and putting people smugglers out of business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures affirm and strengthen our government's ability to continue with the successful cessation of boat arrivals in Australia. As someone with firsthand experience with border protection policies, I know the effectiveness of stopping the boats. They are not easy decisions. They are probably some of the hardest decisions that any government has to take, but they have to be made in the national interest and, I must say, in the interest of those who are thinking of putting their lives at risk by paying people smugglers, and now in the interest of the 30,000 illegal maritime arrivals whose lives will be held in limbo under the policies of this government for nearly seven years if this legislation does not go through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The migration system as it stands promotes a one-size-fits-all approach to responding to other claims. The framework is inconsistent with the robust protection system that promotes efficiency and integrity. While efficiency and integrity are buzzwords used in government and in business, what that actually means for those 30,000 people is that they will have to wait for up to seven years in limbo, and that is not acceptable. Under this bill, a new process, the fast-track assessment process, will efficiently and effectively respond to unmeritorious claims for asylum and, it has to be pointed out, there are many unmeritorious claims for asylum just as there are many that are meritorious. This new fast-track assessment process will replace access to the Refugee Review Tribunal with access to a new model of review—the Immigration Assessment Authority, known as the IAA. These measures are specifically aimed at addressing the current backlog of illegal maritime arrivals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard during our Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee hearings on this, 30,000 people are affected. Those who have meritorious claims will be afforded far better treatment under the provisions of this bill. However, it is the government's policy that, if fast-tracked applicants present unmeritorious claims or have protection elsewhere, their cases will be channelled towards a direct immigration outcome, rather than having them access the merits review process in order to prolong their stay in Australia. The measures in this bill will support a robust and timely process, which is, as I said, the humanitarian and the right process. It will better prioritise and assess claims, and afford a differentiated approach depending on the characteristics of the claims. Prompt removal of failed asylum seekers from Australia also supports the integrity of our protection program and reduces the likelihood of applicants deliberately frustrating and playing the system, and delaying removal plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of the former Labor government's failures on our border over the last six years of government have been substantial in both humanitarian and financial terms. When looking at this bill and these measures, it is, I think, very important to go back and have a look at what they are designed to address. Labor and the Greens' failed border protection policies resulted in an environment where 50,000 people put their lives and their families' lives at risk by paying people smugglers, working through a pipeline of countries, to make this illegal journey. And why did they do it? Because those opposite deliberately, knowingly and with foresight implemented policies that drew them back to our country. Again, as I have said, I see no compassion in any government that would deliberately do that—not only deliberately bring them here in large numbers but put them into detention centres that were not ready and were not capable of looking after that many people. That is not compassion. That is not humane. Trying now to obstruct legislation that would deal with these 30,000 people in less than the seven years that their system would have taken—that is not the humane or right way to treat these 30,000 human beings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence of the policies of those opposite, more than 14,800 have been waiting offshore in very desperate circumstances. Because of the policies of those opposite, they have been denied Australia's protection through humanitarian visas, as places were taken in our program by those illegal maritime arrivals who had paid to come here—many of whom had paid and sent their children on that journey so that the whole family could come in behind them. That is in no way a humanitarian or a responsible government approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, the most compassionate and humanitarian approach is to pass this legislation to give these 30,000 human beings a decision. If they are not going to stay, it is the right thing to do to tell them so they can get on with their lives elsewhere. If they are able to stay, we should provide them with visas so that they can work, study and raise their families here. That is the humanitarian way. Do not leave them in detention for up to seven years. That would be the consequence of not passing this bill, which I commend to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  In rising to support the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014, I support the comments of those who have come before me, particularly those of Senator Reynolds in the last few minutes. I will be urging, from a humanitarian point of view, everybody in the chamber to support this legislation. I do want to reflect initially, if I may, on why we are where we are, because I think it is important for people to have some understanding of the history of this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the previous coalition Prime Minister, Mr Howard, dealt with this issue. He of course made the statement that we, Australia, would decide who comes to our country and the circumstances under which they come. It was interesting for me, not long after I came here some six years ago, to hear a comment by the honourable Philip Ruddock, whom Mr Howard appointed as the immigration minister. Coming from his legal background, particularly associated with supporting those in need, one might have thought that Mr Ruddock's view would be very much along the lines of: 'What can we do to encourage more to come?' The interesting point he made was this: 'I came to the realisation that the best way of protecting these would-be asylum seekers who would come by sea under circumstances in which they are encouraged by people smugglers was to make sure that they didn't get on boats in the first place.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Philip Ruddock took the view that the safest position for those people was to make sure they were not put on old wooden leaky hulks, having paid significant, indeed scandalous, sums of money to people smugglers. So Ruddock went about the process of making sure that that took place. History of course records that that is what the Howard government achieved. At the time, the shadow minister  for immigration was Ms Gillard. Ms Gillard used to have a press release. The press release was headed: 'Another boat, another policy failure.' It got to the stage that her staff or their printers were not troubled by that media release, because they stopped when the vessels stopped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember, before meeting Philip Ruddock—Senator Cash would recall as well—watching him being interviewed by a very aggressive BBC interviewer in London. This man was being highly critical and highly rude, and Philip Ruddock in his usual quiet way listened to this fellow for awhile and then said to him, 'Why are you attacking our country when you yourselves have exactly the problem that we did have?' He said, 'The only difference is we have addressed it and you haven't.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when the Rudd government came into power, the first thing they did was dismantle the processes, practices, procedures and legislation that had stood the test of time with the Howard government. As one who had recently worked in and had businesses in Asia, on the subcontinent and in the Middle East, it became apparent to everybody that the message to the people smugglers was: 'We're back in business. We can put our sign up again because once again Australia is a weak target.' So what we saw in that time was the lamentable circumstance of tens of thousands of people paying hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively to people smugglers to get on leaking boats for the possibility of making it to Australia or to one of our offshore islands.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in excess of 50,000 people got on those more than 800 boats. We know about 1,100 people—about one every second day that Labor was in government between 2007 and 2013 that we know about—were lost at sea. Why do I emphasise that point? I return to some discussions with our naval personnel with whom I had the pleasure and privilege of visiting at the Larrakeyah Barracks as part of Sovereign Borders in July of this year. For those in the gallery who may not be aware: we have this wonderful program between the parliamentarians and the Australian Defence Force where we—there are 14 of us each year—can participate in a program with our Defence Force personnel. We are given no privileges. We meet everybody from the cooks to the generals to the admirals. We have the opportunity to learn from them at the coalface what their activities are, where their challenges lie. For their sins the military officers come and spend a week with us in Parliament House in September or October.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A circumstance played out last night on national television. That was the stress to naval personnel who have been associated with the illegal-boat-led immigration programs over the last few years. The small amount of footage that I saw was distressing. But the point they made to me was they were sure there were well in excess of 1,100 people who would have been lost at sea. They are the ones that we know about. One can only be open in admiration of the work that those naval and related Army personnel do in protecting our borders but also in offering assistance to those who used to come. They were stressed out because of increased workload. The vessels were certainly stressed out because of increased workload.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the worst thing of all for them was that recently our national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ran a line that our naval personnel had forced the hands of asylum seekers onto hot engine parts on those vessels. You had better have a clear understanding of their anger and their disappointment that such an allegation would be aired on a publicly funded national broadcasting service. I for one praised the Minister for Defence and others who drew attention to the scandalous allegation that was made and which has never been fully retracted, with a half-hearted apology from the head of the ABC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's reflect on what has happened since Minister Morrison, ably assisted by his assistant minister, Michaelia Cash, took over responsibility for this portfolio. Since December last year—about this time—there has been one people smuggling venture, associated with 157 personnel. Only the one. Prior to that time, as we know, from September 2012 to September 2013—prior to us coming into government—there were no fewer than 401 such ventures, with 26½ thousand people on board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw attention to the plight of genuine refugees—those who have gone through the process, those who have been found to actually be eligible for refugee status in this country who have been left floundering and rotting in refugee camps around the world as a result of the previous Labor government's policies. And why were they? Because Australia would accept a certain number per year. For each illegal immigrant—each illegally sourced asylum seeker who came—a genuine refugee then continued to rot with their families in refugee camps. I recall in Perth a young Sri Lankan fellow coming to see me, telling me that what was happening in these refugee camps was that, as a family got to the top of the list to come to Australia, unbeknownst to them, as a result of graft and corruption by management of some of these refugee camps, they never got to find out their names got to the top of the queue. Why? Because somebody came along with the inevitable brown paper bag, paid money, went to the top of the queue, came to Australia and had the deserving family continue to rot in such circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted to learn that the minister has indicated that we are now back to the stage of accepting some, I believe, 13,500 genuine refugees each year. On top of that, the people who will be the subject of this legislation are actually additional to those numbers. This is critically important—they are additional. So we will see again the flow of genuine refugees coming to this country under the conditions we have always approved and want to see in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the direct cost—the $11 billion of cost—that the previous government ran up because they discontinued the policies of the Howard government that they inherited and that were working; it is what they then did when trying to account for some of those costs. The problem was compounded because they cut nearly 700 staff from the Customs service at a time when their duties were being increased as a result of not just illegal boat arrivals but also the burgeoning importation of drugs into this country. Only the other day we saw our border protection, customs, police and related services apprehend some $1.5 billion worth of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not for a minute think that we are getting all that is coming into this country, but when you cut the guts out of the customs and immigration service—when you take 700 competent people out—what does that do to the drug cartels? It has been put to me that the drug trade is so lucrative that they say to the drug mules and others in the trade, 'If you get apprehended, we will replace the product free of charge.' Those are the challenges we are facing. The number of sea cargo inspections under the Labor government decreased by 25 per cent and there has been a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo inspections, so the chances now of being apprehended if you bring something in by air are not high. These are some of the spin-offs that occur when you end up squandering $11 billion when you inherited a situation that was under control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now come to the circumstance of this legislation directly. Temporary protection visas do exactly as their name suggests. If somebody comes to this country and returning them to their country of origin would put them at risk, they will be provided with a temporary protection visa. Wonderful. Over time, as we know, the conditions that caused them to have to leave their country, if they were the genuine asylum purposes, may change or can be the subject of examination and inspection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of the fairest components of the legislation we are considering, and the one I urge my colleagues in this place to support, is the capacity for a person during the time they are under a temporary protection visa to be provided access to Medicare and social security benefits and allowed to work. A lot of people in our community do not agree with that. We get email traffic that says: 'Why is the Australian taxpayer providing Medicare services for these people? Why are we providing social security benefits?' There are a number of reasons: firstly, we are generous people; secondly, we want to try to minimise the adverse impacts on these people; and, thirdly, we want to give them the dignity that goes with the capacity to work. How terrible it must be, for whatever reason and in whatever circumstances, for a person who comes to this country to be left rotting and not be able to work because they were not processed by the previous government, which had no sense of generosity and no capacity for administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a person from a rural and regional background I support the comments of my colleague Senator Reynolds with regard to work in rural and regional areas. At this very moment where fruit and other crops are being harvested we have a shortage of labour because Australians are unwilling to leave their towns and cities to avail themselves of this work. Fruit is not being picked and is rotting on trees and vines, and grain is not being harvested. Here we have a tremendous opportunity for these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element of Minister Morrison's legislation is the safe haven enterprise visa. This is a visa for a five-year period. If holders of these visas have worked in regional Australia without requiring income support for 3½ years and if they meet the eligibility requirements, they will be able to apply for other onshore visas—family, skilled, temporary skilled and student visas. What a fantastic opportunity. We all know from our own experiences how quickly those who came in post the Second World War from Southern Europe—Italians, Greeks and others—assimilated into our communities and how we benefited from their involvement. We then had the later wave during and after the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese who have come to this country have enriched this country with their diligence, their hard work and their desire to study and improve themselves, and of course they have changed our cuisine and our outlook on life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here under this legislation we are giving those people who will accept and be involved in the safe haven enterprise visa the chance, should they work for 3½ years—which is what they want to do; they do want to do the work that so many Australians do not seem to want to do—of family and skilled visas as well as temporary skilled and student visas. So they can set themselves up with sets of skills that indeed at the conclusion of that time they may well be able to take back to their country of origin, if indeed that is where they return, so that of course their lives and the lives of their children are enhanced into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation certainly requires a circumstance that people do make sure that they comply with Australia's rules and regulations. Perfectly, the Australian community would expect, that if a person on whatever form of these or whatever form of activity in this country, if they cannot comply with the rules of this country, if they cannot comply with reasonable legislation in this country, then they should be denied their right to continue here. I think that is an entirely reasonable circumstance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in the last few minutes I do want to go back to the humanitarian activity and I do want to return to the topic briefly associated with our own military personnel. It is and has been an enormous burden. When we were in Darwin they actually asked us to put the clothing on that the personnel wear when they get into the rubber duckies to actually go to the vessel that they will be intercepting, remembering what temperatures would be like and humidity is like this time of the year. They will be in that equipment for six to eight hours, apprehensive, tentative, not knowing what they are going to meet when they arrive at the vessel. This is a pressure that they endure day after day. I for one want to say how pleased and proud I am of those people. I also want to say that this type of legislation will limit even more quickly and even more severely those who attempt—people smugglers—to bring people to this country illegally.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>): Australia's migration policies have always had a long and vexed history. They have been, and rightfully so, open to significant scrutiny from international and domestic courts, independent experts, interest groups and the electorate. It has and will continue to be a passionate debate about a wicked and vexed issue. For me it is always important, always, to remember that we are dealing with legislation that relates to people, our fellow human beings. They are not numbers; they are not the myriad of labels that have been applied to them by all sides of the debate; and they are not political inconveniences, punching bags or props. They are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, friends, neighbours and acquaintances. They are, in short, people just like you and me who have found themselves in extraordinarily difficult circumstances—some, unimaginable circumstances. So I would like to approach this debate with respect, with compassion and with dignity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has not been an easy process for me. On one side this bill does contain a number of measures that I am not comfortable with. But on the other side, if we do not act, the 30,000 people currently awaiting processing will continue to be left in limbo. If this bill does not pass there is also the real risk that the government will use a nonstatutory process instead, which will not result in any better outcomes for the people who are currently in Australia. This problem is a true Hobson's choice: we are left to decide between two potentially negative outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2012 the former government put up a number of proposals, the so-called Malaysia solution, which was rejected by the then opposition and the Australian Greens. I remember at the time—I remember well—I was in hospital and I asked for my vote to be recorded. There is a saying: 'Not to have the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.' As imperfect as the former government's solution was, it was preferable to doing nothing. We saw more and more drownings, more and more people pass away, and more and more people fall victim to people smugglers and the awful consequences of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is being proposed by the government here is by no means perfect—in fact, it is quite imperfect—but the consequences of not supporting it will mean that asylum seekers will be in a worse position, in my view. It also has to be noted what the immigration minister said a few moments ago. He has agreed, as part of a process of constructive engagement with crossbenchers, to increase the humanitarian intake by 7,500 people—a significant increase. My view is that we should double the humanitarian intake or more. We are a big country with a big heart. But I am trying to deal with the actual political realities here. We have an opportunity to increase significantly the humanitarian and refugee intake by 7,500 people on top of the 30,750 per annum. We have an opportunity to have something like 25,000 people on bridging visas have work rights for the first time. We have an opportunity to significantly improve the lot of those individuals who have been left in limbo. The reality is that under the former government border control, immigration policy, was out of control, and that is something we need to take into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with many interest groups and representatives, including Amnesty International and also Paris Aristotle of Foundation House and the former government's expert panel. My view on this issue changed when I saw what Angus Houston, Paris Aristotle and Michael L'Estrange said in that expert panel. I congratulate former Prime Minister Gillard for having the foresight to set up that panel—to actually have a circuit breaker to try to look at this in a different way, because to me it meant that we needed to consider the awful moral dilemmas that we had to deal with. I thought the panel headed by Angus Houston came up with a number of sensible proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, I have approached the government to request changes to the bill and to migration policy to improve the conditions for the men, women and children who are awaiting processing. That doesn't mean that we cannot still advocate for a significant increase in the humanitarian intake. It does not mean that we stop being critical of the government's policies, but if we do nothing, if we do not support this bill, then I believe fervently that what will happen is that asylum seekers will be worse off if this bill is not passed, as imperfect as this bill is. That is the moral dilemma; that is the wicked problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it clear that my vote for this bill is conditional on these changes and those circulated by the Palmer United Party. The government has taken my concerns into account and, I understand, will be circulating amendments to that effect. As such, I will not speak to those amendments in detail, but I would like to take this opportunity to outline the changes that I have proposed. I also want to make it very clear that these proposals do not necessarily represent my ideal outcomes. They do not, but they do make important steps forward—and I do not believe they should be rejected because they are only 'good' rather than 'perfect'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I have proposed changes to allow people holding TPVs or SHEVs to travel outside Australia where the minister is satisfied there are compassionate or compelling circumstances and the minister has approved that travel. That has never occurred before, either under this government or under the previous government, and I think that is an important concession. This would cover circumstances where a TPV or SHEV holder wants to travel to visit family in circumstances such as significant family illness or death. While I would prefer to allow family reunification on these visas, I believe this is an important step in granting these visa holders rights that go some way towards acknowledging the importance of family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I have proposed changes to ensure that, through the use of a disallowable instrument, the fast-track process only applies to the legacy caseload. This will make sure that the use of this fast-track process will be subject to the scrutiny of the Senate. Thirdly, I have proposed changes to the definition of 'manifestly unfair' in relation to the rejection of claims so that it more accurately reflects language used by the UNHCR—and that is important. I think that is a benchmark that we need to look at very carefully. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, I have proposed some changes to the fast-track review process to ensure that it is not only efficient and quick but must meet the natural justice provisions already included in the Migration Act. This will help to ensure that decisions take natural justice into account within the confines of the act and so are more balanced and fair. I have also proposed changes to the requirement for the review to take new information into account. My specific intention in this case is to ensure that information that was not provided for personal reasons, including mental health reasons, can be taken into account. One example that has been put to me are the many cases of sexual or other assault, where the victim may not volunteer that information in the first instance. I think all of us can appreciate the reasons behind not sharing that information—the shame and the trauma that may prevent someone from speaking out. My proposal to the government was that this type of information and these circumstances must be taken into account, and I believe these changes will improve the review process in that regard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifthly, I have raised concerns relating to the non-refoulement provisions and how we can be sure that a person being returned to a country is not facing persecution. In this case the government has agreed to use phrasing similar to that of the UNHCR to define both when a person is considered to be part of a particular social group and what effective protection measures should be taken into account when considering if that person should be returned. I believe these definitions will bring Australia more in line with UNHCR best practice in terms of defining and applying these clauses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, I have advocated, as have others, for an increase in Australia's humanitarian intake and to extend work rights to people on bridging visas. I have always been a strong advocate of increasing our humanitarian intake. I believe the government could go further, but I do acknowledge the increase they have proposed will make a real difference—7½ thousand people. That is 7½ thousand people who can be taken in through that humanitarian and refugee intake and who can be part of our community. I do not want to throw that away. That does not mean that my colleagues in the Australian Greens or the opposition cannot say that we should double it—I think we should—or that we should have a much bigger humanitarian intake, a much bigger refugee intake. It could be an issue at the next election. I do not have an issue with that—it ought to be. But I do not want to throw away this opportunity to have 7½ thousand more people come in to this country through that humanitarian and refugee intake process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extending work rights to those on bridging visas is also vitally important. Participating in the workforce, even in a small way, makes people a part of our community and society. It gives them, quite simply, a reason to get up in the morning—to feel valued and that they are making a contribution. I do not want to pretend that any of these measures is an ideal outcome or that they represent what I would see happen in the perfect world. But they will make a true difference to the people who are here right now, who are in detention right now, who are waiting to be processed right now. This may not be perfect, but it is good. It is also important to remember that this is not the end of the debate. These measures do not mean that I, as many others, will stop pushing for improvements. They are merely the next step, not the final one, and I would urge my colleagues to support this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  The Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 makes significant changes to the way asylum seekers in this country are processed. With amendments, the bill is even more complex than without. The bill will do many things, not least of which is the bringing back of TPVs. As I understand it, the government will not back down on their view in support of TPVs, and I have a problem in backing down on my view against them. As such, I think we are, at this point in time, possibly at a stalemate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want people to be crystal clear that I genuinely want to find the solution to the problem of asylum seekers and what they are experiencing. Having visited Villawood and Broadmeadows on a number of occasions, I know that these people wish to have some surety in their lives. I also know that many of them will be found to be genuine refugees and that there will be some who will be found, ultimately, not to be genuine. I personally think the whole debate has become so polarised. I am not casting aspersions on anybody's motivations here but just asking people to remember that we are all going to go home at the end of this week. We are all going to be with our families </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know where we are going, so to speak. The issue of asylum seekers, the issue of dealing with compassion and dignity, the issue of addressing the concerns of people in the wider Australian community have to be treaty logically and with respect. There are many moving parts to this machine but in the end it is about people and you cannot commodify people. They are not numbers; they are people. At this point, I cannot support the government's legislation as it stands, but I acknowledge the work of Senator Xenophon. There are a lot of people in this place who are looking for a genuine and a just outcome.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  This is the first time in this place I have had the opportunity to speak on any refugee or immigration matters. At the outset, I would like to associate myself with the sentiments put on the record by Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan. We do have a moral obligation to do what we can to accept people who are in unfortunate positions, who do not have the grace and benefit of being born in the safe and democratic nation in which we were born. We try to do the best in the world, as we do in our own lives, to help as many people as we can. I know often I personally fall down in not giving charity to as many fellow Australians as perhaps I should from time to time. Likewise, as a nation I am sure we can do more from time to time, we but we cannot do everything. The problem of refugees or displaced people has existed for as long as human history itself, going right back to biblical times. As a small nation at one end of the Pacific, we simply cannot fix that problem. We can, however, contribute to helping a not insubstantial number of people to relocate to a new nation, to make a new life, and to give them the opportunity to escape from threats to their life and liberty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through my own experiences, although I have not had a lot to do with refugee issues, I have from time to time been in contact with the Hazara community in Brisbane. They are great Australians who have come to this nation in the last decade or so, have found work and made themselves a family, and have taken advantage of the great Australian dream which we offer to everyone who is born here. It is a fantastic thing we can also offer to people from all around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We try to take in around 13,500 refugees a year, which is a high proportion of the population relative to other nations' takes. It is something I fully support. In the past few years, that intake has been breached largely through unauthorised arrivals by boat. While I support an open and welcoming refugee policy where we do not control who is coming to this nation, I have great concern that those refugee places are not necessarily going to the people most in need across the world. They go to the people most able to afford to get on a boat or have access to places like Indonesia where they can take advantage of people-smuggling activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There certainly needs to be a change in policy and a recalibration of where we are at. This bill deals with the legacy of policies which have contributed to the fact that we have 30,000 people in migration limbo at the moment, people who came here in an unauthorised way, and we have no real system to process those individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I think we have a moral obligation to help people. We do not have a moral obligation because we have signed international treaties or because other people tell us we should act in that way; we have that obligation because we are human beings, just as these people are human beings and we should try our best to make their lives better if we can. The changes we are making in this bill have the potential to improve the lives of the 30,000 people. I know others in this chamber do not support temporary protection visas, but I think they are a reasonable compromise between ensuring people have asylum from threats which might impact them in their home countries, while recognising that we cannot help everyone in that situation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over time, if the temporary protection visa system works well, we could help more people than we could if we were to offer permanent asylum because there is a limit to the number of people we can take. While I believe we have the obligation to provide people with asylum, it does not extend to say that we have to provide them with permanent residence, only that they should be granted asylum in the period when they need asylum. If circumstances change in their home countries, I see no abrogation of our responsibilities if we ask them to return to their home country when the situation improves. In fact, in my view we do the home countries a disservice if we do not encourage people to go home in those circumstances. We have been involved in fighting a long and hard war in Afghanistan. While I see the need for the Hazara to have asylum, hopefully in the long  term Afghanistan will find a  modicum of peace and security and the Hazara people will be integral to building peace and stability in that nation. If all we do is take the good people out of a nation and provide them with asylum, then those other countries will be denuded of those good people and will struggle to rebuild their own nations and to fight against evil and tyranny that sometimes, unfortunately, temporarily succeeds in other countries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing temporary protection is, to me, quite consistent with our obligations, and a temporary protection visa has always seemed to me to be a reasonable and proportionate response to this very difficult issue. Of course, the policy changes I flagged earlier have made a marked difference in the number of boat arrivals in this country. There has been only one people-smuggling venture that has successfully arrived in Australian waters since 19 December 2013—almost a year ago—and with only 157 people. That compares with the 50,000 or so that arrived here under the former government, and that has meant that we have a backlog of 30,000 people in asylum right now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government went to an election last year with a clear policy—indeed it has been to the last two elections with a clear policy—to implement changes to our refugee program. The changes have included a program of turning back boats where it is safe to do so, reopening the facilities on Nauru and Manus Island—which the former government did take steps to do before the election—and, of course, the reintroducing temporary protection visas. I think there was a very clear mandate at the last election and widespread support for those policies, and some components have been successfully implemented by the government and have clearly had an impact. As I said earlier, I recognise the concerns of other senators about temporary protection visas, but it seems to me to be a reasonable compromise in this very fraught debate and I would hope that particularly those senators who come from an independent or crossbench perspective will look closely at this compromise and consider it to be a reasonable alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give credit to some of the crossbench and government senators who have introduced a new element to this program. I think that the safe haven enterprise visa, as it has been called, is an extremely innovative and welcome development. We have other visas in this nation which are very beneficial to rural and regional areas; indeed, some of our farms, meatworks and agricultural enterprises would not survive without 457 visas or 417 visas, the holiday visa program. These are essential to providing a workforce for industries in so many areas where unemployment is high. Unfortunately, many Australians do not want to go and pick fruit at a farm, pick grapes in St George or cut down 14-kilogram banana trunks in Innisfail or Tully, and we do rely on getting people from other nations to sustain those industries and farming activities. The enterprise visa will add another menu item to those visas which I think would be quite beneficial. People among those 30,000 who are in that backlog who want to gain access to work can move to an area of need—although I recognise that any area can be designated a region, my understanding is that the government will seek to ensure that those regions are in need of employment and are designated accordingly. People could apply to get a safe haven enterprise visa and move to these areas to add a new source of dynamism and diversity to regions of Australia which need workers, and it would allow these people to get on with their lives and earn some money for their families so that they can afford all the things that we in this chamber, I am sure, are very lucky to be able to afford.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safe haven enterprise visas would be temporary in nature but my understanding is that after 3½ years on those visas people would be able to apply to be granted other onshore visas, including family-related visas which would not normally be allowed under TPVs generally. This will provide those people in this queue with hope for a better life. If we pass this bill today, it will provide 30,000 people who are somewhere on our territory, or territory that we have contracted for in Pacific nations, to have a hope for a better life. They can get some form of visa right now. They can apply for rights to work and to provide for their families, and if they prove themselves to tick all the right boxes while undertaking those activities, working and paying taxes, they will be able to become fully-fledged Australians. I think that is a great thing, and I am surprised that it is all that controversial in this place. Why wouldn't we want to give some portion of these 30,000 people hope for a better life? That is what this bill will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is of a view that a one size fits all approach is not appropriate to this problem because it limits our ability to address and remove unmeritorious claims and diverts resources away from individuals who have more complex claims. This bill will introduce a fast-track assessment process that will efficiently and effectively respond to claims that are deemed to have no merit and will replace access to the Refugee Review Tribunal with a new model of review—the immigration assessment authority, known as the IAA. These changes are consistent with the other issues that have been raised with respect to the surge in boat arrivals that have occurred in the last few years that has, in my view, given priority to people who perhaps are not as much in need as those who are waiting in camps—those who are in a queue, so to speak—waiting to get to a nation of asylum, whether it be Australia or another country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our review processes likewise have been blocked and unnecessarily diverted from dealing with claims that are of more merit by those that would seek to abuse processes. However, I completely understand why people might want to do that. I must say, if my family were living in Iran or another nation, I would try to do everything I could to get my family out and to a better life. As I said at the start, we cannot do everything. That does not mean we do nothing but we need to do something that we can do, and we need to do it in the best possible we can, given the scarce resources and the constraints that we have as a nation, and it needs to be consistent with our obligations in this place. This bill does that. It gives people better opportunities and it should be supported by this chamber.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I would like to talk today about something which should concern all governments of all persuasions in the Western World and all their constituents. Can I just start by outlining what we see for the future: by 2050, there will be nine billion people on the planet, and 50 per cent of them will be poor for water. Ninety-seven per cent of the world's water is actually sea water; three per cent of the world's water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that is tied up permanently in snow and ice. Two-thirds of the world's population by 2050 will be living in the Asian area; 30 per cent of their productive capacity will be gone; about 1.6 billion people on the planet will possibly be displaced. That is the challenge for the planet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for the human race of course is the low intake of antibiotics in the food chain—and bacterial resistance—the great challenge for feeding humanity. We do not have a solution to the global food task. By 2070, barring human catastrophe—there is always that caveat—there will be 12 billion people on the planet. China itself will have close to two billion people and will have to have an organisational concept to feed half their people from someone else's resources. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next great challenge for the Western world and the world to which we have become accustomed in its sovereignty is capturing the revenue base, which is really where I want to go today. I have to say that we are not even noticing the cost that we are going through and the revenue leakage we are going through. We are taking it for granted that 'she'll be right', whether it is paying for the ABC or paying for whatever governments expect—schools and public hospitals—although there are some exceptions to that. Senator Leyonhjelm does not think we should have public schools and public hospitals. I happen to think we should. We are not even noticing revenue leakage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the World Bank estimated we missed out on about $3 trillion involved in revenue leakage in the G20, which is mainly the Group of Eight nations. And most of that is through derivative swaps and transfer pricing. The derivate swap market was about $700 trillion. The shadow banking market is 69 per cent of China's banking. And you wonder why they don’t put the currency on the market! These are serious issues which the electorate needs to be informed of, because what we should be doing—whoever is in government should be doing it—is modelling where we have come from in the last 20 years and modelling where we are going in 20 years time if we do not change the law to catch up with the times in capturing our revenue base. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 is completely out of date. It does not deal with how we capture revenue from sovereign investors. It needs to be redefined globally. Why does the Future Fund—and I noticed Peter Costello the other day saying 'Oops! Why would the Future Fund want 14 and now 17 companies in tax havens?' It is because they do not want to pay tax where countries still charge sovereign investors tax. Australia does not. A passive sovereign investor coming into Australia does not pay tax. A passive investor investing in investment and production in Australia, if they declare that production for humanitarian purposes, gets charitable status, for God's sake! So we have some serious issues. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety per cent of the world's economy is involved in G20 and the OECD countries. As a group of nations we should solve this, unless we want to be the generation that redefined sovereignty. I went to a bitcoin inquiry the other day and was just amazed that the people promoting it could not tell me whether it was defined as a commodity or a currency—and that included people on the phone from the US and the UK and some bright young people from Australia. Yet it is trading. To me, it aids and abets revenue leakage, so there is tax avoidance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I absolutely think that we have to come to terms with this. Last year the turnover of the shadow banking world was about $120 trillion, which is 1¼ times the global GDP. These are challenges that most people do not want to talk about. I noticed the US corporate world responded the other day—and congratulations to the government on their G20 approach and putting revenue leakage on the agenda—by saying, 'we don't think it's such a crime to have all this revenue leakage going overseas because they are creating jobs here'. That is alright if you do not want to have schools and hospitals and they leave you in the gutter if you get sick. But the US last year estimated they missed out on between $650 billion and $800 billion in tax that was avoided. In fact the largest anti tax-avoidance case last financial year was with an Australian identified company. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think it is time that we in the parliament took a responsible stand. There is an inquiry—I think there ought to be a select committee that looks at this—to model where we have come from and the things we have taken for granted. These people are not breaking the law; the law is out of date. We need to model where are we going to finish up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to finish up like southern Europe—or Greece or somewhere where they do not collect their taxes and they have no enforcement regime. The euro is the common currency—and southern Europe goes to sleep after lunch and northern Europe goes back to work—and they think the currency should be commonly denominated. These things need to be thought through. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned about the legal point-scoring that is occurring in Australia with things like whether we should have a $7 Medicare co-payment or not. All of these things are well and good to be debated politically but, if we do not solve the issue of having the revenue to pay for the expectations of the electorate, we are wasting our time. </span>

                  </a>  Thank you. This document is an article from 21 November 2014 in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">octor</span>. Lots of people would find it difficult to come to terms with a $7 co-payment; obviously lots of people could pay it. A packet of cigarettes is more, but not everyone smokes and not everyone buys a coffee every day. But there are places we can save money. Besides capturing our revenue base—and this is a serious problem which is going to redefine sovereignty if we do not fix it. There was $3 trillion in tax avoidance globally last year. This article points to where we could save some money:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Professional Services Review said it was concerned about high-end claimers, including one GP working in a large suburban practice who drew up more than 400 management plans, 400 team care arrangements and then billed for 1,300 reviews in the space of 12 months.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should put the politics aside. If we want to keep Australia the best place in the world to raise a family, to breathe fresh air and to drink clean water, for God's sake, let's get the politics out of the road. Let us not worry about what tomorrow's headline says or what the next election is going to be about. Let's look at what where we are going to be in 15 or 20 years' time as a nation. I do not want to be blamed for living through a period when our sovereignty was redefined because we did not allow the law to catch up with technology. When the present Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act was written in 1975, we were just barely past the telegram era—and a lot of our laws were written when it took six weeks for the Australian cricket team to go to England by ship. We really need to understand that we need to redefine where we are in the world if we are to maintain our sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the World Bank said there was about $1 trillion involved in bribes. You can get a signature on anything you like in Asia, as long as you find the right person to pay the bribe to. And the cost of those bribes—that is, the corruption that followed —was five per cent of global GDP. These are serious issues. It is a given these days that, to compete in the market, the big companies take as a given that they will pay little or no tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The average punter and certainly people listening to this—if there is anyone—would not know the derivative swap market. The derivative swap market is a serious deal as is the challenge of coming to terms with the bitcoin market, which will aid and abet tax avoidance, transfer, profits, drug laundering et cetera. So the great challenge for Australia—it does not matter who is in government—is to capture our revenue base. Let's first find out what is going wrong with what we are doing.</span>

                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Before the last election, in its broadband policy launch, the then opposition, now government, promised to deliver a National Broadband Network sooner than Labor and for less capital. Despite offering a second-rate broadband network, any savings the government might have achieved over Labor's network are marginal at best, and the rollout is proceeding at a snail's pace. It is ironic that the coalition's multi-technology mix was supposed to speed up the rollout of the NBN when in fact the switch to the new model has actually slowed it down, so much so that the government has already broken its promise to deliver speeds of 25 megabits per second to every premise by the end of its term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest rollout plan released by NBN Co last Monday shows that fewer than half of Australian households and businesses will be passed by the NBN over the next 18 months. NBN Co is now committing to have the remainder of premises connected to the NBN by 2020. This is despite the Prime Minister promising that all Australians would be able to get an NBN connection by the end of 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 10 weeks prior to the election, the NBN rollout was passing an average of 4,290 brownfields premises per week. Data released in August showed that the 10-week average had slowed to 2,707 premises per week. Despite promising to deliver the NBN faster, the rollout has slowed down since the election. So the Government's broadband rollout has come to a grinding halt, in fact, all for the sake of switching to technologies that will deliver a second-rate broadband network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National coalition continue to demonstrate, as they did before the election, that they just do not get it when it comes to Australians' need for broadband speed. The now Prime Minister, Mr Abbott said at the coalition's policy launch:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are absolutely confident that 25 megs is going to be enough, more than enough, for the average household.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Minister, it may be now, but I doubt it will be by the time your second-rate NBN is built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a world where the demand for broadband speed is roughly doubling every 18 months. The average household may not need 100 megabits per second now, but it will not be long before they do. Many other countries around the world are delivering fibre-to-the-premises broadband with speeds of 100 megabits per second or more. South Korea, which has the largest number of fibre connections per head of population, is delivering speeds of 1 gigabit per second and is set to unveil a service which provides speeds of 10 gigabits per second.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If coalition members and senators cannot imagine what anyone would need 100 megabits per second for then that is a failure of their imagination. And we have a Minister for Communications who clearly lacks imagination, because he seems to think that 25 megs is enough. In order to prove his point, Mr Turnbull paid his mates $2 million to produce a cost benefit analysis that favoured his broadband plan, even though he promised before the election to give this task to the independent Productivity Commission or Infrastructure Australia. The authors of the report included known critics of the NBN such as economist Henry Ergas, as well as former staff of the minister. Is it any surprise that they came up with the answers the minister wanted?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Minister Turnbull's cost benefit analysis, the median household in Australia will require a download speed of 15 megabits  per second by 2023. What makes this finding so absolutely ridiculous is that it suggests demand for broadband speed in Australia is actually going to go backwards. At the end of the last financial year, NBN subscribers were purchasing plans with an average download speed of 36 megabits per second. The report said that by 2023, only five per cent of Australians will want 45 megabits or more yet almost a third of households connecting to the NBN now are ordering plans of 50 megabits per second or more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that NBN plans, both wholesale and retail, are priced according to speed, so if households do not need 25, 50 or 100 megabits per second now why are they paying all that extra money for bandwidth they do not need? Or could it be that those opposite are such luddites that they do not understand what an important utility fast broadband is now, and is increasingly going to be into the future for households and businesses? 2023 is nine years away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider what broadband speeds were like back in 2005 and the applications that are available now that could not have been dreamed of then, and you will see how ridiculous it is to think that 15 megabits per second would be acceptable to an average household almost a decade from now. Even NBN Co CEO Bill Morrow thought that the report was rubbish. Mr Morrow said on Radio National in August, 'I suspect ... when they talk about 15 megabits per second being sufficient for people today, I think that likely is taking a snapshot in today's environment. What will tomorrow be, what will next year and the next decade require, I think is really the question. I think we need to ask the panel how they came up with the 15 megabits per second.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-benefit analysis not only understated the benefits of fast broadband it hugely overinflated the cost of delivering fibre to the premises. Documents leaked to <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> showed that changes in the construction model put in place by NBN Co's board and management last year resulted in fibre to the premises being delivered faster and cheaper than previously. The documents showed that fibre to the premises had been rolled out in Melton in Victoria 50 percent cheaper and 61 percent faster than in comparable suburbs. Given this fact, it is questionable whether there really will be any cost and time savings from the coalition's second-rate multitechnology mix model and that even if there are they would be marginal at best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no good reason for the government not to continue the fibre-to-the-premises rollout and deliver Australians the broadband they want and need and which will make our nation internationally competitive—no reason other than they are politically invested in their second-rate broadband plan and that it would be too embarrassing for them to admit that they got it wrong. Or maybe Minister Turnbull is just following his original orders from when Mr Abbott first appointed him as communications spokesman, to 'demolish' the NBN?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the fibre-to-the-premises rollout in my home state of Tasmania. Another broken promise on the NBN, one that is particularly galling to me as a Tasmanian senator, was the promise to 'honour existing contracts'. This is something Liberal members and senators, including Minister Turnbull and Senator Bushby, kept repeating prior to the last election in response to questions about whether Tasmania would receive the full fibre-to-the-premises rollout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that these were weasel words, designed to give the impression that the full fibre rollout in Tasmania would be delivered without them explicitly saying so. If that was not the impression those opposite were intending to give, why did they not correct TasICT chief executive, Dean Winter, when he said publicly that he took that to mean the full Tasmanian fibre-to-the-premises rollout would be delivered? In fact, Senator Bushby explicitly made the statement that he understood there to be contracts in place for the full fibre-to-the-premises rollout. On 17 August last year, Senator Bushby said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We understand that those contracts are in place to roll out right across the state, and if that is the case, we will honour that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, last night in a public hearing of the Senate NBN committee, at which I was present and asking questions, NBN Co's Chief Operating Officer, Greg Adcock, said that the contract with Visionstream was renegotiated around a number of elements, including price, technology and time lines. So, no matter what weasel words those opposite used then and continue to use now, they gave the clear impression to Tasmanians that the full fibre rollout would be delivered. Anything less is another lie and another broken promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forty-thousand premises in Tasmania were included in the fibre-to-the-premises rollout plan in July 2013. Contracts were in place to deliver fibre to these premises, and now most of these premises are being told they will only receive the second-rate multitechnology mix under the new rollout plan. This includes households and businesses in suburbs such as Risdon Vale, Claremont, Glenorchy, Margate, Brighton, Pontville, Cremorne and South Arm and, in the north of the state, Newnham, South Launceston, Prospect, Kings Meadows and Legana.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Tasmanians would have voted for the Liberal Party at the last federal election in the mistaken belief that they were committed to the full fibre rollout in Tasmania. It is modern infrastructure that would make Tasmania internationally competitive and deliver the jobs that our state so desperately needs—yet, once again, Tasmanians have been misled, betrayed and constantly lied to by this government. I will keep fighting for the hundreds of thousands of Tasmanians to get the broadband service they were promised and so richly deserve.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  Congratulations, Senator Bilyk! I just rise to make some quick observations on foreign minister Julie Bishop's comments over the last couple of days that if Australia were going to be dragged by the global community to make some kind of contribution to the task of decarbonising our economy then it was an obvious conclusion, in her view, that nuclear power would have to be brought into the energy mix. I would understand the reasoning behind Ms Bishop's statement to be that we now have 60 years of operating experience for a technology that provides utility-scale baseload electricity and, while carbon emissions from the back-end fuel chain behind fission reactors are certainly not zero, they are nonetheless a lot lower than for coal and gas. And these are quite reasonable prospects, I would add.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Ms Bishop thinks that building fission reactors in Australia is an obvious conclusion, she also did acknowledge—and I think this is very important—that there would have to be a public debate about the idea because, for a variety of reasons, other people have come to very different conclusions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have noticed that some people, particularly young people, are tempted by a lot of other positions to that taken by the Greens. They agree with us on a lot of our work, nonetheless they are perplexed as to why we are as opposed to nuclear energy and all elements of the nuclear fuel chain—from mining all the way through to weapons and waste—as we are. For example, it has come up in all of the AMAs that I have done and it comes up frequently on social media, and it has come up in response to some of my contributions over the last couple of days. It can come in one of two forms: one is simply, 'Why are the Greens against science? You listen to the global climate science community. Why do you not believe that nuclear energy could play a role in a balanced energy mix? That is one. I guess the other one is the sort of George Monbiot view of the world. He is somebody who takes climate change very seriously; he is steeped in climate science and the politics of climate change and he has come to the view—I do not think I have risked paraphrasing him too crudely—that we should 'just build anything: any low- or zero-carbon form of electricity should be on the table because the crisis that we face with the climate is that serious.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is to the people who would hold either of those views that I want to make some quick comments today. I want to push back, gently and respectfully, on the idea that people who have formed a view that nuclear energy would be a disaster in Australia, as it has been elsewhere, is a view that we formed purely on the basis of emotion, or the fact that we are scared of radiation, or that we have some kind of emotional or, as the Prime Minister said, 'theological opposition'. I do not have a theological opposition to nuclear power, or to much else; I have a very practical series of reasons for being opposed to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For decades the nations that have decided to go nuclear have relied on several varieties of uranium fission plants: in pressurised water reactors, boiling water reactors or—for a small number of nations, principally Canada and India—heavy-water CANDU reactors that do not require uranium enrichment. That is the fleet of reactors that we are stuck with—the kind of reactor that went up at Chernobyl, the kind of reactor that was catastrophically wrecked at Fukushima in Japan and the kind of reactor at the Three Mile Island plant; they are all first- and second-generation uranium fission reactors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By all means, let us have the debate. We have been having the debate in this country for nearly 60 years and there are very sound reasons why nuclear proponents keep losing that debate: it is not that the debate cannot be had or that we are proposing to censor their views; it is just that there are really sound reasons why they are not being built here and, in my view, why they simply never will be. Dr Ziggy Switkowski, at the behest of the Howard government in the last turn of the wheel in this debate, was the most recent person on the conservative side of politics who, reluctantly, was dragged to the inevitable conclusion that we need to decarbonise our electricity sector. The government said, 'The only form of electricity that seems to make sense is nuclear', so Dr Switkowski, in 2007, undertook his review for the Howard government. His conclusions broadly said that you would need—as cited by Bernard Keane in Crikey this week—a carbon price between $20 and $50 a tonne. Of course that level of carbon price means that to give nukes a step up because of how expensive they are, then you would obviously price in all the renewable energy competitors, which would very quickly run away and out compete nukes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the kinds of plants that are being built around the world and the catastrophic degree to which they are running behind budget and over cost. Flamanville, in France, was originally budgeted to cost $3.3 billion euros; by December of 2012, the cost had increased to $8.5 billion euros and the completion date blown out by five years. There are very similar stories elsewhere where third-generation plants are under construction or proposed for construction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to anybody who believes that opposition to nuclear energy is based solely on emotion or irrationality: just look at the data. A very good source for that is the <span style="font-style:italic;">World nuclear industry status report</span>. The most recent one was published a couple months ago by Mycle Schneider and Antony Froggatt. They have been publishing these for five or six years, and they are the best source of independent data on how the industry is tracking. The statistics are actually quite forbidding and they led me to the view, quite a few years ago, that globally the commercial nuclear industry is on its knees—not through any kind of ideological obstruction, although absolutely the global anti-nuclear movement has played its part, but mostly, or partly at least, on the grounds of cost. It is ruinously expensive to build in the kinds of redundant safety systems that you need to have a reasonable chance of a fissioning uranium reactor not blowing itself all over the landscape. Certainly the industry believes it has got better at it over recent decades, but that is one of the principle reasons why it is so expensive to build these plants: on a bad day entire regions can get depopulated—whether it is from a tsunami-earthquake combination, whether it is from a failed engineering experiment as was the case in Chernobyl or whether it is from faulty instrumentation or operator error as at Three Mile Island. If you cut the cooling systems from a fissioning reactor, you risk a meltdown which compromises the reactor's containment system and can then lead to the evacuation of hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of people. It is that serious. That is why these things are so expensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According the <span style="font-style:italic;">World nuclear industry status report</span>, the IEA—the International Energy Agency—cites:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… during 2000-13 global investment in power plants was split between renewables (57 percent), fossil fuels (40 percent) and nuclear power (3 percent).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is actually kind of over, and the opportunities are very, very rapidly dwindling for the industry to take off here in Australia. Part of the reason for that is that renewable energy technologies are quite simply eating them alive. They are small, fast, easy to deploy, cheap, much less labour-intensive and you can bring them onto the grid—either small distributive micro grids or fit them into large grids—much more easily than the multi-gigawatt scale of nuclear power plants. Again, this is not the Greens' view—although it is something that I am very strongly supportive of and optimistic about—this is just what the data says. The investment that is going into clean energy around the world compared to faltering and ultimately failing investment in nuclear really tells the story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who take issue with the Greens' objection to the current generation of nuclear power plants that have proven themselves basically to be obsolete say: 'What about what is coming next? What about thorium? What about molten salt? What about maybe even fusion plants? What about what might just be on the horizon? Why would you oppose those before you have even seen them tested?' Two things come to mind. Firstly, this technology does not exist yet. Nobody has built any of these things at anything approaching a commercial scale, despite tens of billions of dollars of development funding, so it is not through lack of trying. Optimistically these things are really decades away, if they could magically appear at all, and as anybody following climate science even peripherally will know we do not have decades. This challenge is upon us now, which is why it is all the more impressive seeing renewable deployment accelerating so rapidly and outpacing solar and nuclear. Secondly, I am not an engineer, but to me all of these sound like absurdly expensive and complex ways to boil water. With the probable exception of fusion plants, all of these exotic technologies do nothing more than bring water up to boiling point, making it hot enough to raise steam to spin a turbine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many reasons why we take these positions, one of them simply being the unavoidable weapons link. The reason why so much investment has been poured into nukes over recent decades is that the technology for enrichment, or fuel reprocessing, is precisely the same as the technology you need if you are enriching or reprocessing for nuclear weapons. That is why it is absurd to see our own Future Fund still very heavily invested in nuclear weapons—in it up to its neck, in fact. But also there is the fact that the Red Cross recently conducted a poll that indicated that eight of 10 Australians say it is time to ban nuclear weapons. I think we need to really take heed of the fact that popular opinion is very strongly against this technology as much as the markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also acknowledge that it is 30 years this week since former Senator Jo Vallentine was elected to this place on a platform of nuclear disarmament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I agree in part with Senator Ludlam. Although I have no theological opposition to nuclear power, it is too costly thanks to the bountiful and cheap sources of fossil fuel we have in this nation. But I take one issue. I understand why therefore we would not build nuclear in this nation, at least not at the moment given its cost, but I am not sure why we would not sell uranium to other countries who want to use it, even if that means a high-cost source of power for them. If they feel they would like to use higher cost sources of energy than we do, that is up to them. If we can make money selling them uranium, that should be great too. But I do not want to focus on negative things today. I think sometimes we focus on far too many negative things. I was reflecting on this the other day when I looked back at the speeches I have made in this place. I probably have spent too much time talking about debt, drought and why I don't like the Greens and all those sorts of things. But I want to talk about something more positive, Senator Ludlam. I want to be more positive today and I will try not to attack you too much!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do live in a very lucky country, as the saying goes. It is not perfect, but we are a very decent, strong and progressive nation. We are very, very lucky to live in a country that has now had 23 years of uninterrupted economic growth. That is something that we do not reflect on enough. It is the second longest period of uninterrupted growth in recorded world history, only beaten by the Netherlands after they discovered oil in the North Sea. Sometimes it is said that we are only lucky because others want to buy our coal and iron ore and that has contributed to it. It certainly has contributed, but only in the second half of that 20-year period has that been a major factor. In the first 10 or so years of this 23-year period, we had very low mining prices and low terms of trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we are able to enjoy this economic growth is because of our productivity. Productivity is the seed of all the fruit that we are lucky enough to reap in this country. Our ability to grow more food on less land with fewer workers lets others in our hospitals care for our sick, lets others teach our children, a few of us to create works of art and even fewer of us to give speeches in this grand place. In the early decades of the 20th century, agriculture accounted for around one-quarter of our total employment in Australia and produced just under one-third of our GDP. The Food and Agriculture Organization shows that wheat yields in developing countries have increased from around 800 kilograms per hectare in 1960 to in excess of 2,500 kilograms today. We have always had a problem feeding the world, but that has been massively made easier through better productivity. A culture without a productive economy has never produced high works of art and the more productive the economy the more resources are available to spend on the things in life that are not free but are the best things—our children, our art, our health, none of them are free. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best things in life are not free. They must be paid for and the only way to pay for them in the long run is by producing wealth. We have had a strong economy for the past two decades and we have produced much more wealth in that time. Two decades ago in about 1993, our economy was worth $783 billion a year—we produced that much wealth a year—or about $44,600 per person. Today, the economy is worth more than $1.5 trillion in size—so it has almost doubled—and we produce around $66,500 in wealth per person. That is a $22½ thousand difference in just 20 years. The sons and daughters of the workers of 20 years ago can now afford to buy a new car every year relative to their parents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the last two decades has been a tale of two halves, as I said earlier. The first decade was marked by strong productivity growth. I think it was about 1.2 per cent a year for the first 10 years—much higher than other countries in the world and much higher than our historical average. We benefitted from falling electricity prices in this period, increasing competition and less restrictive capital and labour markets. The second half of this period was also marked by strong economic growth, but the growth occurred in spite of negative productivity growth. From 2002 to 2013, multifactor productivity growth, which is a broad measure of productivity, grew by negative 0.2 per cent per year—a long way from the historical average of 0.7 per cent per year that we have achieved over the last 30 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only reason we sustained high levels of economic growth in such an environment was because of the growth in our terms of trade. A few years ago Glenn Stevens famously said that in 2005 a shipload of iron ore would buy about 2,200 flat-screen TVs. By 2010, that same shipload of iron ore could buy 22,000 flat-screen TVs. That was both because TV prices fell and because iron ore prices rose by a factor of six. Iron ore prices have fallen, so the picture is not quite as rosy today. These are my calculations not Glenn Stevens's, so take them with a grain of salt. By my calculations, a shipload of iron ore today would only buy around 11,000 flat-screen TVs. So we have half the wealth in iron ore that we had just four years ago, but, on the positive side, it is five times the purchasing power of 10 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher and higher prices for iron ore are not sustainable and if we want economic growth in the future we are going to have to have high productivity or increase the utilisation of our capital and labour. I want to focus on the productivity side of things in the remaining time I have today. Productivity growth is a powerful force because it is compound growth—it compounds year on year. So over the next decade if are able to grow our productivity at the same rate as our historical average, 0.7 per cent a year, over a 10-year period the average Australian would be $6,300 better off, just if we go back to our historical growth in productivity compared to the near zero levels of productivity growth that we have had in the past 10 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put that in a little context. We could probably all consider that $6,000. It is a lot of money. We spent a lot of time debating the carbon tax in this place and I think rightly so. It cost the average Australian around $300 a year. This debate on productivity could benefit Australians by $6,000 a year if we could achieve those goals. In some sense, this productivity challenge is 20 times more important than the removal of the carbon tax—20 carbon taxes put together. But we do not spend 20 times the time debating the issue. Productivity is a hard concept to get across but it is very, very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We spend a lot of time talking about the budget in this place—and, again, rightly so. We spend upwards now of nearly $400 billion of other people's money in this place each year, so it should take a considerable amount of our time and debate. But, again, productivity is actually very important to the overall budget debate even though it does not really feature in any of the budget papers, because our budget is a function not just of the $400 billion that we spend but how much that $400 billion is of the size of the pie. Right now, it is around 26.5 per cent of that pie. But, if we were able to maintain that productivity growth over the next decade—the historical productivity growth—without any budget cuts at all, our spending relative to GDP would fall from 26.5 per cent to 25 per cent, which is the historical average over the last 30 years. So without any budget cuts, if we just dealt with productivity and were able to lift that, we would go a long way to fixing our budget. It does not mean we would necessarily pay back the debt we have accumulated, but we would go a long way to dealing with the budget problems we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way we are going to do that is by focusing on areas that are going to deliver productivity growth. There is no silver bullet. There is no one policy or one piece of legislation which is going to fix everything. But we do need to focus on the things that got us to that strong level of productivity growth in the 1990s. We do need to get serious about reducing electricity prices. Again, the carbon tax is a component of that. But there are other things, like the renewable energy target, that lift electricity prices. Our network and access regulation needs reform, and the AER is looking at that at the moment. It is all those things. Lower electricity prices will mean that manufacturing will be stronger, there will be more jobs and we will achieve greater productivity in our businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at areas of our nation that we can invest in and get greater productivity out of those areas. I was up in the gulf region recently, on a cattle property. It produces around $2,000 a hectare in beef every year. But, if we were able to turn that into cotton production through irrigation, it would produce many, many times that. It would produce around $5,000 a hectare. It would be a great increase in productivity. I noticed a report in the paper today which says there are only four million hectares of irrigated land available in the north—only four million hectares! That is what it actually says. There are only two million hectares of land in the whole country that are irrigated right now. So that report is a bit like saying there were only 300 Spartans at Thermopylae. They did a pretty good job. If we were to irrigate four million hectares of land in Northern Australia, it would increase our productivity massively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we need to reform environmental approvals. Those delays are costing us. To get more productivity, we need to get big projects over the line.</span>

This year has of course been the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The year is about the international community acknowledging that what is happening to the Palestinian people is wrong. It is about highlighting the hope for a better world and the hope for peace in Palestine and Israel. Beyond hope, it is about agitating for a solution.</span>

It is only through cross-party support for a two-state solution, through cross-party opposition to the Israeli occupation, that the Australian government will be able to take a position of supporting Palestinian statehood—a position that is supported by 135 members of the United Nations General Assembly. Combined, these countries have a population of over 80 per cent of the world's population. Recently, the United Kingdom and Spanish parliaments also passed resolutions supporting recognition of Palestine. Last night, French law-makers voted in favour of recognising Palestine as a state. Australia is becoming an outlier—at odds with the global community. Australia needs to join with the international community in recognising the state of Palestine.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I reiterate my solidarity with the Palestinian people and recognise the tragedy of the current situation in the region. For too long, Palestinians have been denied their inalienable rights. Never has peace in the Middle East been a more urgent priority. The Palestinian people need to secure their rights to statehood, and Israel urgently needs peace and security. Never before have we so needed the international community to unite in support of a successful outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this year has brought some of the most violent and brutal events ever seen in the region. 2014 saw Israel's military operation entitled Protective Edge kill well over 2,000 Palestinians. Among the dead were more than 500 children. A further 11,000 were injured. Whole city blocks were wiped out. The health system was pushed to the brink of collapse, with the number of casualties far outstripping its capacity. UN schools and shelters were bombed, which I view as a blatant barbaric act and a very serious violation of international law. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Estimates by the Gaza health ministry, the United Nations and some human rights groups found that between 69 and 75 per cent of the Palestinian casualties were civilians. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported at the beginning of August that 520,000 Palestinians might have been displaced. To put this in an Australian context, this would be equivalent to the entire population of my home state of Tasmania and then some. More people than the entire state of Tasmania had their homes and neighbourhoods decimated. As a result of the 50 days of terror, these people have no access to shelter, water and to food. They are relying on the international community to provide emergency food, water, medicines and shelter, and the international community is struggling under the weight of the conflicts across the entire Middle East region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A major and ongoing impediment to the creation of a viable Palestinian state has been the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. These settlements are forcibly displacing Palestinian civilians through demolitions and the removal of residency rights. We need to recognise what an obstruction these settlements are to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The injustices that the Palestinian people have had to endure are unimaginable—and they must end. Labor supports a two-state solution as the only way that that justice can be achieved and stability can be built in the region. Clearly, the world must work towards supporting Israel and Palestine to find a way to live side by side in durable peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But recent legislative moves within the Israeli government seem to be moving in exactly the opposite direction. This month, we saw very disturbing moves to actively resist the two-state solution through the creation of the so-called Jewish State. While the idea of a Jewish state is not new, a recent draft bill which was approved by the Israeli cabinet goes much further. This bill seeks to define Israel as 'the nation state of the Jewish people' and to limit the rights of non-Jewish citizens to 'individual rights according to the law'. This is a move that would deny Palestinians national rights as a minority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Human rights groups warn that, if there is no express right to equality, and international law is excluded as a source for legislation alongside Jewish law, they will be powerless to challenge traditional interpretations that discriminate against non-Jews. Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are concerned that they will be subject to Jewish law. Many are worried that this move will see the end of a democratic Israel. This move can do nothing but worsen this tragic situation and inflame the tension. It certainly will do nothing to move Israel closer to peace and stability. Never have we needed more commitment from the international community to help ensure a successful outcome is achieved. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I rise today to talk about: the appalling rate of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples about Aboriginal deaths in custody and about those with cognitive impairment who are being held in indefinite custody in this country. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Overcoming Indigenous disadvantage</span> report, released last week, has highlighted the growing gap in incarceration rates in Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians made up only 2.3 per cent of the adult population but over a quarter of the adult prison population as at 30 June 2013. Between 2000 and 2013, the imprisonment rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults increased by 57.4 per cent, while the non-Indigenous rate remained fairly constant, leading to a widening of the gap. In 2012-13, the daily average detention rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people was around 24 times the rate for non-Indigenous young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is simply appalling and not enough has been done to address the issue, which is why so many people are calling for the establishment of justice targets to help provide a clear framework in which the federal government and state and territory governments can work with communities and peak Aboriginal organisations to look at how we address this appalling statistic and appalling failure of our system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's cuts to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs I deeply believe will only make the situation worse as we see critical services lose funding. At the moment, their futures are at risk, which undermines their ability to deliver their programs. There must be a commitment to fund critical legal services, advocacy services and community programs that help meet these justice targets. I was deeply disturbed when the minister refused last week to consider the issue of justice targets, which, as I said, community organisations had been calling for for a long time—including the close the gap campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the bright spots last week was the release of the Social Justice Commissioner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Social justice and native title report 2014</span>. While his report had some very distressing information in it, it was a bright spot because it is shining a light on the issue. The government—and everybody—needs to have a good read and take to heart what is said in that report. One of the comments that he made was around justice reinvestment. He said in that report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the past five years, it has been encouraging to see so many different people and groups embrace justice reinvestment. However, in all of this enthusiasm we have seen some confusion around what justice reinvestment actually involves. Some academics have warned of the potential pitfalls if justice reinvestment becomes a:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">'catch-all buzz word to cover a range of post release, rehabilitative, restorative justice and other policies and programs and thus lose both any sense of internal coherence and the key characteristic that it involves a redirection of resources.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In my view, it is not necessarily detrimental that advocates in Australia are already trying to adapt justice reinvestment for the Australian context. What works in the United States can be a powerful catalyst for action, but will require thoughtful adaptation to the Australian context. Nonetheless, if the Australian brand of justice reinvestment strays too far from the evidence we may lose some of the strength of this approach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is now a growing body of literature on justice reinvestment, so this chapter will only briefly summarise some of the key principles and processes of justice reinvestment to provide clarity and context.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Justice reinvestment is a powerful crime prevention strategy that can help create safer communities by investing in evidence based prevention and treatment programs. Justice reinvestment looks beyond offenders to the needs of victims and communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Justice reinvestment diverts a portion of the funds for imprisonment to local communities where there is a high concentration of offenders. The money that would have been spent on imprisonment is reinvested into services that address the underlying causes of crime in these communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My take on that is that we need to be investing in justice reinvestment, we need to make sure that we get it right and that it works, and we need to customise it for the Australian context. For too long, governments at the state, territory and Commonwealth levels have been sitting on their hands when it comes to justice reinvestment. We need to make sure that that is linked to justice targets, but it is a powerful way of addressing the issues that I have been talking about: the appallingly high rate of incarceration for both young and adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also cites an example of the Cowra justice investment program and talks about some of the progress that has been made there. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Participation in the project by the Cowra community has enabled the team to identify issues underlying the incarceration of its young people. Specifically, community groups and organisations have been consulted throughout the project to assist in identifying effective alternatives to prison which ought to be invested in, such as holistic and long-term initiatives, and better integrated services. Young people will also be interviewed about their experiences and suggestions for change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the important programs that we do need to be investing in. Cutting legal services and cutting other essential funding—half a billion dollars out of funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—is not going to help these types of projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, you cannot talk about incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples without talking about deaths in custody and the alarming number of Aboriginal people who have died in custody since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, let alone the number of people who died before the royal commission. The majority of the 339 recommendations made by the commission have not been implemented. Again, I need to raise in this place the death of Miss Dhu, a 22-year-old who died in custody in Western Australia in August. Miss Dhu was not sentenced to a custodial term; she was fined, and it was because of nonpayment of fines that she ended up in prison and died in prison. This has to stop. In this country, we need to address the issue of deaths in custody and not pretend that, just because we had a royal commission, all of a sudden it is solved. All levels of government need to show leadership in the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and to develop programs that address the unacceptably high rate of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We need meaningful action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that I would like to raise about incarceration is the indefinite incarceration of people with cognitive impairments. Predominantly, this affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is simply unacceptable in modern Australia to indefinitely hold in custody people who have not been found guilty of a crime or sentenced to prison. Many of the people who we are talking about have been found unfit to stand trial. What happens is that, instead of making sure that we then look after these people, we put them in maximum security prison—some are not in maximum security prison, but a lot are—indefinitely. This is happening around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Western Australia, last year there were 37 people with what was termed a mental impairment being held indefinitely in Western Australia. We have obligations under various conventions to make sure that we look after people with a disability. We also, obviously, have signed up to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It is unacceptable that people are held in jail indefinitely when they have a cognitive impairment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard again yesterday that Australia had breached its obligations, under various UN conventions, for four Aboriginal men with cognitive impairments in the Northern Territory. The response from this government has been to wash their hands of this issue, to disagree with the Australian Human Rights Commission's findings on the cases of these four Aboriginal men, and to say that it is not the government's responsibility. The government basically attacked the Australian Human Rights Commission for the findings that it made in relation to these four men. Australia has lost its way if we think it is acceptable that people who have not been found guilty of any crime but, in most cases, have been found unfit to plead or stand trial are then held indefinitely in maximum security prison. It is unacceptable: they have a cognitive impairment. On the day that we are celebrating International Day of People with Disability, we need to be committing to action to ensure that we address this appalling situation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  On 17 October I had the great privilege of attending the MS Go for Gold award ceremony for 2014 at the Town Centre Vikings Club, Tuggeranong. The Go for Gold scholarships are awarded to people living with multiple sclerosis who display a need and potential in various aspects of life. In attendance—along with my colleague Senator Kate Lundy—was the Director of Disability ACT, Richard Baumgart, key MS staff and directors, including the MS CEO Robyn Hunter, senior manager Susan Tame and ACT and southern New South Wales manager, Ann Lehmann. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Roslyn Emmerick, who was a recipient in 2013, conveyed the incredible positive influence the scholarship had in her life through a brilliant poem. Guests were then introduced to the 15 scholarship recipients, including: Jacqueline Beattie, Beverley Bray, Greg Browne, Yasmine Gray, Beverley Hergenhan, Suzanne Hutchings, Cesar Leon, Kerrie McDonald, Trevor Oddy, and Jen Severn. Each was awarded a scholarship to help realise their dreams. The objective of the Go for Gold scholarships program is to acknowledge the capacity of scholarship recipients to achieve their dreams, despite having multiple sclerosis. For all recipients, the scholarships provide the opportunity to significantly change their lives. The dreams of these individuals vary considerably from the desire to teach an art class, to taking their family holiday on a cruise, to one individual wanting to partake in skydiving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Central to the scholarship process is fundraising through the MS 24-hour Mega Swim initiative that saw scholarship candidates put together teams and raise funds to fight multiple sclerosis. The 24-hour Mega Swim has supported over 500 Go for Gold scholarship recipients across Australia in fulfilling a dream. Kerrie McDonald's team, The Has Beens, topped the fundraising with an impressive $34,270.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must congratulate Sherrit Lalande for coordinating the October event, Katie from Town Centre Vikings Club for hosting, Nick Byrne for his role as the MC, Mirimba Kovner for photography and Ann Lehmann for her role in presenting the awards. This was a thoroughly enjoyable event that was both celebratory and emotional for all involved, and I am honoured to have been part of this wonderful event and to see the MS Go for Gold recipients receiving their awards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As parents we always want the best for our children. We want them to grow up and experience the opportunities of this great country. An essential part of the development of children is education and, whilst it is important we teach our children the academic basics such as literacy and numeracy, it is also important that we equip our children early with education so they can make heathy choices and enjoy healthy lifestyles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Life Education is the largest independent Australian health and education provider for school-aged children from 5-13 years. It is during this time of growth that children need to instil healthy habits to carry them in good stead into their teenage years. On Monday, 10 November, I had the opportunity to join in on a Life Education lesson with year 2 students at Telopea Park School, which is just down the road from Parliament House. I was joined by Life Education CEO, Jay Bacik, and the ACT Life Action Group Chairman, Captain Christine Clarke. The Life Education Mobile Learning Centre was parked on the school grounds, where educator Michelle Bauman and of course the iconic mascot Healthy Harold treated the kids to an interactive and fun hour long lesson on how to lead a healthy lifestyle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been around for 35 years, Life Education and Healthy Harold have been teaching children all about the importance of leading healthy lifestyles—setting up those habits early on in life—and how to set a good example within their families. The lessons are made up of a mix of social-skills training, role-play sessions, the correction of common myths and interactive and fast moving activities using the latest multimedia technology. At the core of Life Education is a burning desire to see generations of healthy young Australians living their full potential. I am in complete agreement with their vison, which stresses the uniqueness and specialness of each and every child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is programs such as Life Education that enable effective and healthy parenting and foster positive development in our kids. Life Education visits over 600,000 children, works with over 24,000 teachers and engages 3400 schools on an annual basis. This is an incredible effort and a positive influence not just here in the ACT but right around Australia. It is with the help of Life Education and their creative lessons that we can teach children to respect their bodies, to be healthy and active and to make wise choices in life. I would like to thank Life Education for giving me the honour of being an ambassador for them in the ACT. I proudly display the plaque they have given me in my office. This organisation does children in the ACT and across Australia a world of good, and may it continue providing this guidance for many more years to come. I would also like to make mention of Kerrie Blain, the Principal of Telopea school for hosting us on the day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday morning I had the privilege of opening the Lifeline Canberra Christmas Book Fair at Calwell Shops. I was joined by many eager booklovers, who were very keen to get their hands on the thousands of fiction and non-fiction books, comics, DVDs and magazines that were on display. This book fair provided a wonderful opportunity for the Lifeline community to connect with the southern Canberra region, as most of Lifeline's fundraising events are held in the North Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 43 years Lifeline Canberra has been providing telephone crisis support to people in need, as well as a number of mental health awareness programs to the local community. From the Calwell Book Fair last Friday, the total amount raised came to $13,570. This was a great success and all of the proceeds were donated to Lifeline Canberra's suicide prevention program, which is a part of the Telephone Crisis Support service, and touches the lives of many Canberrans. I know of friends and loved ones who have accessed Lifeline during some of their most difficult times. I thank all of those who do such great work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  I am sticking to the topic, because I hope Senator Wong will get down to the Christmas lights display for SIDS and Kids. It is in the city, in Petrie Plaza, this year. Last year, and I think for a number of years previously, David and Janine Richards had hosted it at their house in Forrest. They had a world record number of lights. They are going for a new world record, in the city this time. It is the main lights display for the city. It is a fantastic event. The lights display in previous years has been absolutely spectacular. It was a world record for the number of lights but it was also a beautiful display.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lights display is raising money for SIDS and Kids, which as we know is such an important organisation that raises awareness and does research into sudden infant death syndrome. It is critical in supporting families who may be grieving. SIDS and Kids is fantastic. I will give it a plug but I will also give David and Janine Richards a plug for putting on what is an extraordinary thing. In the past, David and Janine Richards have done this almost on their own. There has been sponsorship by the likes of ActewAGL and others over time, but a lot of it has been driven personally by David and Janine. I know that whilst the ACT government has come on board this year, which is why it is the main lights display, David and Janine will still be driving at. I congratulate David and Janine Richards and SIDS and Kids, and encourage parliamentarians, other Canberrans and other people in the region to get down and see a world record lights display and enjoy the Christmas spirit. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I rise to speak in solidarity with the volunteers of Micah Challenge, an inspirational movement of young Christians from churches and groups all around Australia determined to ease the global scourge of poverty and injustice. In the lead-up to this year's G20, members of Micah Challenge had well over 100 meetings with parliamentarians to shine the light on the corruption, multinational tax dodging and profit-shifting that robs the world's poor of vital resources for sustainable development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Developing countries lose vast amounts of money each year due to tax dodging, bribery, corruption and illicit financial flows. Effective tax systems, based on cooperative relationships between governments, businesses and individuals, are a bedrock for democracy and growth. When businesses and citizens form part of the formal economy, good tax administration can lift millions out of poverty by enabling the provision of essential services like health care, pensions, education and other instruments of a modern state. If multinational companies and wealthy individuals avoid paying taxes, everyone else has to either pay more tax or go without these services. Multinational corporations can dodge tax quite easily even in Australia, a nation with relatively well policed tax laws, even though the government is slashing jobs at the tax office, and even more easily in developing countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor was in government we put in place a significant package aimed at closing some of those loopholes. And, while I am pleased to see that this government has pursued in principle the agenda on multinational profit shifting, its legislative actions are devaluing its words. While the government went to the G20 and said it was a priority to deal with multinational profit shifting, its only actions have been to reverse parts of Labor's package. We are now past a cumulative $1.1 billion in multinational profit shifting measures announced by Labor and reversed by the government, and Australia's losses to tax avoidance are comparatively light. Developing countries are estimated to lose to tax havens almost three times what they get from developed countries in aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the Australian government had a real opportunity as the president of the G20 to make a difference on this issue, to break down the walls of financial secrecy. As the president of the G20, the Australian government could have supported changes to the global tax rules that would ensure companies are taxed where they are actually doing business and not allow them to shift profits to secret jurisdictions through artificial legal structures that exploit loopholes in international tax laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government had followed the inspired and tireless lead of the young women and men from Micah Challenge, then it might have ensured its rhetoric about economic growth referred to more than merely job creation. Growth must include employment, of course, but the Prime Minister ignored the need for growth to also include those who do not have a job, the:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the provision of public goods to guarantee equality of opportunities, and counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies to reduce volatility—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">and progress against corruption. That is why growth must include inclusive growth, as so many of the G20 leaders urged to be included in the communique.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of the G20 commitments on corruption and tax avoidance risk appearing token, as most if not all G20 countries are already subject to international Financial Action Task Force commitments to require key tax information to be kept and shared, yet most have not been implementing them. But if this progress is made, if these commitments are implemented, if developing countries can keep one-quarter of their GDP in tax revenue through global tax systems reform, instead of one-tenth, then they will not necessarily be asking for aid from Australia, they will be asking to trade with Australia. They will be lifted out of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the advocacy of Micah Challenge and all its individuals and groups, as well as NGOs, unions, community groups and parliamentarians who continue to shine a light on corruption, on multinational tax dodging and on profit shifting that robs the world's poor of vital resources and sustainable development. Let's hope that this tax evasion ends to benefit the world's poor.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Conroy would need to understand that this is a very serious program that requires the government to actually roll up its sleeves and start to do something. They did six years of nothing, whilst telling the Australian public that everything is rosy in the garden, they had options and they were going forward for the program. But what we got there as a new government we found that nothing has been done with what is one of Australia's most important strategic deterrent capabilities. This is a disgrace. It is a disgrace which you seem to want to dress up as some sort of something that we are doing that is wrong. We are doing everything right to try and clean up your mess and get this particular program, which is such an important program and a vital strategic asset, back on track given the mess you left us.</span>

We have scrapped the world's biggest carbon tax, saving the average Australian household $550 each and every year, whilst protecting tens of thousands of jobs in the manufacturing sector. We have also abolished Labor's job destroying mining tax, unshackling this vital sector to create more jobs for more Australians.

We have cut $2 billion in red tape alone, freeing Australian businesses from the burden of unnecessary and obsolete regulation, helping them to employ more people. We have stopped the boats, preventing deaths at sea and saving the budget billions of dollars. In 2013 under Labor, there were 302 illegal boat arrivals; under this government, that number has been reduced to just one. We have provided an additional $630 million to our police and security services to strengthen our national security.

Pay is always an important issue, particularly for men and women in uniform. I was not at that meeting. I have not received any information in support of your contention. I am therefore very reluctant to comment on it. Defence Force pay issues are always at the front of this government's mind. The relationship we have with our uniformed personnel is very good and strong. Indeed, I think the relationship that we have with uniforms as a government stands in complete and stark contrast to the derision that the former government was held in by uniformed personnel, which took so much money out of the defence budget, having had to deal with a chronic shortage of resources in managing a Defence Force capability plan. While the Labor Party was in power, the current Chief of Army said that further funding cuts to defence would risk soldiers' lives. That is what you have bequeathed to us. That is what we are repairing. Dealing, as we have, with tough measures on pay, we are seeking to provide the necessary resources so that our men and women in the field can have the full benefit of a properly resourced Defence Force.</span>

I think that would be a very good place to start—the people who actually run universities and colleges in this country, the people who run TAFEs and who run institutes which would allow tens of thousands more students to receive a higher education which they are currently not able to do with Commonwealth support. That is the sort of conversation you should be having. You are exactly right.</span>

This is about changing the Australian higher education system so that it is amongst the most competitive in the world so that our students can be in the most competitive higher education institutions in the world. The choice that we are faced with is the approach that was taken by those opposite—and you know this is the case, Senator Rhiannon—in which the years up to 2016-17 would have seen $6.6 billion worth of cuts out of the higher education sector. You know that is the case. What we are trying to do is maximise the opportunities for students, provide pathways for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, provide scholarship opportunities, enable students who are studying for diplomas and advanced diplomas to actually receive Commonwealth support for doing that for the first time ever. Every single peak body in higher education in this country supports these reforms.</span>

Earlier this year, as senators would be aware, the coalition government made a commitment that in 2014-15 we would provide a minimum of 4,400 resettlement places under the Special Humanitarian Program for people affected by the humanitarian crises in Iraq and Syria. This includes a minimum of 2,200 places for Iraqis, including ethnic and religious minorities fleeing the violence in northern Iraq to neighbouring countries. It also includes a minimum of 2,200 places for Syrians, including those living in desperate conditions in Lebanon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to resettling Syrians and Iraqis escaping the conflict zone highlights without a doubt the humanitarian dividends that are made possible as a result of this government's successful border protection policies. The only dissenting voices to the coalition government's overwhelmingly successful border protection policies are the people smugglers, whose business model we have smashed, and those opposite, still vocally supported by the Greens, who continue to show that they just do not get it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has made it very clear that priority in the humanitarian program should be for those waiting overseas and entering Australia under an orderly process. The brutality of ISIS has been made abundantly clear to all and in the immigration portfolio we are doing everything that we can within an orderly process to ensure that we can assist those who are in these conflict situations.</span>

Just yesterday we witnessed an extraordinary outburst from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Ms Plibersek, in which she demonstrated that the Labor Party still just do not understand why it is important for the government of the day to have control over its border policies. She was on Sky News with David Speers. Speersy said on Syria that the government has announced some 4,000 positions for refugees from Syria and Iraq that arguably would not have existed under Labor's policy, when all of those places went to those who came by boat. Ms Plibersek responded:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Ms Plibersek clearly failed to understand is that those people were coming illegally by boat and they were not coming from source countries. This again shows that those opposite believe that any arrival in Australia is a good arrival and is acceptable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

These are the people who market the voyage to Australia with the promise of permanent residency at the end of it. These are the people who are more than willing to put women, men and children on leaky boats, risking their lives again on the false promise of permanent residency in Australia. On this side of the chamber we understand, as do the overwhelming majority of Australians who voted for our policies at the last election, that a government needs to retain control over its resettlement program and, as long as this government is in office, that is exactly what we will do.</span>

In relation to the renewable energy target, the government recently announced that it would not be changing the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme for households, but the government has been deliberately vague over the overall position on the SRES. As the government knows, the SRES has two components: the household component, which is those installations less than 10 kilowatts, and the small business component, which is those installations up to 100 kilowatts in size. Is the government trying to cut out the small business component of the SRES just as this important market is starting to thrive?</span>

What the government is trying to do in reforming the renewable energy target is ensure that it operates as it was originally designed to do. Originally the objective was to establish a renewable energy target that would see 20 per cent of our energy come from renewable energy sources. Of course, given the falls in energy demand across the Australian economy, effectively now we are heading for a renewable energy target of 26 per cent. That is hurting the Australian economy, hurting business and hurting families because it is pushing up the cost of electricity beyond what it should be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want Australia to be, as the Prime Minister has said in the past, the affordable energy capital of the world. We want to ensure that the renewable energy target effectively goes back to a real 20 per cent target. We do want to quarantine the small-scale renewable energy target. We want to ensure that we provide an exemption from the renewable energy target for emissions-intensive trade-exposed businesses and by doing so get ourselves back into a position where we are pursuing a real 20 per cent renewable energy target. That will help bring down the cost of electricity. That will help bring down the cost of doing business in Australia. That will help make us more competitive internationally. That will help us strengthen the economy. It will help create jobs. Of course, that is what we are all about. We are about reform that will help us build a stronger and more prosperous economy and create jobs where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead. I say to Senator Lazarus that it is a matter of getting the balance right: it is about providing support for the renewable energy target but in a way that is actually sustainable and responsible. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Small businesses can use this scheme to reduce one of their largest costs—their electricity. We know large electricity companies want to reduce the renewable energy target at the cost of the small business community. PUP will not allow the SRES to be shrunk from where it is now. Small businesses need the right to access the scheme. Why won't the government join PUP and other crossbenchers to give the small business sector the certainty it needs?</span>

It is very important that as we reform the policy settings for the renewable energy target that we provide certainty to the market—of course. But we need to do it in a way that actually does not expose the Australian economy to a disadvantage when we are competing for business in the world. Right now cost pressures that are faced by Australian businesses as a result of the way the renewable energy target is currently operating makes Australian businesses that are competing in a global environment less competitive than those businesses that we are competing with overseas. We want Australian businesses to be more competitive, in particular, because we are actually overwhelmingly environmentally more efficient. Our aluminium sector here in Australia is environmentally more efficient— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

So what I would say to Senator Lazarus and to any senator in this chamber is that our door is open. We are committed to keep talking to the Labor Party, to the Palmer United Party, to the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, to Senator Lambie, to the Family First Party, to the Liberal Democrats—we are even prepared to talk with the Greens, even though the Greens are not a very environmentally focused party these days. We are prepared to talk to anyone who is actually prepared to work with this on finding common ground. But the guiding principle has to be: to achieve an environmentally beneficial outcome in a way that is economically responsible. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There is also a wheelchair basketball in Western Australia and much more.</span>

As you would know, Mr President, this seeks to put the power in the hands of the individual. An individual is assessed for the needs that they have, they are given an entitlement commensurate to their needs, and then they can take that to the service provider of their choice. I would note that, obviously, if as a person with a significant disabilities you are getting the daily supports that you need, you will be in a much better position to contemplate entering the workforce. I think that is one of the great benefits of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Again, as I often do, I want to acknowledge the staff of the National Disability Insurance Agency and the Department of Social Services for the incredible effort that they are putting into make the NDIS a reality.</span>

The NDIS was fully provided for in the last budget. Over the forward estimates there was a full accounting and provision for the NDIS. I think it is worth, at a time of particularly robust exchanges in this place and what is probably a little bit of a fraught week, to reflect that the parliament does come together and does function on occasion. The NDIS is a manifestation of that, and I think that is something that the parliament can be well pleased with.</span>

The National Disability Strategy is also very important. That provides that all levels of government have a responsibility to make sure that people with disability have the access and opportunities they deserve.</span>

Informed Defence opinion tells us that Australia needs a minimum of six conventional diesel-electric submarines and six nuclear submarines to replace the current Collins class submarine fleet. The minister has previously said that our future submarine fleet has to be regionally dominant and superior. Given the superior range, speed and capability of nuclear submarines, and that a number of our G20 colleagues have full nuclear submarine capabilities, will the government commission a feasibility study into including nuclear submarines in our future submarine fleet?</span>

The Future Submarine program is, as I am sure the senator knows, the most significant investment in defence capability that is coming over the horizon for Australia. It is extremely important that we get this right, particularly when we are starting from scratch. The government is committed to delivering the most capable replacement submarines for Collins at the best price and with the least risk to our nation's future security. We owe it to our nation not to expose it to critical capability gaps that we now face because the previous government did nothing for six years on submarines, as I have said on so many occasions. We also of course owe it to taxpayers to provide value for money. A nuclear option is not currently coalition policy due to the significant costs and other strategic and logistical challenges we would face, given that Australia does not have, as we all know, a domestic nuclear energy generation industry. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia currently lacks the infrastructure, training facilities, regulatory and safety systems necessary to operate and maintain nuclear powered submarines. These would add considerably to the cost of our Future Submarine program and would take a substantial period of time to develop in order to be part of that program. Australia also currently lacks suitably qualified and experienced personnel within our Royal Australian Navy and across industry to safely operate and sustain nuclear powered submarines. I congratulate you on commencing the debate, if that is what we are doing. It is an important debate but it is a very expensive one.</span>

I have had the benefit of a half-day tour of an Astute class submarine at Barrow-in-Furness in the United Kingdom. This is a phenomenal piece of strategic capability, but it is extremely expensive—several billion euro, several billion pounds. Literally two generations of nuclear experience have gone into its development. We have none of that capacity. The debate should focus on whether we commence attaining that capacity, whether we should look at whether nuclear energy would provide to us advantages over current energy generation systems in the very long term. With respect to South Australia, we are trying to bring forward a program cost-effectively and we are fighting schedule every day. To introduce this would simply delay the program. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The consideration of whether we would stovepipe and compartmentalise submarine output and submarine strategic capability has been considered within Defence, to the best of my knowledge, for some time. Given current interoperation between surface and air assets, it is seen that the cohesion between the various dimensions of platforms—subsurface, surface and air—requires that we not go down the path of creating a separate compartment for our submarine capability. What we need is a cohesive operational force element group in the nature of submarines that works with our ships and our planes and cohesively provides management of the battle space as the one cohesive unit. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have to tell you that what they bequeathed to us is clearly understandable given the intellectual rigor brought to this question time by the senator.</span>

I am pleased to inform the Senate that the government has announced an expert review of medicines and medical devices. Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom AO will chair the expert review panel. Professor Samson has extensive experience in the pharmaceutical sector. He played a major role in the development of Australia's National Medicines Policy and is a former longstanding chair of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. He will be joined on the panel by Mr Will Delaat AM and Professor John Horvath AO. The review will examine Australia's regulatory framework for therapeutic goods which is administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in order to identify opportunities to modernise regulations, to ensure Australians can access the latest treatments in a timely manner and areas of outdated or irrelevant regulation which have built up over time and need to be streamlined.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medical technology is constantly evolving and Australia needs a modern regulatory framework to ensure consumers can access new technologies without unnecessary delays. This review will in in way jeopardise the safety and quality of medicines and medical devices marketed in Australia. Consumer protections are paramount.</span>

The panel will provide recommendations for prescription and over-the-counter medicines as well as medical devices by 31 March 2015, and opportunities in the complementary medicines sector will be reported during the second quarter of 2015. </span>

Under the former government, almost 21,000 new regulations became part of our national life. Best practice regulation is necessary but it is fair to say that our therapeutic goods regulations are overdue for an upgrade. The terms of reference indicate the panel will consider changes to outdated or irrelevant regulations that have built up over time. If accepted by government, these recommendations will contribute to the annual red-tape reduction target. </span>

The coalition recently introduced new regulations to allow Australian manufacturers to obtain market approval for most medical devices, using conformity assessment certification from European notified bodies. With these changes, Australian manufacturers can choose to have conformity assessment conducted by either the TGA or a trusted European body. This will cut red tape and provide more flexibility for local manufacturers.</span>

The social and economic benefits of this change are immense.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The national accounts released today show the importance of our economic reform agenda. They show the importance of our policies to build a stronger, more prosperous economy where everyone can get ahead. Imagine what the national accounts would have shown today if we had not repealed the carbon tax, if we had not repealed the mining tax, if we had not made more than $1 trillion worth of project approvals, if we had not pursued three free trade agreements, and if we had not cut more than $1 billion in excessive business red tape costs out of the economy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national accounts released today showed that, over the past quarter, the economy grew by 0.3 per cent. That takes economic growth over the last 12 months, the first year of the Abbott government, to 2.7 per cent, compared to 1.9 per cent over the equivalent period of the previous government. That is of course stronger growth than what we experienced under Labor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are not resting on our laurels at all. Over the last 12 months we have set the foundations for stronger growth into the future. We have put in place the foundations for stronger economic growth, stronger prosperity and higher living standards into the future. What we inherited in September last year was a weakening economy, rising unemployment, low consumer confidence and lower business investment. Over the last 12 months we have been ensuring that, moving forward on the back of stronger economic growth, we can create more jobs, improve living standards and set the foundations for budget repair. </span>

Labor keeps hiding behind the global financial crisis to justify its failure in government, to justify the debt and deficit disaster they left behind.

They will not stand up for the Australian defence industry, they will not stand up for the families in South Australia, they will not stand up for the skills and they will not stand up for the capacity of the industry in South Australia.

This debate is squarely aimed at trying to vilify a person who is scrambling to fill a void which you left. Senator Cameron comes in here and talks about the activities of this government when he, while sitting around on the fringes of the Labor reign of power, did nothing. Let us look at the record of those opposite. The then leader, Kevin Rudd said we will build these submarines at the ASC in about 2017. Now that is not far from here. So what did those opposite do? Did they sign a contract? Did they go out and look for procurement? No. In the 2010 campaign they told us, 'We promise to build the submarines at ASC in Adelaide.' What did they do? Did they go out and ask for contracts? No, they did nothing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what those opposite did in the lead-up to the 2013 election? Mr Shorten, in the lead-up to the 2013 election, did not promise anything. Those opposite did not even have a defence policy. They got sick of promising it. They did not mention the 'submarine' word. They just ran out of puff. Actually, they ran out of money. Do you know what was going on? At the heart of the issue was the competence of that government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite seem quite shrill over there. I see Senator Cameron has left the chamber. He needs to be reminded of why those opposite did not commit to submarine builds—they ran out of other people's money. They ran out of taxpayers' money. That is why they did not build them. There was $19.6 billion pulled out of that budget and those opposite sit there after 12 months of us being in power saying 'if you are going to build them, build them here'. How extraordinary.

                  </a>  Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, you had better check with the attendants: I am not sure but I think there might be a seagull in the chamber somewhere. The $16 billion is what happened—the lowest levels of spending on defence since 1938. It was incompetence writ large. In 2012-13, Labor made the largest single cut to the defence budget since the end of the Korean conflict. Labor cut 10.5 per cent more from the budget. On Labor's watch, the Australian defence industry shed more than 10 per cent of its workforce because of budget cuts and deferrals.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How was the record of those opposite on open tenders? Out of 77-odd, I think there were about 70 that never got put out for open tender. As those opposite know over there, I am an advocate for an open tender on this program. Do you know why? Because it is the single biggest defence infrastructure project in this nation's history. And who is doing it? We are. What did those opposite do? Zero, nothing. And how shrill they sound. They ran out of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite do not even know how to manage money because they never have. All they have ever had to do is give their union dues and look after their numbers at their next preselection, and that is the only counting they have ever done. They have never had a bank manager. There are a couple of you over there on the other side, I must give you your due, that have run a business. But the only counting those opposite have ever done is vote to get elected to this place. That is what happens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting about and doing what we have to do to bring this project back into order to address the essential security of this country. It is so important to our front-line defence. What did those opposite do with it? Nothing. We are doing something about it and we are doing it now.</span>

I note that he is saying a very different thing in this chamber than what he said when he was out there talking to the South Australia media.</span>

His former long-serving staff say that it is time for him to go. The party backbench says it is time for him to go. And today we learned that the assistant minister says that David Johnston is already gone. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fin</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ancial</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Review</span> scuttlebutts have duly reported a tip-off today that Assistant Minister for Defence, Stuart Robert, described Johnston as 'a goner' within earshot of everyone in business class on a Virgin flight out of Canberra last week. He did not even feel the need to bother to whisper it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also speaking up for everyone to hear is Johnston's former staffer, Russell Stranger. After more than a dozen years of service as a senior adviser, Mr Stranger has unloaded on his former boss, who he now describes as 'toothless' and 'incidental'. Mr Stranger has spent 12 years propping up the senator from WA, but the Australian people have taken less than 12 months to figure out that this minister is a dud. Certainly, the Prime Minister knows his minister needs to go. In Russell Stranger's words:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Johnston is a sheep in sheep's clothing. By his own admission, he has nothing to add. When asked by the press why he skipped a National Security Committee meeting in October he replied:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the defence minister's word is not always reliable. No, we must never take him at his word. We cannot take this government, that will go down in history for its falsehoods and as led by a Prime Minister who has repeatedly told mistruths to Australia, at its word. Senator Johnston was also less than truthful when he promised to build submarines in Adelaide.</span>

In this place almost exactly one week ago, his slur against the men and women of the ASC left his own party members dazed and confused. He knows the Liberal Party senators from South Australia, be they Senator Birmingham, Senator Edwards, Senator Fawcett or Senator Ruston, have spoken out against the proposals that he has been floating.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Johnston's own pay deal for our defence forces on the eve of Christmas holidays has shown us just how poorly he values the work of our uniformed personnel. Today, he tried to claim again during question time that he has a great relationship with our defence forces. But, Mr Deputy President, can you imagine how embarrassed they must be by his bumbling, mumbling and stumbling? Prime Minister Tony Abbott will not even stand beside Senator Johnston. Last week, the Prime Minister was spotted in his courtyard on Monday, rubbing his hands and begging for forgiveness, with his own defence minister nowhere to be seen. We say: enough! Bring this sad mess to a sad end. What on earth is Senator Johnston waiting for? Christmas? The New Year? Another crisis? It is simply time for him to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The soldiers, the sailors, the airmen and the civilians who toil to keep us safe every day—these men and women deserve better. I say to the Prime Minister: it is time to take action on Senator Johnston. Listen to your own backbenchers who think it is time for him to go. Listen to the uniformed members of the ADF who think it is time for him to go. Listen to Senator Johnston's former staff who clearly think it is time for him to go. The assistant minister said it loud enough for everyone in business class to hear last week, that he is a goner. Nobody deserves Senator Johnston, not even Tony Abbott.</span>

                  </a>  Like many things, they made announcements. But, of course, actions speak louder than words, and they never did a thing as far as improving our Defence Force to keep our nation safe and secure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hysteria of the Labor Party on this issue must end. They must put national security ahead of supporting their union mates. The government's approach to acquire the submarines follows exactly the same process as that in place for all major defence projects since the 2003 Kinnaird reforms to defence procurement. This process has been used by previous governments, and was the same process that was going to be used by Labor if they ever got around to making any decisions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will follow due process. There will be a thorough, two-pass cabinet process and we will receive advice from our defence chiefs and procurement experts to ensure we get the very best capability at the best value for taxpayer dollars.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is amazing that under Labor, $16 billion was cut from defence—$16 billion: a fact. The share of GDP spent on defence had fallen to 1.56 per cent, its lowest level since 1938. That is absolutely disgusting! How could the previous Labor government treat our Defence Force with such disdain; to cut, cut and cut and now leave us in the situation of the lowest percentage of GDP since 1938? This was just prior to World War II, of course! That is what our predecessors did to our Defence Force.</span>

                  </a>  That is exactly right—I will take your interjection, Senator Edwards. We are out there to fix their mess. That is a thing that we have to do all the time: fix their mess—especially the financial mess they left us in, as they have done for all of my life. Ever since I left school at the end of 1972, whenever there is a Labor government and then they are thrown out of government, how are the books? The books are terrible! How is the bank account? The bank account is empty! How is the overdraft? The overdraft is bigger!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the history right throughout of Labor governments' management of money, whether it be at a state level—from Victoria to South Australia to New South Wales to Western Australia to Tasmania—or a federal level. The Hawke-Keating government left $96 billion of debt at the end of their era in 1996. Who cleaned up the mess? The coalition government of course, under John Howard as Prime Minister and Peter Costello as Treasurer. The challenge we have now is to clean up your financial mess—almost $350 billion of debt as of last Friday—and here we are trying to put our budget back together so that we have money to spend on very important issues like defence, but you will not help us to get our budget in order.</span>

How ironic is that? How hypocritical is that? You are here to obstruct. I will tell you now: if the budget is not brought into order it will lead to one thing down the road; in five, 10 or 15 years' times it will lead to higher taxes.

                  </a>  When we hit the brick wall of debt, Senator Carr, because of the actions of people like you—you are content to mortgage our grandchildren's futures away without any concerns about their financial situation—we will look back and we will look on you as the money wreckers who blocked our savings to get the budget in order. That is the most important thing, getting the budget in order so that we can afford to have a proper, secure Defence Force with modern equipment. But, no, you over there are just out to wreck the budget. It is in your DNA. It is as simple as that. A Labor government means budget mess. As I said, it has happened all my life. And here is a case of you crying poor, crying crocodile tears for the Defence Force, when history proves you made an absolute mess of our Australian Defence Force. You should be ashamed of yourselves. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  It is hard to know where to start. Let me begin by refuting this rubbish from across the chamber about the budget crisis. Everything they have done, every bad decision they have made has been constructed around this falsehood that there is some kind of budget crisis. There is not. We have debt that we can manage, and we have debt that we can manage because we created a stimulus package to make sure jobs were not lost during the global financial crisis. What the Liberal Party and the coalition government cannot cope with is that we were enormously successful in achieving our goals and now we find ourselves in here being lectured to by people peddling misinformation about the state of the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the back of that, they have constructed a budget which cuts the heart out of so many things that Australians value, so many things that Australians understand form part of what it is to live in a society that is both civil and fair. One of the things that is civil and fair about Australian society is that we value the work of our public servants in general terms, and yet what they are getting from this government is a blanket cut to a basic wage increase that covers their cost-of-living expenses—the CPI. What we know from this government, and I would like to refer to a statement put out by my colleagues, is that the Prime Minister stated in parliament last week:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that tells me is this government are prepared to do a despicable thing, such as withholding budgeted wage increases for our ADF, so that they can justify holding back, unfairly, Commonwealth public servants' wage increases. There is a pattern of behaviour here, and it is appalling. I know, as its representative, that the ACT probably has the highest ratio of both Defence Force personnel and Commonwealth public servants. And I know that these people were both outraged and shattered, if they were in fact Liberal Party supporters, because they did not expect such appalling treatment from the party that they voted for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Defence Force wage increase, we heard today that Minister Johnston is going to pursue the activities in relation to his junior minister, who was apparently incredibly dismissive and rude to the petitioners who went to him to express their outrage regarding the Defence Force wage cut. I am pleased to hear the minister is going to pursue this—or at least he said he would—and provide some kind of retribution for the petitioners who basically came out of that meeting and said about the government, and I quoted this during question time, that it was 'arrogant, ill-informed and self-centred'. This is not language used very often by petitioners trying to lobby a government or advocate for a certain point of view. It is an extremely harsh criticism, but I think it is a fair criticism, of a government that has lost its way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we have seen a long list of things that the defence minister and the Abbott government need to address. The Defence Force pay issue is a critical one. I do not believe that concessions delivered in relation to the Christmas allowances go far enough in any way to resolve the complaint of the Defence Force. Everybody needs to have a living wage. As I have said in this place previously, to attack our Defence Force personnel in the way that they have with this unfair wage cut, despite a previously budgeted full wage increase, is one of the most disappointing and disturbing features of this government's decision-making to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to draw people's attention to the fact that there is an obvious link, which has now been put into the public domain by the government, with the Commonwealth Public Service wage claims. I know the CPSU is locked into processes and disputes to pursue its members' interests, and I wish it all the best with that. We have suffered long and hard under a coalition government here in the ACT. I have strong memories— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                </a>  I would like to express regret about the confusion that arose in the chamber this morning when I sought leave to bring on debate on my Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. I had received the call from the President, but when it became clear to me that senators wished to rise in their places to show their respect to Mr Phillip Hughes I immediately resumed my seat. I sincerely apologise if any misunderstanding over Senate procedure caused distress to Mr Hughes's family. I understand this is a very difficult time for them and a sad day. I want them to know that the speeches given in the Senate for Phillip were magnificent and inspirational, in particular Senator John Faulkner, who spoke of Phillip's life and cricket career with such eloquence, passion and compassion. It was a privilege to hear Phillip's life and achievements discussed in such a beautiful and heartfelt way. My sincere sympathy and condolences go to the Hughes's family and friends.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Defence Legislation Amendment (Military Justice Enhancements—Inspector-General ADF) Bill 2014 (the Bill) amends the Defence Act 1903 to provide transparency, predictability and accountability in decision making affecting Australian Defence Force members. It will do this by enhancing the independence of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force and enabling regulatory reform of the Australian Defence Force's redress of grievance, investigation and inquiry practices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following detailed review of Defence's system of inquiry, investigation, review and audit, the Australian Defence Force concluded its current arrangements for these processes are unnecessarily complex, inefficient and legalistic. I am conscious of the need to support commanders to make good decisions, not to impede or discourage them from doing so. The complexity and inflexibility of current arrangements do not provide that support. I am also conscious of the need for robust, professional, credible, and independent oversight of the military justice system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I am conscious of the need to ensure that complex and sensitive matters concerning the Defence Force, such as those events that come to my and the Chief of Defence Force's attention, including the death of ADF members related to, or arising from their Service, can be subject to efficient and specialised internal inquiry and review. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such inquiries currently enjoy provisions overriding the privilege against self-incrimination so that underlying causes can be ascertained—such as in the Sea King Board of Inquiry—and addressed to prevent recurrences. However, the abrogation of this privilege should not be capable of being abused to obtain evidence for the imposition of criminal sanctions against persons. Therefore the Bill will prevent witness evidence obtained by the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination being used against that witness in service tribunals or civilian courts. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Improve the efficiency of investigating Service-related deaths. Under current arrangements, Service-related deaths must be investigated through a Chief of the Defence Force Commission of Inquiry, unless I direct otherwise. While on one hand this approach provides government and the public with the appearance of an independent inquiry into deaths, it is inefficient and is costly. It is my intention that, following the passage of the Bill, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 1985</span> will be amended so that there is no automatic requirement for a statutory inquiry for all service-related deaths. Instead, service-related deaths will be referred to the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force for review/inquiry. The Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force will determine in each case the process for review, or inquiry, into each death and may decide to conduct a public hearing, an inquiry in private, or a desk-top review only. Utilising the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force in this role will provide assurance that the Australian Defence Force is responding appropriately to service-related deaths and should significantly reduce the costs associated with such inquiries, while retaining credible and independent oversight of these sensitive matters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to rise and speak to this important bill, which I have introduced with the aim of preserving and enhancing the crucial role of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In a world characterised by unrest and fragile peace, the Australian Greens understand the need to have a robust conversation about our national security laws. We also have the highest regard for human rights and freedoms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When it comes to national security, we often hear arguments that traverse the 'if you only knew what I know' territory. That is, those with unfettered access to national security information justify sweeping changes to legislation on the basis of information not publicly available. Of course, it is necessary that sensitive information be kept confidential. But the position of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, which I will refer to as 'the Monitor', is unique because it is held by a person who has a full understanding of the threat faced and of the measures to be taken to address this threat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />As the United Kingdom's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation has said, the concept of an independent reviewer of national security legislation is, in many ways, ground breaking:<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">A person is selected on the basis of independence from Government; given unrestricted access to classified documents and national security personnel; and his conclusions—favourable or otherwise—promptly published not just to Ministers but to Parliament and the general public.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">" </span>The Reviewer goes on to state: "<span style="font-style:italic;">By accepting review of this kind, Ministers make it harder for themselves to use the age-old brush-off: </span>'If you had seen what I have seen …'<span style="font-style:italic;"> The Independent Reviewer </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">has </span><span style="font-style:italic;">seen what they have seen and, unconstrained by the disciplines or loyalties of office, has every reason—unless he has gone rogue or gone native—to tell it as it is.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The role of Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is one of vital importance which should be strengthened and properly resourced. Perhaps most critically—the position of Monitor must be filled—not left to languish on the statute books while the government makes wide ranging and deeply significant changes to Australia's counter-terrorism and national security laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the specifics of this bill, schedule 1 comprises amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 </span>(the Act)<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to ensure that the Monitor can review <span style="font-style:italic;">proposed </span>as well as existing national security legislation and to do the following:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">to make it clear in the objects clause of the act that the Monitor is required to consider whether Australia's national security legislation is a <span style="font-style:italic;">proportionate</span> response to the national security threat faced; </span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">ensure that the position of Monitor is a full time position, cannot be left vacant and is supported by appropriate staff; and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">ensure that all reports of the Monitor are tabled in parliament and that the government is required to respond to the recommendations of the Monitor within six months of tabling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms would bring the legal framework establishing the Monitor closer to that applying to other statutory oversight bodies such as the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 of the bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986</span> to ensure that it is a function of the Australian Human Rights Commission to refer matters to the Monitor for inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is particularly critical at this time of prolific expansion of Australia's national security legislation, and in light of the adoption of time frames that severely limit parliamentary and other forms of independent scrutiny of proposed reforms. In this year alone, the government has introduced three significant pieces of legislation which have implications for national security: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">All The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The office of the Monitor was established in 2010 to help ensure that Australia's national security legislation is, in fact, effective in deterring and preventing terrorism and terrorism-related activity which threatens Australia's security, as well as being consistent with Australia's international obligations under international law and contains appropriate safeguards for protecting the rights of individuals. Mr Bret Walker SC held the position of Monitor from 21 April 2011 to 20 April 2014. Since then, no Monitor has been appointed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is deeply regrettable that this office should remain vacant at a time of the most significant legislative reform in this area for almost a decade. It is also deeply regrettable that despite the preparation and tabling of four detailed and comprehensive reports by the former Monitor, Mr Bret Walker SC, there has been no official government response (from either the Labor Party or the Coalition) other than the legislation described above, which selectively, and often erroneously, claims to implement some of the Monitor's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Earlier this year, the government tried to repeal the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010</span>, claiming the role of Monitor was unnecessary, and must be removed as part of its 'reduction of red tape' budgetary measures. This lack of respect for the role of Monitor, which is blatantly apparent from the current lack of appointment to the position, comes at a time when the community needs an active, well resourced, well respected independent Monitor more than ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Despite the government's clear ambivalence about the position, the importance of the role of the Monitor was reflected in the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in its report on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation (Foreign Fighters) Amendment Bill 2014. Indeed, following on the back of those recommendations, the role of the Monitor has recently been significantly expanded by that legislation, the 'Foreign Fighters Bill'. The bill amended the act by introducing a new subsection 6(1A) that requires the Monitor to review the sun-setting counter-terrorism provisions in the ASIO Act, the Criminal Code and the Crimes Act (such as the control order and preventative detention order regimes, ASIO's questioning and detention powers and the new 'designated area' offences) by 7 September 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Private Senator's Bill, which I am introducing in my role as legal affairs spokesperson for the Australian Greens, recognises the critical role the Monitor has played, and must continue to play, in reviewing Australia's national security legislation and providing the public and the parliament with independent advice as to whether these laws are necessary, effective, and proportionate – and to consider their impact on individual rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill seeks to amend the act so that the current situation, where the role of Monitor is left vacant and recommendations can be ignored, cannot be allowed to continue in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Critically, this bill will ensure that the Monitor is empowered to provide independent, expert advice about the effectiveness and proportionately of <span style="font-style:italic;">proposed</span> changes to Australia's counter-terrorism and national security laws<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>as well as existing legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill also enhances the independent character of the Monitor by ensuring that he or she can receive references from the Senate Committees on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and from the Australian Human Rights Commission. By preserving and enhancing the role of the Monitor, the bill aims to give the Australian community confidence that Australia's counter-terrorism and national security laws are operating effectively and accountably, and in a manner consistent with Australia's international obligations, including human rights obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The function of the Monitor is to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the counter-terrorism and national security legislation and report his or her comments, findings and recommendations to the Prime Minster, and in turn parliament, on an annual basis. The Monitor must also consider whether Australia's counter-terrorism and national security legislation contains appropriate safeguards for protecting individuals' rights, remains proportionate to any threat of terrorism or threat to national security, or both, and remains necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recent moves by this government to rush through drastic and draconian changes to national security laws which weaken the rights and freedoms that sustain our democracy are further evidence that this bill is necessary and that the role of the Monitor must be strengthened as we cannot rely on either current or future governments to give the position of INSLM the respect it deserves. A stronger Monitor is fundamental to provide transparency and accountability for national security laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens understand the need to give our law enforcement and security agencies the tools they need to protect Australians. However, we also believe that security laws must be proportionate and balance the need for security with the imperative for human rights and freedoms. This Private Senator's Bill responds to the critical need—already keenly felt within the parliament and the community—for careful, independent scrutiny of Australia's counter-terrorism and national security laws. When making serious and highly complex changes to our national security laws, it is so important we seek expert, independent advice to assist us in making good decisions that are in the best interest of all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes proposed by this bill also align with world's best practice in countering terrorism in a manner consistent with human rights. As the former UN Special Rapporteur for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, has explained, best practice demands regular and independent review of counter-terrorism laws and their impact on human rights, and that review mechanisms be based on statutory terms of appointment, linked to the work of relevant parliamentary committees and accompanied by adequate resourcing. Review mechanisms should enable public consultation and should be accompanied by publicly available reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The past reports of the Monitor on existing counter-terrorism laws demonstrate the capacity of the person in this role to identify what aspects of the laws are having a disproportionate effect on human rights, and to identify practical alternative mechanisms to deter, prevent and disrupt terrorist activity in Australia. For example, in his Second Annual Report, the Monitor examined the existing control order regime, noting that because control orders <span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">do not require the established safeguards of a criminal trial according to law and because they may be very restrictive in their effect on a person</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s way of life – personally, socially and occupationally – it is critical that these provisions be scrutinized.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>The Monitor concluded that: <span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">control orders in their present form are not effective, not appropriate and not necessary.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Monitor considered the effectiveness of the control orders regime at preventing terrorist activity in Australia as well as the impact of the regime on human rights. The Monitor concluded that the existing regime required substantive reform, suggesting that <span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">they may be effective, would be appropriate and might be regarded as necessary in the case of persons already convicted of terrorist offences whose dangerousness at the expiry of their sentences of imprisonment can be shown.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span> These recommendations have been ignored by the Government, which has since introduced legislation that would significantly expand the scope of the control order regime and dilute existing procedural safeguards. This legislation was rushed through Parliament without the opportunity for expert, independent advice to be sought or considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One significant restriction on the power of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to perform its functions is the source of its referrals. Currently, only the Prime Minister and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security can refer matters to the Monitor for review and report. This effectively excludes any extra-parliamentary body at all, or any parliamentary body that is not subject to government vetting, from referring matters to the Monitor. This severely limits the independent character of the Monitor, and can leave the Parliament without access to independent, expert advice on proposed and existing counter-terrorism and national security laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments encompassed by this bill will ensure that the two committees on legal and constitutional affairs—who are regularly involved in scrutinising proposed and existing counter-terrorism laws—are empowered to refer relevant matters to the Monitor for review and reform—as well as empowering Australia's pre-eminent human rights body—the Australian Human Rights Commission to make such a referral.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committees (Legislation and References) are made up of a more representative cross section of the Parliament which will enable crossbenchers to engage more fully on issues of national security, given they are currently excluded from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Human Rights Commission is uniquely placed to identify whether and to what extent national security laws are engaging with or infringing upon human rights, and therefore would serve as an efficient and independent source of referrals to the Monitor. For example, through its work with Arab and Muslim Australians, the Australian Human Rights Commission is familiar with concerns that counter-terrorism legislation can have a disproportionate impact on the rights of members of particular communities. This information could form the basis of a referral to the Monitor, who in turn, possesses unique information gathering powers that allow him or her to speak with the agencies responsible for implementing these laws and to comprehensively review the practical impact of counter-terrorism laws on individual rights. By providing the commission with the power to refer matters to the Monitor, this bill will ensure that the parliament and the public have the best available information on which to assess Australia's proposed and existing counter-terrorism laws. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens have analysed and critiqued this government's national security agenda—which has been catalysed by the violence of Islamic State militants and the threat of returning 'foreign fighters', as they have been called. We have consistently condemned the brutality of Islamic State. By no means do we seek to minimise the terror this regime is inflicting and inciting. But neither do we want to pass rushed and poorly crafted national security legislation which has serious implications for some of the most basic rights and freedoms of Australians: whether and where people travel, the circumstances in which people can be detained and questioned by ASIO, customs officials or the police and what kind of personal information is captured and stored.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This government's approach to national security legislation has been rushed, to say the least. Inquiries conducted through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security have featured unworkable deadlines for those wishing to make submissions</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the case of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>while this legislation was also referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry, the government senators on this committee made the decision not to hold hearings or accept submissions on this bill. This meant that crossbenchers were not able to participate in any inquiry into this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens are firmly of the view that there must be a greater level of scrutiny and oversight of proposed national security legislation. Strengthening the position of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is a crucial step in this direction. As currently drafted, the main purpose of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act is to ensure that Australia's counter-terrorism and national security laws operate in an effective and accountable manner, are consistent with Australia's international obligations, including human rights, counter-terrorism and international security obligations, and to help to maintain public confidence in those laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recent uncertainty around the position of the INSLM has risked undermining this legislative aim. This bill aims to ensure the legislative aim of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act is realised—giving the Australian community confidence that Australia's counter-terrorism and national security laws are operating effectively and accountably, and in a manner consistent with Australia's international obligations, including human rights obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in the bill's statement of compatibility with human rights, the bill is consistent with the protection and promotion of many rights and freedoms subject to scrutiny under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011</span>. The bill also aligns with world's best practice for ensuring consistency between counter-terrorism laws and human rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Counter-terrorism and national security laws seek to promote and protect human rights by empowering law enforcement and intelligence agencies to deter, prevent, and disrupt activities that would endanger the safety or lives of the Australian community. Measures to combat terrorism may also impact human rights and the rule of law. The negative impact of counter-terrorism laws on human rights in Australia can be observed in the report prepared by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in respect of the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. The human rights impact of this legislation was extensive and deep, prompting some experts to make submissions recommending the bill should not have passed without significant changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The rights to freedom of expression, of association, of equality and non-discrimination – and many other human rights – were engaged or limited by what was colloquially known as the 'Foreign Fighters' bill. And it is well known that counter-terrorism laws, like other laws, can permissibly limit rights, provided the limitation is in accordance with human rights law. As the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has explained:<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">International human rights law allows for reasonable limits to be placed on most rights and freedoms, although some absolute rights cannot be limited.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">All other rights may be limited as long as the limitation is reasonable, necessary and proportionate to the achievement of a legitimate objective. This is the analytical framework the committee applies when exercising its statutory function of examining bills for compatibility with human rights.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Having an independent, well-resourced INSLM will contribute significantly to this framework, ensuring that Australia's counter-terrorism laws can be independently scrutinised by someone with the expertise and access to information necessary to identify any adverse impacts on human rights and suggest alternative mechanisms for achieving any legitimate legislative ends. I implore Senators to consider the sensible amendments proposed by this bill and the real outcomes that could be achieved by the passage of this bill. The position of Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is a significant one and must be strengthened to ensure the best legislative outcomes possible. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the heart of a strong merits review system is an independent generalist tribunal boasting a range of specialist expertise.  This is the direction initiated with the establishment of the AAT in 1976.  The intention at that time was to have a single independent tribunal dealing with merits review of administrative decisions across a wide spectrum of Commonwealth activity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 1995 the Administrative Review Council (ARC) Better Decisions report recommended that various specialist tribunals should be united as a single review tribunal comprising a number of specialists divisions.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ARC considered that a single merits review tribunal would combine the best features of existing tribunals. It would lead to better decisions, remove unwarranted duplication and be simpler for the public.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 2014–15 budget measure Smaller government—additional reductions in the number of Australian Government bodies outlined the intention to amalgamate tribunals into a single tribunal.

                  </a>  I commend the YWCA for the work they do to empower young women and girls to aspire to leadership positions. I also commend the 1,600 girls and young women who participated in the She Speaks survey and brought to life a number of important issues on leadership discrimination and safety. The government is proud to support a range of programs for the benefit of women and girls across government, including providing $450,000 to support the Every Girl program which aims to empower girls aged nine to 14 from disadvantaged areas to become confident engaged leaders who are active in their communities. The policies of the government show a clear commitment to improving outcomes for all women and girls in Australia and globally. I also note that this government's new approach to overseas development assistance requires 80 per cent of investments, regardless of their objectives, to effectively address gender issues in their implementation.</span>

Australia is playing its part in an effective international response to climate change through direct action, including our $2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund, international engagement and our aid program.

Australia is playing its part in an effective international response to climate change through Direct Action, including our $2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund, international engagement and our aid program. Unlike many other countries, when we announce a target we meet it. As the government has previously said often, we will be announcing our post-2020 target next year once we have considered what other countries are doing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I rise today to speak about the MPI, to talk about the Abbott government's barnacles and their budget of broken promises. It is an inconvenient truth: a promise broken is a broken promise, and, despite the Abbott government's pathetic attempts to outright deny and lie, they have broken promises. Despite their convoluted language—calling cuts and broken promises something else—voting Australians know that the Abbott government has broken promise after promise and that it has made cuts to a range of government services. Voters know fact from fiction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the eve of the federal election Mr Abbott told SBS there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS if the coalition were elected to government. There were of course other pledges during the election campaign. Who could forget that wonderful outburst of 'We are on a unity ticket on Gonski!' But now Australian kids will pay the price of that ripped-up unity ticket, as postcodes will continue to determine educational outcomes—not a fairer funding system. Earlier this week the Prime Minister held his mea culpa media conference and promised us that he would take the barnacles off before Christmas. Despite the Labor opposition asking many questions here in the Senate, one of the barnacles—Senator Johnston, the Minister for Defence—is still here. There are just a couple more sitting days before Christmas if the barnacles are to come off, assuming they require legislation to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is not winning. Despite the Prime Minister's mea culpa, the government is not winning. Its harsh, cruel budget has been well and truly exposed along with its string of broken promises. I think that, when the Prime Minister had a closer look at the barnacles, he realised that it is the whole ship that is sinking. Even if he now removes the barnacles—whether that be the Minister for Defence, backing down on the GP tax, backing down on the cuts to the ABC or backing down on the cuts to education—nothing will save the Abbott government ship, because it has become a ship of fools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday in this place, Labor, along with the Greens and some of the crossbenchers, let the Abbott government know well and truly that the higher education changes in their bill were harsh and unfair. In fact they were just plain wrong. We voted that bill down. But, completely undeterred—the message seemingly is not getting through to the Abbott government—they have fronted up this morning with a new bill. We are not quite sure where it is up to and when we will see it, but we understand that in that bill the massive cuts to universities remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite Labor saying right from day one it would not support the cuts to that higher education bill and despite us having a Senate inquiry and hearing overwhelmingly from universities that the cuts would hurt, seemingly the Abbott government did not hear that. So the cuts remain, the new fee imposts for students remain and nothing of substance has changed, and Labor's position remains unchanged. We will not support the government's second, replica, unfair higher education bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we learned from this new bill is the fact that the government needs to put forward the regional transition fund in and of itself says that what they are proposing is not going to work. We have heard in this place senator after senator and the ministers telling us that competition is good, that making a market out of universities is good. Yet what have they now done? They have suddenly realised that, if they want to go down this track, they have to stump up regional universities because regional universities—in fact all universities except the Group of Eight—told us they would not be able to survive without some sort of transitional fund. The government did not call it a transitional fund. Many of the universities told us they would need that additional funding from the federal government forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was really quite a shock to me and was revealed as an absolute blight on the system when the University of Newcastle told us that, with the cuts being imposed by the federal government, they simply could not recoup those cuts through an increase in fees. That is the Abbott government signing the death warrant of that fine university in Newcastle, a regional university. Yet the Abbott government does not seem to care. Somehow it likes to kid itself that turning universities into a market and making them compete is going to save them, when the evidence we heard at the Senate inquiry was quite contrary to that, with regional universities being very clear about their future, an uncertain future, a future they could not predict. So this nonsense of competition in their higher education market has been exposed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, if we have to stump up taxpayer dollars to take account of these harsh cuts, that says the government's plan for marketisation will not work. It is a failure right from the word go. Just now Universities Australia have put out a media release. Universities Australia strike me as a fairly savvy organisation. They are often here lobbying. They certainly meet with Labor senators and Labor shadows and talk to us about their vision for universities in the future. Guess what they are saying? That this bill does not quite get it right. Bills are not playthings. The government cannot keep putting up bill after bill until they get it right. Voters of Australia demand the government get it right in the first instance. Up until yesterday, Minister Pyne was singing the praises of Universities Australia, telling us how onside they were. Yet today in black and white from Universities Australia we have a media release which says: 'Oops, you haven’t quite got it right, Minister Pyne. The 20 per cent cuts are going to hurt us.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, whatever Kool-Aid Universities Australia drank when the first bill was proposed has worn off, because they are now starting to criticise the government's higher education bill by saying today that this does not get it right, that this does not cut it. And money being put into a transition fund for three years will not cut it either because regional universities have said very clearly that the cuts are going to hurt them. Again this is another broken promise from the Abbott government—'No cuts to education'. We all know there has been a 20 per cent cut to our universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things the Abbott government is quite good at doing—I often wonder which universe they are in. They are obviously in some kind of parallel universe. They do not live in the real world I live in because they like to invent new language for their cuts. Who remembers the increased tax on higher earners, which nobody had an issue with? But it is not an increase in tax; it is a levy. We just use different language because we know that the Abbott government promised no increased taxes. So they kind of think, 'If we call it something else, people will just believe us.' Of course they do not. We can all tell fact from fiction and there is another fiction. It is time the Abbott government realised they are deeply unpopular because their budget is too harsh and cruel on everyday Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator MASON:</span>
                  </a>  About seven years ago, when the Labor Party took office, having won the election in November 2007, they inherited the best books, the best set of national accounts ever inherited by any incoming government in our national history. In 113 years of our national history, they received the best accounts ever with billions and billions of dollars in the bank. When we took over government in September last year, we received the worst national accounts in the history of our nation. They received the best; we received the worst and now we are trying to fix them. The horror is not that Labor spent too much on overpriced school halls, the cash splash and the disastrous pink batts; it is that so many of them do not believe there is a problem at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. They are even, at the moment, sabotaging the government's attempts to repay the debt. We want to do that, and it is being sabotaged. We do know that they have no plan to solve the problem. No plan has been put forward by 'barnacle' Bill Shorten—Mr Shorten—at all. The problem now is not the amount of the debt but the trajectory of the debt. In just over nine years it will reach $667 billion with $3 billion a month in interest. What could we do with that? That is the point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets much worse than that, and this has not been raised in this place. In the history of developing countries, since World War II, no-one has ever repaid a debt of that magnitude. What will happen is that we will become like western Europe and the United States and we will never repay it. We either repay it now or we are a country that is stuck with systemic debt, just like western Europe and the United States. And we will be paying billions of dollars in interest for the privilege. It will become a permanent fixture in our public life. The government will become the centre of the economy—just as Kevin Rudd wished all those years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party profess to be the party of social justice. They have this sort of sense about them that they are the party of social justice—with a touch of moral vanity, I might add. They have argued since May that the budget is not fair for pensioners, students and working families. That is what they say: 'it is not fair'. But I will tell you who it is not fair for. It is not fair for the people who will have to pay the debt. The government believe that this generation should live within their means. We believe that the health, the education and the welfare of our community should be paid for by the community—not by our children and not by our grandchildren. That is the disgrace of a party that talks about social justice and equality: they do not give a damn about our children and our grandchildren. It is not only fiscally reckless but also morally contemptible. But there is a reason for it. The Labor Party know that our children and those yet to be born, of course, cannot vote. They know that. We are standing up for people who cannot yet vote. This lot will never, ever do that. They will put more and more money on the credit card, because they know there are very, very few repercussions of that. Every democratic incentive is not to pay back the debt, because when you pay back debt it causes electoral pain. I accept that; we all accept that. We are paying it back because it is fiscally responsible and morally it is the only way to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe, ultimately, that if pensioners, working families and students think the government is that poor, they will throw us out. That is fine. That is democracy. But what the Labor Party believe and know is this: those who will pay Labor's debt cannot yet vote. They cannot throw the Labor Party out because they cannot yet vote. It is a gutless approach to politics—one that has been adopted by nearly every country in western Europe, including Greece, Portugal, France and Spain, because the politicians of those nations did not have the guts to pay back the debt and they wanted future generations to pay for today's living standards. And that is the solution of the Australian Labor Party. I can put up with the fact that the Labor Party cannot manage a budget. That is a fact.</span>

                  <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise on this matter of public importance to expose some of the nonsense and the rhetoric that we have just heard from Senator Mason. The Prime Minister has said that he is about removing barnacles. I have to say: it is not the barnacles that are the problem. It is the actual ship. This government reminds me of the political equivalent of the old 'ships of shame' that used to come to this country—rust buckets with people in the bilges, trying to pump the bilges out on a continuous basis. It is not the barnacles; it is the ship. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Mason said, 'merry Christmas'. I have to say that it will not be a merry Christmas for the pensioners who are getting indexation reduced by this government. It will not be a merry Christmas for those who need and rely on the health system, with $50 billion cut out of the health system. It will not be a merry Christmas for kids in needy schools, with $50 billion cut out of schools over 10 years. It will not be a merry Christmas for those students who would have been facing $100,000 a year to get an education if we had not stopped that crazy proposition from this coalition government. It will not be a merry Christmas for those workers at the ABC and SBS who are losing their jobs because the government cannot lie straight in bed. It will not be a merry Christmas for the poor in this country, or the unemployed, or the vulnerable because they are, according to this government, the 'leaners'. They are leaning on people. This is a government with no compassion, no common sense and no economic credibility, and I will not be lectured by the coalition about economic credibility. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a coalition that under Peter Costello and John Howard just threw the rule book out the door. It was tax cut after tax cut after tax cut, with no building for the future. There was no investment in schools, no investment in infrastructure and no investment in health. That was not the way for this country to get ahead and look after future generations. It was short-termism of the worst nature, a lack of political vision and certainly no political values. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget takes from the have-nots and gives to those that have got it. The so-called 'contribution' of a politician or a high-income earner—on three times the average wage—to this government's budget repair is $29 a week. People earning $200,000 or $300,000-plus are paying $29 a week. That is one per cent of their disposable income. But if you are a single-income couple with two school-age children on average earnings—guess what?—you pay $90 a week. That is the contribution of single-income families with a couple of kids at school under this government. That is six per cent of their disposable income. Where is the fairness in that? How can anyone trust a government who does this? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government who did not tell the Australian public about any of the policies they would introduce after the election. This is a government who systematically lied to the Australian public. They told the Australian public that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and not cuts to the ABC, no cuts to SBS and no cuts to pensions. Yet what do they do? When they get into government, they rip and tear at our education system, our health system and the poorest people in this country. They are really the political equivalent of the ships of shame. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a government that is forever on reset, forever on reboot, forever on remessage. Now they are on barnacle removal duty. What a rabble this mob is! What an absolute rabble! They are untrustworthy. They have lied their way into power. If the public had known what this government was going to do, they would not be sitting on the government benches now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer only opens his mouth to change feet. His foot is always in his mouth. The government just does not get the message. They have not got the message from the Victorian election. The Australian public are just not buying the budget or the poor sales job. It is not about the sales job; it is about the policies. The policies are bad. The budget is a shocker. The budget is unfair. The government cannot be trusted. This is the problem with this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then what do they do? They rely on the rhetoric from Senator Mason about bad economic management. They just failed to tell anyone that there was a global financial crisis. They just failed to tell people that governments all over the world had to invest in keeping people in jobs. No, that was not mentioned. In fact, they argued here it was only a North American crisis; they said there was not a crisis in Australia at all. Yet business could not get any investment; funds were drying up; the market was grinding to a halt. It was only the Labor Party in government that fixed that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are not getting the message. The message is: the Senate is not going to pass your GP tax. The Senate does not like your cuts to health. The Senate does not like your cuts to schools. We do not like you beating up on the poor and the vulnerable. These are the issues that are important to the Australian public. No matter what they are told, this government is completely deaf to the real issues for ordinary Australians. They are completely out of touch. It is a government in utter chaos. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about a year of achievement. It has been a year of achievement for the government! You have chased the auto industry out of the country. You have trashed billions of dollars of investment in renewable energy projects. You have reopened tax loopholes for multinational tax avoiders. You have doubled the budget deficit even before your disastrous budget was handed down in May. You broke every promise you ever made. And there is not a South Australian senator in here that stands up for jobs in South Australia, because they are too weak-kneed and jelly-backed to actually stand up to a bad budget and bad decisions by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have trashed the trust of the voters. That is their achievement. They are significant achievements. They have proved that you cannot govern without ideas, you cannot govern on three-word slogans and you cannot govern if you tell lies. That is what this government is: completely out of touch. They are so out of touch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals are out of touch, but the National Party is all at sea. They have gone from being the wombats—you know, the tough guys: the Sinclairs, the Anthonys and the Nixons—to being the doormats. That is what they are. Senator O'Sullivan, you are no Sinclair. Senator Canavan, you are no Doug Anthony. And, Senator McKenzie, you will never be as good as Nixon was at looking after country people. You are the doormats. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is that clearer than when you hear Senator Canavan get excited—being from Rockhampton you would think the senator would be interested in things like making sure the agriculture minister's botched handling of the farm household assistance and drought funding was fixed. But, no, Senator Canavan comes in here and makes speeches about Hayekian philosophy. He talks about currency competition. He talks about Friedman. This is awful. I am sure listeners to the Senate broadcast in Central Queensland in Biggenden are glued to the radio, listening to Senator Canavan. Senator Canavan is not representing Biggenden; he is representing the big end of town. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  It grieves me, but I am glad to actually participate in this ridiculous debate where, once again, the Labor Party trots out its tired lines—although I am quite excited about some of the adjectives those opposite have chosen to throw into today's motion. But I think it is actually merely disguising the fact that the Labor Party, straight after the federal election, completely reset the clock on how this nation is to be configured. Those opposite actually forgot about the previous six years, chose to say they did not count. Any responsibility borne for the mess we are now in, they will not be held accountable for. It is an absolute shell, a fig leaf, if you like, that is actually about hiding the facts behind what we are having to deal with as a government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that we are delivering on our promises and those opposite do not like to hear it. We were elected to fulfil a most crucial of promises and that was to repair the sea of debris, the oceans of debt and the tsunami of deficits that were faced by this nation thanks to their absolute incompetence. It was incompetence on a scale never before seen in this nation. We had school halls built at triple the cost of anywhere else. Money was thrown out hand over fist. And now they choose to use the fig leaf of the 'financial crisis'. That was not the case. It was actually press release politics on the most ridiculous scale. I cannot believe it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the facts. The facts were that we did not have $50 billion in the bank. We had $200 billion of net debt when we took government 12 months ago and $667 billion of gross debt. The last six years that landed our government in the most precarious of positions. We have been battling against and are achieving against that position for the betterment—as Senator Mason mentioned in his contribution—of future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not going to be bound by the political cycle. We are going to be bound by principles, which will underpin the future competitiveness of young Australians who cannot vote. Many of them are unemployed right now. Right through regional Australia there is high unemployment. We are seeking to build a positive future for them and to give them options in education, in training, in trades and, indeed, in higher education to ensure that they can access those opportunities so that they can contribute to increased productivity and enjoy all the positive outcomes that work will provide. The debt of the former government was the fastest accrual of debt in dollar terms as a share of GDP in modern Australia. It was not that it was the highest—although it was by a significant amount—but, man, was it quick. Like a catamaran versus a mirror, it was just absolutely phenomenal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government is interested in doing is delivering on the very real promises we made at the last election to the Australian people that they voted for and that those opposite have continually frustrated in this place. Those opposite continually frustrate in their pious attempts to forget the past. Like deluded adolescents, they forget the past. It was the responsibility of those opposite and therefore those opposite have a responsibility in this place to lend a shoulder to the wheel to help us to repair the debt and deficit that those opposite left us so that we can as a society, as a parliament, build a positive future for young Australians. They were shallow slogans from Senator Cameron, but do we expect anything else?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also sorted out the growing regulatory burden, and it is not just on business. Higher education complained of the regulatory burden. The old friends of those opposite, the school sector, the AEU even—I think Angelo got on board—started complaining and bringing to the fore the regulatory burden that the former government placed not only business but on the environment, on higher education, on schools. Right throughout our society, the former government's stranglehold reduced our competitiveness, reduced our productivity and our ability to make productivity gains.

All those workers at SPC Ardmona and all the workers in the dairy industry were so thankful for getting rid of that carbon tax.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the matter of public importance debate this afternoon about the Abbott government's budget of barnacles and broken promises. I would like to follow on from Senator Mason, who wished everyone a Merry Christmas. While it is a very noble expression of goodwill, it is a shame this government has not demonstrated any since being in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to reflect on those people who have lost their jobs in my home state of Tasmania under this government. There have been countless Tasmanians who have lost their jobs. Thousands and thousands of pensioners around this country were lied to before the election. They were told that there would be no changes to the pension, just as people were told that there would be no new taxes—'not under my government', according to Mr Abbott. The list goes on. Those people who are unemployed will face a very bleak Christmas. But with the changes this government tried to introduce, it would have been much darker. This is a government that is heartless and it is harsh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those people who work with the ABC and SBS and their families—those tens of hundreds of Australians who work for those two institutions—are going to have a very bleak Christmas. This was the government and this was the Senate that tried to pass a budget and has failed to do that since May—and they still have not. Why has the budget not passed? Why have those bills not been passed? It is because the Australian people know that they were lied to. They were lied to by Tony Abbott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to reflect on Mr Abbott's performance on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> show this week. It was really quite interesting. It is not a show that I watch that often. But to have the Prime Minister, in a very sincere way and even with a straight face, complain about the Senate being obstructionist towards them! He said that the Labor opposition was in a 'feral mood'. That is the biggest—the biggest!—case of the pot calling the kettle black that I have ever heard!. It is not often that I actually agree with Karl Stefanovic, but I think he hit the nail on the head this week when his response to the Prime Minister was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With respect you were fairly feral in opposition ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the truth. That is precisely what those people who are now sitting on that side of the chamber were when they were in opposition. They were negative, negative, negative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the <span style="font-style:italic;">Toda</span>y show are scoring important points off Mr Abbott, the situation must be getting pretty desperate. Perhaps it is time that Mr Abbott gave up? Recently, we have also heard that the Prime Minister says he needs to take care of a few 'barnacles' on the ship before Christmas. I think that Senator Cameron was quite right: it is not the barnacles on the ship, it is the ship that is on its way down to the bottom of the ocean, along with its captain and a few of the lieutenants—or should I say 'chief petty officers' on that side? They are going to find themselves in the drink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, the government promised and said, 'We're on a unity ticket with the Labor Party. There will be no cuts to education.' But we have seen the first attempt in this government's plan to wreck higher education in this country. Yesterday we also learnt that there was a deal being discussed that would see federal money going towards a revamp of the University of Tasmania, in my home state. Well, that is all very well, but if it were not for the government abolishing the Education Investment Fund in the first place such drastic action would not be needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have to say that we have not seen any real detail, and I have no confidence at all in the 'three amigos'—the members for Bass, Braddon and Lyons—to be able to negotiate anything with this government to ensure that there is adequate funding going to the University of Tasmania. This government has ripped $30 million out of the university's budget in Tasmania. My colleagues, senators Brown, Singh, Urquhart and Bilyk, and I have no confidence at all in the three amigos. And I know that the Tasmanian community does not have any confidence at all in those three amigos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we should not be fooled, because we know that the higher education changes will make a university education inaccessible for many people. As I have said earlier this week, going to university should be based on your talent and hard work, not how big a cheque book your parents have or how big a credit card you have. It should be your talent that decides whether or not you should be able to continue and have the opportunity of a tertiary education. Scraping off one or two of the barnacles will not be enough. As I said, it is not the barnacles that are the problem: it is the ship and the captain. I have to say that this ship is sinking fast, and there is no harbour in sight. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that no-one is taking charge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to remember—it has to be 6½ months ago now—that the Australian people listened to the Treasurer bringing down his budget. But they do not buy it: they did not buy it in May, they did not buy it in June and they did not buy it in July, August, September, October or November. And they certainly are not buying it now. We know that this budget was made up of nothing but broken promises—promises that were made, I would have thought, in good faith, to the Australian community. But what we have seen is that there was deception and deceit by the Prime Minister and his Treasurer. Quite frankly, I think it is pretty obvious that they are both out of their depth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look once again at the proposed GP tax—another tax. But those people on the other side said during the election campaign that there would be no new tax, and that there would be no cuts to health and no cuts to education. The leadership team still do not know: is there going to be a GP tax or is there not going to be a GP tax? One thing I do know is that if they do bring such legislation into this chamber that we will fight tooth and nail to prevent it. That tax will hurt the most vulnerable people in our community. But, no, those on the other side—what did they say?—they said they were going to be the 'adults' in government. They were going to be the adults! I have to say that they are not even behaving as well as children in pre-kinder would, because they have no idea. They have no vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how heartless they are, because there is not a sector in our community that has not been hit. And there is the uncertainty—because these people do not care. I have heard it firsthand from people working in pharmacies and the pharmacists themselves, saying, 'Older Australians are concerned about whether or not they are going to be able to afford their medication.' They are going to their pharmacists—</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator POLLEY:</span>
                  </a>  This is serious! You may laugh on the other side, but this is quite serious! They are asking in the pharmacies whether or not they need to take all of their tablets. That is serious!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, those people on the other side have misled the Australian people. They have misled them and, in fact, this is not only about misleading them: they have lied. Those opposite can never again criticise Labor for being dysfunctional and uncertain. They can never again launch attacks on internal tensions on the other side. They can never again claim that they are the party of stability. Most of all, they can never again claim that they are a party of no surprises and no excuses, because they have fallen; and how mighty those on the other side are when they fall—they fall very hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is also incredible is that at least some of those on the frontbench, including the Treasurer, are committed to persisting with the GP tax. He wants it to go ahead. As I have said in this place on a number of occasions, this is going to hurt people in my home state. This is a short-sighted tax because it is going to hurt those who can least afford to be hurt. It is going to hit pensioners, it is going to hit low-income families and it is going to hit people with chronic illnesses in particular. No parent should have to decide whether or not they can take their child to see a doctor simply because they do not have a large enough credit card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not stop there. My area of responsibility is aged care, and we on this side know they have lied to this sector. They took away the dementia supplement that was paid to the providers; they said a new scheme would come in, but we have seen nothing of that. The fact that they have changed the way pensions will be indexed will affect the aged-care sector as well. We are still waiting for those in government to come into this chamber— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I feel sorry for them; I think they need counselling or some type of help. They get into office and they spend, spend and spend. If you look at the history of this country, it is the Labor Party, now with their good friends the Greens, who constantly destroy the economy. Look at 1931: when we got back in after Joseph Scullin we had to clean up the mess. Look at 1949: we stopped the Labor Party from trying to nationalise the banks—imagine the damage that would have done to the economy. Look at 1975: the damage of Gough Whitlam—Saint Gough. Look at what he did with that three-year Labor administration—compared to the administration in this country between 2007 and 2013, it was probably quite a good Labor administration—the second worst Labor government on record. We had the Hawke-Keating government, which left this country in 1996 with $96 billion worth of debt. We got to 2013 and, once again, the cavalry came along. We had the Liberals and Nationals, the coalition, elected to clean up Labor's mess. And it is Labor's mess.

So when they get into power it is like they have won Gold Lotto every Saturday night. When Labor are in power they think, 'We've got all this money to spend and we can spend it on all our crazy schemes'. Let us talk about the carbon tax and how that did not work; let us talk about how it destroyed the Australian economy. Let us talk about the mining tax, the world's craziest tax since the Georgians had the window tax. This tax raised very, very little money.

But let us be clear: what we have heard are carping and cliches from the other side. What we have not heard is an alternative. What we have not heard is a different plan. What we have not heard is one new idea from those opposite about how we can put this country on the best fiscal path possible—that has been missing from the contributions of Labor senators today. They would like you to believe that we should erase from our memory the last six years of Labor rule across this country—six years dominated by poor policy, poor implementation and a string of budget deficits. They would like you to ignore that from the current fiscal challenge that faces our nation. They refuse to admit that the country has a debt and deficit disaster. They refuse to admit that it is a disaster of their own making. Importantly, they reject what four Labor leaders have said. And I will come to that in a moment.

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Shorten opposition still fails to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem. It plays semantic games questioning whether our deteriorating fiscal situation is a genuine budget emergency. It ignores the copious evidence that a political tipping point is reached long before an economic crisis becomes a reality …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">a painless option in terms of getting the budget back to surplus. Of course, we know the truth: there is no pain free way, unfortunately, to correct the economic vandalism and recklessness of the former government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  I just cannot thank Senator Moore enough for the opportunity to draw attention and put the spotlight on the absolutely impoverished government that was the Labor government of the last six years. The interesting thing to reflect upon is that there were three prime ministers in that time—Mr Rudd followed by Ms Gillard followed by Mr Rudd. Two of the prime ministers were actually gotten rid of by Labor's own caucus. They did not even give the Australian people the opportunity to get rid of them; they just waited until 2013 to do that—so hypocrisy writ large. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think of Kevin Rudd, what comes to mind? You think of pink batts and the terrible loss of four lives, and you think of billions of dollars. You think, of course, of the $900 and the $1, 200 cheques that were thrown around like confetti. When you think of Ms Gillard, you think immediately of failed memorial halls, many of which are falling down now—another $13 billion of taxpayers' money. Then you have the quinella—the Wayne Swan and Senator Penny Wong quinella, the worst Treasurer and finance minister combination in Australia's history who took a surplus of $22 billion and turned it into a massive debt who took an economy that had no net debt and created $200 billion of accumulated deficits who managed to put us in a position where we are borrowing a billion dollars a month. That is two new primary schools a day, seven days a week. What a wonderful opportunity Senator Moore has given us! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go on. We now think of Mr Shorten. As Minister for Workplace Relations he destroyed Australian jobs and watched unemployment go up as a result of his bad industrial laws. We think of Senator Ludwig, who, with no compassion and no thought, trashed not just Australia's international reputation but the live cattle industry—from which we are yet to recover.</span>

                  </a>  And then—right on cue, thank you very much—comes Senator Conroy with his failed NBN scheme that of course did not need to go to tender! Certainly in many instances he did not bother going to tender. Then there was Australia's overseas media operation, which is a fair dinkum disgrace, incidentally—Bananas in Pyjamas! Senator Conroy, having set up a tender, interfered in the process. He reversed the tender result and gave it to the ABC—and we know what the end result was.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a look at what we came into government to do. We said we would get rid of the shocking mining tax—a tax that was earning no income. We did it. We said we would get rid of the carbon tax and return money to Australian consumers and return confidence to the Australian electricity system. We have done it. We said that we would turn the boats around and take control of our borders again. We have done it. We said we would repair the budget—and who is standing on the hose of that process?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question becomes one of how this government is performing. Let me spell it out. We have reduced that shocking projected debt, moving to $600 billion, by $300 billion. With infrastructure, we have committed $50 billion which will leverage up to $125 billion. We are already seeing it around Australia—something Labor was never capable of doing. On the state reforms and asset recycling, which were the first two territories or states to put their hands up for this asset recycling? The Labor led ACT and the Labor led South Australian governments. Isn't that amazing! We have privatised Medibank Private to put those funds back into working for the Australian community. We have got rid of 57,000 pages of red tape, with a saving of $2 billion a year. With Mr Andrew Robb, who is back on a plane now, incidentally, we have managed to put together three free trade agreements with three of our most important trading partners. A trillion dollars of environmental approvals, some 300 major projects, are all now underway. Last time around, Labor could not do it. We have reintroduced an employee share scheme to operate from 1 July—once again giving employees in businesses in this country the opportunity to share even further in the benefits. We have removed 100 Labor tax measures that went back to 2002. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So where are we are now in terms of business confidence? Business confidence and consumer confidence are back at their long-term averages. Retail trade is going upwards. Housing approvals are the best in 10 years. Where are the barnacles? If there are barnacles, who contaminated the waters? Who roughened the hull of this ship called 'Australia'? This mob on the other side did it. We are in a situation now where our terms of trade have deteriorated relative to the terms of trade experienced by the former government. Can you imagine for a minute if this crowd were let back in charge of the purse strings? It would be a catastrophe.</span>

It is a substantial report—almost 1,000 pages—with a total of 83 recommendations. So there is much to consider. The Australian Greens will be looking at it very closely. However, it is already clear to me that the Productivity Commission's report runs counter to the Commonwealth government's current agenda of funding cuts and advocacy restrictions. I will come to both of these in a minute.</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens firmly believe that access to justice is a cornerstone of a modern democratic society. We know that a fair and just society with equality before the law does not just happen. Every year, half a million Australians miss out on essential legal services and hundreds of thousands of others never pursue justice because the legal system is just too complex and too expensive. These problems have been recognised by the Productivity Commission in this report. The Productivity Commission recognises that access to justice is no longer just an issue for traditionally disadvantaged people, such as people who are poor, new arrivals or those who have disabilities or mental illness. It talks about the 'missing middle'—middle-income Australians who do not qualify for legal aid but also do not have the cash for large and unexpected legal costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission report raises a number of ways we can address this issue and the broader challenges with access to justice. I would like to speak briefly to two of these. The first is increased funding for legal assistance services and the second is the efficiency of advocacy and law reform work by those services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report has recommended additional funding from Commonwealth, state and territory governments of around $200 million a year for legal assistance services to be used for better alignment of the means test used by legal aid commissions with other measures of disadvantage, to maintain existing front-line services that have a demonstrated benefit to the community and to allow legal assistance providers to offer a greater number of services in areas of law that have not previously attracted funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly important to note that the commission has noted that belt-tightening and tough financial circumstances are not an excuse to scrimp on legal assistance. The report says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not providing legal assistance in these instances can be a false economy as the costs of unresolved problems are often shifted to other areas of government spending such as health care, housing and child protection. Numerous Australian and overseas studies show that there are net public benefits from legal assistance expenditure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I would like to note that the Australian Greens are very pleased that this report has recognised, from an economic perspective, that advocacy and law reform work are an efficient use of government funding. I have had arguments with Senator Brandis, the Attorney-General, many, many times about this issue. But I hope the fact that Australia's Productivity Commission has set out the case for advocacy will enable this government to now see sense and reverse its nonsensical and purely ideological restrictions on the use of Commonwealth funds for this purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quoting from the report again:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Frontline service delivery should be prioritised, along with advocacy work where it efficiently and effectively solves systemic issues which would otherwise necessitate more extensive individualised service provision … The Australian, State and Territory Governments should provide funding for strategic advocacy and law reform activities that seek to identify and remedy systemic issues and so reduce demand for frontline services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Australian Greens' spokesperson for legal affairs, I have spoken consistently about the need to reform and improve access to justice since coming to this place. I care deeply about supporting and strengthening community legal services so that every Australian can seek justice to ensure that legal issues can be resolved on the merits of their claim and not the size of their wallet. It is fundamental to our democracy that our legal system is open to everyone who has been wronged and is seeking a fair outcome, not just those who happen to have big incomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope I will be speaking to this place again soon about these issues, but next time I hope that I will be speaking in support of Commonwealth reforms based on this Productivity Commission report to help take us down the path to improved access to justice. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the Department of the Environment's report of the expert panel on a declared commercial fishing activity: final (small pelagic fishery) declaration 2012. One of the first things I did as a new senator was seek a meeting with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority after I had been approached by a number of fishermen and environment groups about the arrival of a very famous large floating industrial factory fishing vessel—at that stage called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Margiris</span>—a supertrawler that had been dogged by controversy for years all around the world, especially off West Africa. It was flagged in shady places and very little was known about its management or ownership. I asked AFMA this question: 'Did the proponents of the supertrawler seek to have the quota for the small pelagic fishery doubled in this country?' Coincidentally, around the arrival of the supertrawler, the government had doubled the quota from 10,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes. I was told at that meeting that that had nothing to do with it. It was laughed off. Senator Colbeck was also at this meeting. Then about a month later we found out through a freedom-of-information request that, indeed, a letter had been written by Seafish directly to AFMA asking them to double the quota so they could bring a supertrawler to this country. That may have been a coincidence, but it was enough to raise red flags with me and get me very concerned and make me want to look into a lot more detail about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was hoping the report we have in front of us today would be the end of this journey that I have been on on the supertrawler campaign with Senator Siewert, the Greens and literally millions of Australians. This report shows very clearly that the scientific work assessing the risks that the unprecedented arrival of a large floating factory vessel like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Margiris</span>, later flagged as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Abel Tasman</span>, showed that it was too risky. Considerable uncertainty existed in this fishery. We said this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to what you said in your speech in here the other day, Acting Deputy President Edwards, the fishery they were targeting, the small pelagic fishery off Tasmania, had been totally underutilised for a decade. It had been in collapse prior to that. There are disputes as to whether that was due to ocean current temperatures or overfishing. Nevertheless, it had been in collapse. There had not been fish for 10 years and it had not been studied. One desktop report was published around the arrival of the supertrawler saying it was safe for it to go fishing. Blind Freddy could see that there had been no data collection and there had been no fishing evidence to even provide adaptive fisheries management around the arrival of an unprecedented supertrawler into this country's waters. So a big campaign started to get this supertrawler stopped, to get it banned, so that we could do some scientific work around the potential risks and the potential uncertainties. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens—along with other stakeholders in this country, including millions of recreational fishing groups as well as people who care about the ocean—have a very strong view that these boats should be banned, that we should not have them in this country and that the onus of proof should be on future proponents to overturn that ban, because no work has been done and evidence only exists at this point for uncertainties. Given how precious our ocean and ecosystems are—not just for human consumption but also in terms of broader impacts on ecosystems, especially around protected species and seals and dolphins—it is important that we listen to what the Australian public are saying, that we listen to what the scientists are saying in this report, that we acknowledge the uncertainties, that we acknowledge the campaign and the role of the Greens in this country, and that we have these supertrawlers banned. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all the witnesses and people who provided submissions to the inquiry. I also thank the secretariat of the committee for the hard work that they put into this inquiry and into helping us pull the report together. Unfortunately, I have presented a report that is not a consensus report. I have presented a majority report from the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party. As part of that report, the coalition have a dissenting report, which I am sure Senator Seselja will speak to. As chair, I have also made some additional comments on behalf of the Australian Greens, which I will come to shortly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First off, I would like to outline the report and the key findings of the report. We had 64 submissions, which presented very valuable evidence to this committee. We also held hearings and took evidence from around Australia, which, again, presented us with a lot of evidence. We also made sure that we went to some of those areas with high rates of unemployment that have been identified as priority areas for some of the employment programs that the government is introducing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence before the committee showed that income inequality in this country has increased since the mid-1980s. The evidence also showed that the likely impact of the budget measures will exacerbate income inequality and poverty in Australia and that the Henderson poverty line and the 50 per cent of median income poverty line indicate that there are far too many vulnerable Australians—individuals and families in receipt of income support—who are currently living in poverty. The evidence provided to the committee also shows that the level of Newstart payment is too low. The income of a single adult Newstart recipient is now more than $100 below both the Henderson poverty line and the 50 per cent of median income poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We made findings on the importance of the minimum wage and that it remains an important mechanism for low-income people to avoid poverty and participate in society. The evidence shows that the minimum wage makes a significant difference to income inequality and rates of poverty, and it is important that the minimum wage is set at a level that reflects the rising cost of living in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a socioeconomic gradient associated with a large range of health outcomes. Poor health outcomes are recorded for those with low incomes, and a focus on preventive health and improved access to primary health care, especially for lower-income people, will assist in lifting a number of these measures. We also looked at people who are in particular groups of disadvantage, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people living with mental illness, single parents and newly arrived migrants and who are more vulnerable to poverty and disadvantage. We also found that lower transfer payments or a low income often compounds the extent of disadvantage felt by people in those particular groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We looked too at the impact of not being able to gain employment—and that obviously has very significant impacts—but we also received evidence that insecure, casual, temporary, short-term contracts impacts on people on low incomes so that they become subject to income inequality. We considered what could work for people in helping them to access employment. A lot of evidence talked about the need to access stable employment and the impact employment has on people's income status and inequality. We also looked at issues such as the impact that affordable housing and stable housing can have on people's prospects and life outcomes and inequality. Further, we considered the mobility of labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee made 13 recommendations around issues such as an analysis of the budget and its impact on income inequality. We also recommended that income support measures in the current budget do not proceed. Those budget measures include moving young people off income support for six months, indexation of parenting payments single and changes to the indexation of pension payments. We also looked at the impact of inequality on older Australians. We made recommended that the changes to the GP co-payment and to higher education do not proceed. The majority report also recommended that the Australian government review the level of working age payments to examine the rate of payment to the poverty line. While I agree with that recommendation, the Australian Greens submitted additional comments that Newstart and youth allowances need to be increased. The evidence on that point was absolutely overwhelming because of the impact that the low rate of Newstart and youth allowance has on people's poverty and opportunities to gain employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that my colleagues on the committee will bring out other points in the report. I will run out of time to do justice to all the issues that we considered, but one of the key points that I would like to highlight is that not only is it clear that income inequality has increased, but that people assume that if this country does better, then—and we heard this expression a lot—with the rising tide all the boats rise. In fact, the evidence we received does not support that. It is very clear from a report which was released during our inquiry by the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre that income inequality in my home state of Western Australia has risen and it has risen more than anywhere else in the country. Their report relates that directly to the mining boom. In fact they have done two reports that were relevant to this inquiry—one on the impact of the boom in Western Australia and one on income inequality. They used the median line of poverty as 30 per cent. The point that they make really clearly is that the benefits of the boom have not been shared across all the quintiles and that those in the lowest quintiles have not received the benefits of the boom. In fact, income inequality has increased in Western Australia and that fact is connected directly with the mining boom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the sorts of issues that need to be addressed. Our recommendations consider this and also the way to address housing and education, as well as improving support for unemployed people. Another recommendation is for case management for unemployed people, and there was overwhelming evidence that the individualised approach is by far the best. We also considered the impact the taxation system on inequality and, when the government issues its white paper on taxation reforms, it needs to consider that impact. From the evidence it is clear that government policies on taxation can have a direct impact on income inequality. The bottom line is that income inequality has significant negative effects and that it actually helps our economy if we reduce income inequality. I commend the report to the Senate and urge senators and the broader community to read the report.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  The coalition senators did provide a dissenting report. There are a number of reasons for that, and I want to go through some of those. I preface my remarks by saying that there is no doubt that, when we look at overseas experience, particularly in developing nations, and see one part of society that is dirt poor and another part that is fabulously wealthy, no-one sees that as a good thing. So let's make that clear. Let me also make clear that there are many Australians who do it tough. We want to see that those who are doing it toughest are given the opportunity to better their circumstances, to have the best possible opportunities to put a roof over their heads, to feed their families, to educate their families, to have good health care and to have a good standard of living. We in the coalition are constantly working towards this goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where we differ significantly from our opponents on the left of politics is on the issue of how we define these things, in particular when we look at opportunity. Opportunity does not necessarily lead to equal outcomes. Equal opportunity does not mean that everyone does exactly the same, because there are all sorts of factors that go into the relative prosperity of different people in our community. Senator Siewert touched on that when she highlighted the issues in WA. This is where we differ significantly from many of those who made submissions, many of those who gave evidence and many of the findings from the Greens and the Labor Party. Senator Siewert seems to think that the WA experience is a terrible one, that it is a bad one. I take a different view. If you look at the WA figures—they are cited in the report—you will see that, yes, in WA the gross household income of the top eight deciles increased by an average of 46.5 per cent between 2003-04 and 2011-12. In comparison, the bottom two deciles increased—it says 'only increased'—their income by an average of 28 per cent. Yes, the top moved forward more quickly than the bottom, but let us do another comparison. Let us do a comparison with Tasmania, which, based on the Gini coefficient, which is used heavily by those opposite, is in fact the most equal. It is also the poorest.</span>

                    </a>  Could you explain the Gini coefficient to me!</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SESELJA:</span>
                    </a>  I will briefly do it for Senator Conroy's benefit. According to the Gini coefficient, Tasmania is the most equal but it is also the poorest. That is one of the fundamental issues. You can have a Gini coefficient, you can have all these measures that say, 'Tasmania is more equal than WA. Isn't that a wonderful thing?' I would prefer to see an economy growing as quickly as WA's, lifting incomes across the board, than to see Tasmania's economy, which has not been growing but where everyone is more equal. We bring everyone together. We bring everyone down. That is the Left's way of doing things. That is how you make everyone equal. If there is no economic growth we will all be more equal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give some more figures. I completely disagree with Senator Siewert's comment, which is actually talking Australia down. If you look at the economic growth that actually occurred under a former Labor government, the Hawke-Keating government—it was different with the last Labor government—and under the Howard government we did see incomes rising across the board. Isn't that a wonderful thing? Isn't that something we should be celebrating, as those at the bottom see their income going up in real terms? They see their opportunities going up. In some cases, those at the top end are going up a bit faster. Is that really the fundamental issue? Would we rather see the Tasmanian experience, where everyone grows slowly together and grows closer together, or the WA experience, where we see faster growth, a stronger economy and, low and behold, those at the bottom in WA—</span>

                    </a>  I am going to go through some of the statistics. We have a very useful table of incomes that splits up income growth over a period of couple of decades right across the OECD. It is a really useful look at how people are doing. This is real growth in income, so it is above inflation. It is people's actual improvement. It is an OECD comparison. The total population of Australia on average saw incomes go up annually in real terms by 3.6 per cent in that time. That compares very well to the rest of the world. We see that the bottom decile went up by three per cent—the average was 3.6 per cent—and the top decile went up by 4.5 per cent. In that case, yes we have seen the top going up more quickly than the bottom. Let us look at some of the examples given to us as the benchmark by witnesses. The benchmark was the Scandinavian countries. We were told that they were the ones we should be seeking to emulate.</span>

                    </a>  In fact, it is getting worse, Senator Conroy. They are getting less equal. The income of the total population in Finland, for instance, went up by 1.7 per cent and the top decile went up twice as quickly as the bottom. We were told that places like Sweden are wonderful, but there the top went up six times as quickly. So that argument did not really hold water. The ones that really struck me—this goes back to the Tasmanian example—the countries that saw the bottom going up more quickly than the top, so therefore the country was becoming less unequal, were Ireland, Portugal and Spain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see countries whose economies are not doing well becoming more equal. That is at the heart of the debate we are having with our Labor and Greens colleagues. It is not about bringing everyone down. It is not about slowing economic growth so that everyone becomes a little closer together. We should acknowledge, if you look at the last couple of decades of Australia, that we have done well not just in overall economic growth but across the income levels. Across income levels, people have gotten better off. That is something we should be celebrating. We should not be taking the model that is suggested to us in the majority report, that we take the Tasmanian example as somehow being better than the WA example. I completely reject that. That is socialism masquerading as fairness. It is really simply about the redistribution of wealth. We want to see everyone lifted. We want to see everyone given the opportunity to thrive. If you do that, if you create those economic conditions, inevitably some people will do a bit better than others. We should be doing all we can to make sure that there are not blockages to those opportunities so that people can have the opportunity to get a good education, whatever their background, and people can have the opportunity—if they want to—to start a business without the government getting in their way constantly and holding them back. We want to empower Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two people who are given exactly the same opportunities will not always have exactly the same outcomes. That is the way life is. We do not actually resile from that. Some people will choose to put more hours into their business or into their work and they may well get more prosperity. Some people have more luck. In the end, as long as we are having the fundamental conditions that allow people to thrive, we believe that is the way to go and not the model that is suggested to us by those opposite, which is that we bring everyone down and bring everyone closer together. We want to lift everyone up, give everyone the opportunity to thrive and see the whole economy—whether it is the top, the middle or the bottom—all doing well and all having the opportunity to thrive. I think that is a fundamental difference between us and the other side. That is why we did not agree with the majority report. That is why I would commend the dissenting report to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="CDK" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PERIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  I too rise to speak on the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia</span>. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the chair of our committee, Senator Siewert, for her incredible amount of work and extend my thanks to the witnesses who came forward and presented during the committee work. It is really quite interesting listening to both sides of the chamber. Senate Seselja was talking about bringing people together and not leaving people behind. The thing is that in order to do that you need investment. This is what this report is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I decided to get into politics, I did so because I wanted to fight for change. I wanted to address the massive inequalities that exist within Australia. If we cannot acknowledge that these inequalities exist, we are in complete denial of what is real and what is not real in this country. Above all, this report is fundamentally about people—human beings—and it is about providing information that allows us to better understand the compounding impacts of inequality and how it affects people that reside in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry was also concerned with the extent, as we have heard from Senator Siewert, of income inequality in this nation. Primarily, it relates to the gap between those with the highest incomes in this country, those with the lowest incomes in this country and, in some cases, those with no incomes living in this country, as well as the distribution of incomes in the wage-earning population. It was of particular concern to me that these particular groups—which are divided in this society purely because of their income—have a limited ability to gain access to housing, education and employment, which are the fundamental things that play a major role in everyday life for every Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most particular things which, for obvious reasons, were of grave concern to me was the income of the many disadvantaged groups in this country. Some of those disadvantaged groups, which I have spoken out about and advocated for many times, are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; our older citizens who are also jobseekers; people living with a disability; those with mental illness; our refugees; single parents; and disadvantaged women. Many members of these groups are vulnerable to poverty and inequality for many reasons that they simply cannot control. That is why people need a helping hand. We could be arguing until we are blue in the face, but that is a reality of human beings. There are a lot of people out there who will always require a helping hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Typically among the lowest income earners in society, who are disproportionately represented in this report, are those who are recipients of social security and who are also public-housing tenants. The extent of income inequality, its effects and possible remedies relates to a number of policy areas, which involve all three levels of government. One of the things that the report identified was that the minimum wage should remain, as it is an important mechanism for low-income earners to avoid the poverty line and participate in society. Evidence shows that the minimum wage makes a huge difference to income inequality and the rates of poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the minimum wage is set at a level that reflects the rising cost of living in Australia. In particular, in the Northern Territory—my home place—we have a vastly higher cost of living than anywhere else in this country and other Australians. Territorians are paying substantially more for our food, health care, fuel and rent. In fact, the Australian average weekly expenditure on food is $221.50; in Darwin it is $232.80. Another thing that is quite remarkable is that, just outside the region of Darwin, the weekly expenditure of Darwin rural area people on food is $256.90. That is a cost that continues to rise, while the minimum wage remains pretty much static.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory's Council for Social Services' most recent report on the cost of living states that households who depend on remote stores for their shopping are spending more than one-third of their income on food and are paying nearly 50 per cent more on food than urban households. These members of the Territory community are some of the lowest income earners in the country. For example, a family in a remote area that spends $256.90 a week on food may not be able to afford a power card, which is imperative to having power in a remote community, and therefore they do not have electricity for their fridge. In this country, we have fellow Australians who simply cannot afford electricity, which is simply astounding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Income inequality is just one of the many inequalities that has driven poverty faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The current focus of Australian governments is to reduce the level of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's disadvantage across a number of key indicators. This year's 2014 <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report found that progress towards reaching targets on these indicators had been mixed. Income inequality is not the only issue that many people from regional and remote communities are faced with. Unemployment was a big factor in this report, and exclusion from the labour force is also a significant factor, especially in the Northern Territory. The 2011 census found that only 46.2 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were employed, compared with 72.2 per cent of non-Aboriginal Australians. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's unemployment rate was more than double the rate for non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Overcoming income inequality is a process that will require long-term economic and social investment. I encourage the state and territory governments to recognise and act on creating long-term sustainable employment opportunities for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that dignity is enhanced by work. It is important to me that we make every effort to ensure that all Australians have fair access to health care, food security, employment and housing. Without a thorough understanding of the corrosive effects of income inequality, this cannot be achieved. It is incumbent on government to use all of the recommendations of evidence provided in this report to define a better and fairer policy response to inequality, which remains the major social issue facing our country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  I also would like to take a few moments today to talk about the Community Affairs References Committee's inquiry into income inequality. Along with Senator Siewert and Senator Peris, I also would like to thank the witnesses and the secretariat and all those who submitted to the inquiry for the hard work they did. It is quite clear from the statistics, the evidence given at the inquiry and the anecdotal evidence that we as senators hear from the community that there is a growing gap between the least well-off and the most well-off in Australian society. Inequality is growing in assets, incomes, health and education outcomes, and quality of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the committee and as a Senator from Tasmania, it was of particular importance to me to hear evidence from Tasmanian witnesses at the Hobart hearing, but I also heard evidence throughout Australia from other people. The reason it was so important to me was that I understand that Tasmania is highly affected by income inequality—no matter what Senator Seselja might like to portray. Unfortunately, 32 per cent of Tasmanians are in the lowest 20 per cent of income nationally, and 14,000 Tasmanian children are estimated to live in poverty. It is unfortunate that this government used its first budget to pursue an ideological agenda to start the process of removing the social safety nets that have been a fabric of our society since the time of Prime Minister Whitlam. The cruel cuts and broken promises in Mr Abbott's budget will only result in more suffering from Tasmanians—in particular, young job seekers, students and pensioners. Evidence given by Meg Webb from the Tasmanian Council of Social Services highlights just how bad this government's policies are for Tasmania. Ms Webb said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The impact of the 2014-15 federal budget measures are likely to be felt across Tasmania for many years. The reduction in levels of federal funding for health, education and housing through the cessation of a number of national partnership agreements, and the removal of some special purpose payments, will have a significant impact on the Tasmanian budget. In fact, the Tasmanian Treasury estimates that the financial impact of the Australian government's savings initiatives on Tasmania will be $2.1 billion over the next 10 years. Proposed changes to income support will have a significant impact on Tasmanians and Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know how the Tasmanian government members in the other place—Mr Nikolic, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Whiteley—can say that they have been standing up for Tasmania, when their federal Liberal government wants to rip $2.1 billion out of our state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Witnesses at the Hobart hearing included Baptcare, the previously quoted TasCOSS, the Youth Network of Tasmania, and experts of housing business, economics and sociology from the University of Tasmania. These witnesses gave many examples of how Mr Abbott's government is failing Tasmania's most vulnerable. Baptcare were particularly concerned about the effects that the government's policies would have on young Tasmanians, telling the Hobart hearing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> … Baptcare is concerned about measures in the recent federal budget which will increase income inequality, long-term and severe disadvantage, and financial and housing stress amongst our client groups. … We are very concerned that the plans to severely limit eligibility for Newstart and to move to 22- and 23-year-olds to the even lower youth allowance will lead to the loss of rental housing and increase levels of homelessness in the under 30s. And we are concerned that this may aggravate Tasmania's already high youth suicide rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the chamber know just how important education is to lift people out of poverty. That is why Labor in government invested in the Gonski school education reforms and increased funding to higher education. That is why we oppose this government's plans for $100,000 degrees. Dr Blacklow reinforced this view to the committee in the Hobart hearing, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> … education generally is probably one of the key ways to address inequality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, we debated the government's attempts to hike student fees while slashing Commonwealth funding to universities; however, we in this place have to ask ourselves how our policies will affect an individual's access to higher education. Unfortunately, the policies of the Abbott-Liberal government will take away the opportunities for children from low-income families to attend university. This will hit young Tasmanians particularly hard. The representative from the youth network of Tasmania warned the committee of the effect that the government's policies would have on young people from disadvantaged backgrounds accessing higher education. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are definitely of the view that young people, particularly young people of disadvantaged backgrounds, will be less likely to engage in higher education. It will be a goal that is just that more out of reach for many young people, particularly when you think about the difficulty in getting employment, the difficulty in getting affordable housing and things like that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But here, where we have one university, it is going to be very challenging if, under the proposed rules, that university is able to set their own rates and it is then out of reach for many young people. I think that would cause a big problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Hobart hearing the committee also heard evidence about the dramatic effect the coalition's policies would have on the University of Tasmania and Tasmania's reputation as a quality higher education provider. Professor Jacobs, Deputy Associate Dean of the School of Social Sciences at UTAS, told the committee:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The areas which could attract people here are actually not getting the necessary funding to maintain their reputation abroad. The University of Tasmania is a major employer in this state. But the reforms going through the Senate will seriously jeopardise the budget of the University of Tasmania and it will become less attractive internationally for students to come here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's policies on health care will also lead to a greater increase in health inequality in Tasmania. Again I would like to draw from evidence, given by Meg Webb from TasCOSS, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Visits to the GP—primary health care—is the best way to avoid the much more expensive end of acute hospital care. Tasmania more than anywhere else needs to encourage better usage of primary health care. We need nothing to discourage people from attending their GP appointments regularly. A co-payment does that outright. Particularly for people in Tasmania who are on low incomes, who are on allowances and pensions, any level of co-payment required will be a deterrent and that will inevitably lead to worse health outcomes and a much more expensive health system for our state in the long run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know that Tasmanian Senator Abetz does not have any empathy for the young people who are seeking work in Tasmania. He callously told young job seekers they should go fruit picking or move to get a job, but evidence given at the Hobart inquiry would argue against the view that it is easy to get a job. Mr Brendan Churchill, lecturer in social sciences at UTAS, told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For young Tasmanians, if they move and they want to move to a nearest population centre, there is no guarantee that they are actually going to find work. There is no immediate solution. I know Victoria and South Australia are also experiencing similar levels of youth unemployment, so even if they do make the jump to the mainland there is no guarantee that this issue is resolved. It is just one person less that the Tasmanian community has to worry about, which is a shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon members of this place to read this important report. In particular I encourage crossbenchers who are trying to determine if they support a particular policy to read the report and the submissions to this inquiry, because a mountain of evidence was gathered in opposition to the government's policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry got to the root of income inequality in Australia. It demonstrates that inequality is growing across Australia, in particular in rural and regional areas like my home state of Tasmania. The committee heard evidence time and time again about how this government's dysfunctional budget would increase inequality across Australia. I call upon the government to stop its ideological attacks on students, on pensioners, on young job seekers and on those who are not as well off as them and to start delivering policies to support all Australians, not just their mates in big business. I call upon the government to return to the ideal of Australia as an egalitarian society where we help those who are in trouble and where everyone receives a fair go because that is the Australian way.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I will only talk briefly on this report. I think it is important we do so, because in terms of this particular report this is an ongoing discussion on issues that were raised over many years in the past. I think the reason it has formulated discussion in our Senate is some focus that has been put on the issue by a meeting that was held earlier this year by a group called Australia 21, which called upon the Australian community to look at the issues of income distribution in our nation. Part of the whole reason we had this inquiry was to ask: are these issues important? We know there is a wide range of view and philosophical opinion on this, and I have to admit that through the process of this inquiry I have been confronted by more economic discussion and graphs than I care to enjoy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a duelling system of economic position on the area, but the one thing I think came out of it more than anything else was the fact that people care. People care about this issue. It has been given a good push along, and now Christine Lagarde has made comment on the issue and put it into the agenda to say that economies where there are clear distribution issues and income inequality are not as strong or effective as others. That has thrown a challenge to the economies of the world. What we have now is clear analysis of the status of income inequality across the OECD nations. This has led to an outpouring of graphs which show ratings as to where the Australian economy fits across other nations. Depending on which graph you look at, there are different processes of where we fit. Indeed, the core argument that came out and which I think will continue to be discussed in this place was that which Senator Seselja pointed out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is called the boats analogy. If the tide rises, it means that all the boats go up. The issue is that we are all better off than we were in the past. There is no argument about that. No matter which graph you look at, you see that people across Australian society have more wealth than they had in the past. But there are arguments against that, and I have to admit one that attracts me, though I am always fascinated by Senator Seselja's obsession with the left and right in this argument—I do not identify; it is not as clear as that—is that, yes, all the boats go up, but there are some boats that go up to a much higher level and leave other boats behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue that has attracted me in this discussion is the issue of mobility. If people are entrenched in an element of poverty, what are their opportunities and options for the future? We have heard other speakers talk very strongly about issues around education, health and disadvantage. The argument that we heard consistently through our inquiry was that, if you are entrenched in the lower percentiles—which comes into the argument all the time—you will have less opportunity. Your health, your education and your career and work opportunities will all be impacted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, we have seen that in a range of literature over the past years. I remember the Catholic social justice organisation put out documentation, which they are now updating, that looked at the postcode raffle in Australia. There are certain communities in Australia, because of the elements of disadvantage, who are concentrated in the lower level whose health and wellbeing are consistently going backwards. So all the boats might be rising but people in the lower groups, who are at the far end of the income scale, are seriously disadvantaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Several chapters of this report put forward the argument that, even though we have a stronger economy, one of the most well targeted welfare systems in the world—and every argument points to that reality—and an effective tax system that redistributes wealth and all the actions that economies are taking to make their wealth more equitable, the people entrenched in poverty, those people who are reliant on social welfare, are still severely disadvantaged. That is a direct result of aspects of income inequality in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not talk any longer today. I can feel some tension in the air that people want to move on. We will have more opportunities to speak on this issue—I will be moving to continue my remarks later. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we can do as a nation was part of the challenge of this committee. It was a challenge to us to keep the discussion going, to listen to the community. I think this is a step. We have a number of recommendations. Part of our recommendations is that we continue to analyse what is happening in our community, identify the issues, listen to the arguments and maintain a watch on this space. We think our government has the responsibility to keep a watch on the issue of income inequality in our community. We think that should be part of the standard operation of government. When we are putting forward budgets—and a lot of this committee looked at the impact of the last budget—we need to ensure that income inequality is one of the lenses that are put over what changes we are proposing to make. That should be part of the information that is shared freely. We think that should happen on a regular basis. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JOHNSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  by leave—I speak today to update the parliament and the Australian people about Australia's missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since my last statement in December 2013 there have been significant developments in Australia's mission in Afghanistan and this year has seen the commencement of the ADF mission in Iraq. There have been significant developments in Australia's mission in Afghanistan, including the completion of our mission in Uruzgan province and the historic transition of power to the national unity government of President Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I most recently visited Afghanistan in September of this year. My visit gave me the opportunity to see the progress being made. I also saw firsthand the work being carried out by our military and civilian personnel to support Afghanistan to ensure that its security, freedom and economy continue to develop. I met with senior Australian, ISAF and Afghan commanders and had an opportunity to address Australian troops serving in national and coalition appointments in Kabul.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After 13 years the largest military coalition in recent history, the ISAF mission, will conclude at the end of 2014 as planned. Our Afghan partner, the Afghan National Security Force, has grown in confidence and capability and is now in the lead for combat operations throughout Afghanistan. Challenges remain, but the ANSF continues to demonstrate its ability to plan and conduct independent and combined operations to protect the Afghan people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Australia lost another soldier this year, Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey, in a non-combat related incident in Afghanistan. Our mission in Afghanistan has come at a heavy cost, with the loss of 41 Australian Defence Force personnel and another 261 wounded. Our thoughts are with Lance Corporal Chidgey's family. They are not alone in their sorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the ISAF chapter closes, I think the ADF can look back with honour and pride in what it has achieved in Afghanistan. I am confident that we will continue with the same professionalism and dedication post-2014. It remains the Australian government's strong view that it is in Australia's interest to remain engaged in Afghanistan as part of this overall effort. Australia is committed to supporting security and stability in Afghanistan beyond 2014 through cooperation in security, diplomatic and development channels, and continuing to build the capacity of Afghanistan's national institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, our aid program will continue to build on and protect the gains of the last decade, supporting economic growth and governance, the empowerment of Afghan women and girls in particular, and at-risk populations. This has been quite remarkable. Australia has pledged to contribute to the post-2014 NATO-led train, advise and assist mission and our current contributions provide a good foundation for Australia's post-2014 commitment to Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The end of 2014 will also mark the conclusion of Operation Slipper, Australia's military contribution to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan and the International Coalition Against Terrorism mission across Afghanistan and the Middle East which commenced in October 2001. Since Australia commenced operations in the region, more than 33,000 Australian Defence Force personnel, Australian government civilians and Australian Federal Police have deployed to the Middle East area of operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 March 2014, Prime Minister Abbott announced that Australia will have an Anzac Day style national commemoration for the war in Afghanistan to ensure that the bitter experience of returning Vietnam veterans is not repeated for those who have served in Australia's longest war. It is important for the Australian people to have the opportunity during a nationwide commemoration activity to say thank you to the men and women who have served in the Middle East region. This activity will be held in each state and territory capital city and Townsville on Saturday, 21 March 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national commemoration for the completion of Operation Slipper will recognise the commitment and sacrifice of all Australian personnel who have deployed as part of Australia's commitment to combat terrorism across Afghanistan and the Middle East. Operation Slipper has involved civilian and military members from the Department of Defence, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other government agencies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to update the parliament on the commencement of the ADF mission in Iraq, to assist the Iraqi government and the people of Iraq to combat the major threat posed by the brutal actions of ISIL, also known as Daesh. This is not a decision the government has taken lightly. Ultimately it is Iraq that must defeat ISIL, but it cannot be left to confront this horrendous movement alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is reluctant to reach out to conflicts thousands of miles away, but this conflict has reached out to us. At least 70 Australians are fighting with ISIL and other terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, and another 100 or so supporting these extremists from inside Australia. This situation is as much a matter of domestic security as it is of international security. This trade is contribution is part of a broader coalition of over 60 nations that are operating in close collaboration with Iraq. This action has the support of regional nations across the Middle East and the wider international community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's decision has the support of the Prime Minister of Iraq, Dr Haider Al-Abadi, and responds to a formal request from the US Government to contribute specific ADF capabilities to the international coalition. Australia's contribution to the broad international coalition in Iraq includes: up to eight FA18 Super Hornet combat aircraft; one E7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft; one KC130A tanker and transport air-to-air refuelling aircraft; up to 400 personnel required to operate and sustain these capabilities; and a Special Operations Task Group of approximately 200 personnel to act as military advisers to the Iraqi Security Forces. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my September visit to the Middle East, I was lucky enough to meet many talented and dedicated members of the deployed Australian Air Task Group and Special Operations Task Group and was impressed by the extreme skill and professionalism of these Australian Defence Force personnel. I was pleased to learn that 51 women have been deployed as part of our Air Task Group in a range of operational and support areas, including as watch keepers, air operations coordinators, intelligence analysts and legal and public affairs officers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 24 November 2014, our FA18 Super Hornets had flown 64 missions in Iraq, each with two aircraft. The KC30A aircraft had flown 51 missions in Iraq, providing air-to-air refuelling support for Australian planes and other coalition aircraft. The E7A Wedgetail aircraft had flown 35 missions in Iraq, providing command and control and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support to coalition forces. On several occasions, Royal Australian Air Force personnel have taken the lead in planning and coordinating multinational air operations against ISIL targets in Iraq and achieved considerable success. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks an Australian FA18 Super Hornet identified a large, well-establish and hidden network of caves and bunkers occupied by ISIL in northern Iraq. Within days a subsequent multinational airstrike involving 20 aircraft attacked 44 targets, complimented by a large-scale ground operation led by the Kurdish Security Forces, and as such helped to clear this area of ISIL militants, with some reports indicating that over 100 Daesh fighters were killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition air operations are providing vital support to the Iraqi Security Forces' military campaign on the ground. This support has helped the Iraqi forces reclaim territory and key elements of national infrastructure previously held by ISIL, including the Bayji oil refinery in the country's north and the Fallujah dam, which provides critical water supplies across almost the whole of central Iraq. Crucially, our operations are providing time and space for Prime Minister Abadi to build an inclusive government and to regenerate the Iraqi Security Forces. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ADF mission in Iraq began with a clear humanitarian focus, and the plight of innocent civilians in Iraq remains central to all of our operations there. The ADF has conducted six humanitarian airdrop missions in northern Iraq to date to ease the terrible humanitarian situation imposed by ISIL forces on Iraqi civilians in the regions of Mount Sinjar and Amirli. The ADF has also conducted five military store supply missions to date, including arms and ammunition, as part of multinational efforts to equip the Kurdistan regional government to roll back ISIL. These stores are being used by Kurdish Peshmerga forces, which are operating in close conjunction with the Iraqi government security forces. Australia's objective in providing this support is to work with the Iraqi government to ensure it is able to keep its people safe, maintain reasonable control over its territory, and combat ISIL, or Daesh. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia stands firm as a responsible international partner who responds swiftly and effective to global security challenges. Our commitment to the mission in Afghanistan and our steadfast support for the international efforts against ISIL in Iraq signify Australia's firm intentions to deny terrorists safe havens to plan and train for attacks against civilians. We are not in this alone. In both Afghanistan and Iraq, Australia is a leading member of multinational coalitions who are working in close partnership with the host nations to defeat our mutual enemies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to remember that both these missions involve risk to our ADF personnel. As they conduct these essential missions, our thoughts are with them, particularly at this time of the year. They are doing a simply wonderful job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">I speak today to update the Parliament and the Australian people about Australia's missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is appropriate that the Government provides regular reports and updates on Australia's major military operations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Today I will provide an update on the forthcoming completion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan and transition of full security responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I will also confirm Australia's continued commitment to Afghanistan beyond 2014 through our participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) 'train, advise and assist' mission, <span style="font-style:italic;">Resolute Support Mission</span>, and our financial support to the sustainment of the ANSF. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to Iraq, in June this year the then Government of Iraq sought international assistance to combat the threat of ISIL. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's response was swift and decisive. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We contributed immediately to provide humanitarian relief supplies to the people of northern Iraq, and helped transport urgently needed arms and equipment to the Kurdish Peshmerga fighting ISIL. At the request of the United States Government, and with the support of the Government of Iraq, we have since become a participant in coalition combat air operations and have deployed a Special Operations Task Group to advise and assist the Iraqi Security Forces. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the minister for providing this update to the Senate. He has been good to his word. I know that all senators have a keen interest in the welfare of our ADF personnel, especially those who are in harm's way. I would also like to reiterate Labor's support for our ADF personnel, including their deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. It is especially important to thank the men and women of the ADF who are deployed overseas for their contribution at this time of the year. Thousands of ADF personnel will not be home for Christmas. They and their families will be in our thoughts through what is no doubt a difficult time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later this month will see the end of Operation Slipper in Afghanistan. Since Australia's involvement in operations in the Middle East region started in 2001, with more than 33,000 Australians deployed as ADF personnel, police or government civilians, 41 of these Australians lost their lives during this period—the last, Lance Corporal Chidgey, died in June this year. A further 261 Australians were wounded. Our thoughts are, as always, with all defence personnel and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four Australian personnel who served in Afghanistan received the Victoria Cross. The Victoria Cross is awarded to persons who, in the presence of the enemy, display the most conspicuous gallantry, a daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty. Many more Australians were recognised for their service in other ways. The ADF can be proud of the role that they played in defeating the Taliban and in creating a stable and secure environment to allow the Afghan government to establish itself. In recent years the Australian contribution in Afghanistan shifted to improving the capability of the Afghan National Security Forces, with an eye to transition all security responsibility to Afghanistan. While there is still much work to do, Afghanistan has improved significantly in recent years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Iraq ADF personnel are doing a great job to support operations against ISIL. ISIL is a barbaric organisation. There are vulnerable people in Iraq who need our help. As is appropriate, Australia has provided a proportionate level of support to the coalition. Our Defence personnel are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. Australia is one of more than 60 countries that are supporting the unity government in Iraq in their fight against ISIL. This is vitally important to remember: it is the Iraqi government that will ultimately combat and degrade ISIL, but it is proper for Australia to support Iraq where we can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already our Super Hornets have flown more than 60 mission in Iraq and they are taking the fight up to ISIL in Northern Iraq. Our KC30A aircraft have flown more than 51 missions. Our other air assets, including the Wedgetail, the Hercules and the Globemaster, have also provided vital support. On the ground we have around 200 special forces. They are now in Baghdad undertaking an important role advising and assisting the Iraqi army in their fight against ISIL. I am pleased that Defence have confirmed that appropriate force protection measures are in place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely appropriate, and the government have behaved very responsibly in ensuring, we did not rush headlong to try to get our troops deployed in Iraq. It is very important that all of the necessary documentation was provided, and we fully support the government taking the very precautionary approach they took in ensuring the safety of our troops and their legal protections. It would be entirely inappropriate for anything else to have happened, and the government has our full support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the Senate is given the opportunity to debate and discuss important issues. Minister Smith, before Minister Johnston, very much believed that this was the way to go. I know the Greens have a different view at times, but I know they will welcome the opportunity today to speak on these issues. While we may disagree, it is important that all in this chamber have an opportunity to express their view, put their case, argue their position. Ministerial statements provide us with that opportunity. I want to again express my support for the ADF personnel deployed around the world and to wish them and their families a happy and safe Christmas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to take note of the response tabled by the minister, Senator Fifield, to the order for production of documents that I put to the Senate and that the Senate supported—an order to provide the final version of the report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Evaluating New Income Management in the Northern Territory</span>. I am aware that the department had had a draft report prior to this final version. The order is for the final report which, as I understand it, was submitted to the government at the end of September. The response to the order to produce this document is: 'The government is not in a position to release the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evaluating New Income Management in the Northern Territory: Final Report</span> at this stage because the minister is yet to receive it. I do understand that the Department of Social Services received the report, and that they are presently preparing advice to the government on its content. The minister expects to receive the final report soon and has every intention of releasing it publicly.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report has been with the government for two months now. As a final report, they knew what was in it. This income management is what the government proposes to extend if they support the Forrest report recommendation for a healthy welfare card. From reports in the media, the Forrest review is critical of income management. It says it has not done what it was set up to do. Now the government appears to be supporting, or at least giving serious consideration to, the idea of a healthy welfare card—which, as I have said in this place before, is income management on steroids—and extending it to everybody. Yet the report on income management—the biggest experiment in the world, I suspect, that has been carried out on this form of income management and that has been going on for seven years—shows, if the media reports I have seen today are correct, that it has failed. The government is considering it, yet they have not bothered to give priority to consideration of the report. They have had it for two months and have not bothered to give it to the minister or to get the minister to consider it, yet they are busily considering the healthy welfare card. That is nonsense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final report should be publicly available so that everybody can see what a farce income management is and so that the public and the community can consider this report when they are looking at the concept of the healthy welfare card. Methinks that the government does not want to release a report that shows that income management has not worked—at least not while they are considering expanding it and giving it a boost across the rest of the country.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACT Government Loan Bill underpins the Government's decision to provide a concessional loan to the ACT Government of up to $1 billion to undertake a loose-fill asbestos remediation programme. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without the Commonwealth's assistance, the ACT's capacity to deal with this issue would have been significantly curtailed and put at threat its own credit rating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The loan will ensure that the ACT Government is in a position to deliver a well-structured remediation programme in the coming years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides authority for the Commonwealth to enter into a loan agreement with the ACT for an amount that must not exceed $1 billion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also appropriates $750 million from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 2014-15 for the purposes of making payments under the loan agreement.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill seeks to improve the operation and clarity of legislative frameworks for Commonwealth Acts and instruments. It is an important deregulatory measure that will create administrative efficiencies across government, while enhancing the public accessibility of Commonwealth laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The key purpose of the Bill is to reform the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Legislative Instruments Act came into force in 2005 and provides a comprehensive regime for the registration, tabling, scrutiny and sunsetting (or automatic repeal) of Commonwealth legislative instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It ensures that members of the public, businesses, regulatory agencies, lawyers and courts can easily access complete and authoritative legislative instruments and their explanatory statements on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. This is an important mechanism for ensuring access to justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2008, a statutory review of the Legislative Instruments Act was conducted by a committee comprising two senior members of the Commonwealth public service and the then Commonwealth Ombudsman. The committee consulted a broad range of stakeholders, with the release of an issues paper and over 60 responses to that paper. The committee also held extensive meetings with interested stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The review found that the Legislative Instruments Act had been largely successful in improving public access and facilitating parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments. It also found that a number of improvements could be made to the scheme and released a number of recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following the review, measures have been implemented to strengthen the legislative instruments framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has been a significant amount of work to manage the sunsetting of legislative instruments across the Commonwealth. This has included the Government's efforts over both Repeal Days this year to repeal over 10,000 spent and redundant legislative instruments from the statute books.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sunsetting of older legislative instruments also presents a unique opportunity for the Government to reduce red tape, deliver clearer and simpler laws, and align existing legislation with current government policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Technical enhancements have been made to the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments to ensure a high level of performance and useability, and to support the sunsetting of legislative instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel have issued new guidance materials to help Commonwealth rule-makers and agencies to manage their legislative instruments efficiently, effectively and in accordance with the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But there is still more work to do to enhance access to instruments and to improve the efficiency and operation of the scheme.  Some of this work follows the recommendations of the review, and some of it comes from the experience gained by the passage of time with the scheme now in place for almost 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill seeks to simplify and consolidate legislative frameworks for the publication of Commonwealth Acts and the registration of Commonwealth instruments, into a single Act.  The Bill will implement this change by renaming the Legislative Instruments Act the Legislation Act 2003 and repealing the Acts Publication Act 1905.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current database of Commonwealth Acts and the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, which are both accessed through ComLaw, will be integrated into a single Register called the Federal Register of Legislation.  Importantly, this Register will provide users with the ability to access other documents and information relevant to Commonwealth laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are other types of instruments made by the Commonwealth that are not made as legislative instruments as they are not legislative in character.  These instruments do not currently need to be published on the Federal Register. Historically, many of these instruments were published in paper form only.  Over time, there have been efforts to ensure that instruments are published electronically and able to be accessed by users online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The problem is that instruments are published in many different places, including in various government gazettes, on agency websites or portals or in newspapers. This makes it difficult for users to find these instruments or to even be aware they exist. It also places a burden on agencies to manage their stock of instruments and ensure they have adequate infrastructure in place to support the publication of these instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill helps to address this problem. It expands the scope of the legislative instruments framework to cover a new category of instruments, called notifiable instruments. This means that instruments which are not legislative in character can also be registered on the centrally managed and authoritative Federal Register of Legislation, which will allow them to be more readily publicised and accessed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments will align the processes for registration, compilations and authorised versions for Acts and a broader range of instruments. The amendments will also enable the First Parliamentary Counsel to make minor editorial changes in preparing registered compilations of Acts and instruments that do not change the effect of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments will produce administrative efficiencies across government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with the Government's deregulation agenda and efforts to promote clearer and simpler laws, the Bill will enable bulk amendments or repeals arising from the thematic review of instruments to be made more quickly and simply. In consultation with the relevant rule makers, the Attorney General will be able to advise the Governor-General to make a single instrument that would give effect to such a review across government portfolios.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will help clarify and better define legislative instruments and legislative character to ensure that instruments are made in their appropriate form and able to be enforceable by registration as legislative instruments on the Register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will move certain content from the Act to regulations to help consolidate detail that may be more suitably placed in delegated legislation and which may need to be updated regularly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will also allow the First Parliamentary Counsel to make rules about matters for the purpose of meeting his or her obligation to maintain a consistent, accurate and up to date Register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This mechanism will facilitate a level of procedural detail that may not be appropriate for including in the Act or the regulations. The rules will be a legislative instrument, which means they will be subject to parliamentary oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also clarifies consultation requirements for the drafting of legislative instruments to ensure that the requirement of rule makers to undertake appropriate consultation applies equally to instruments that affect business and competition and those that do not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Bill will remove transitional mechanisms for dealing with instruments made before the Legislative Instruments scheme was introduced in 2005. It will amend numerous other Acts to make clear in enabling legislation that certain instruments are legislative or notifiable instruments for the purpose of the Legislation Act, and update references to repealed provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and the repealed Statutory Rules Publication Act 1905 to relevant provisions in the Legislation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consequently, the Bill repeals the Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003 which will become redundant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also amend other Acts to convert gazettal or other publication requirements into requirements to register an instrument on the Federal Register where this would be appropriate or would reflect current practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Certain provisions on the statute book that provide an implied power to make an instrument will be updated to expressly confer a power to make an instrument. This will not change the effect of those provisions but will remove any doubt about whether such provisions are effective in conferring power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will repeal section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides for non-legislative disallowable instruments, and makes consequential amendments to laws that provide for these instruments.  This will reduce the number of disallowance regimes for instruments, encourage a reduction in separate gazettal procedures, and enhance the status of the Federal Register as a central repository and authoritative source of Commonwealth legislative instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill will amend the Acts Interpretation Act to expand and simplify the provisions dealing with machinery of government changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments will broaden the rules for interpreting references to ministers and departments in legislation, and for interpreting references to authorities in agreements entered into by or on behalf of the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will provide more legal certainty for the ongoing valid exercise of powers and functions immediately following machinery of government changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will not alter the processes for the consideration of Bills and legislative instruments by Parliament. The measures in the Bill will not substantially alter the way in which Acts are handled under the existing publication regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill provides the opportunity for significant reforms to the legislative frameworks for Commonwealth Acts and instruments. It will create administrative efficiencies across the government, helping to reduce 'beige tape' which can cause large imposts on government agencies. It will also facilitate efforts to reduce red tape. Most importantly, this Bill will promote the principle of access to justice by enhancing the accessibility of Commonwealth laws.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act will clarify that appeals cannot be made from minor procedural decisions, such as decisions to change hearing dates. This will reduce delays in the court system to ensure more efficient administration of justice. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the amendments will clarify that police officers and court sheriffs can use reasonable force to enter premises to execute an arrest warrant for persons who are the subject of proceedings for contempt of court or for summary offences. This resolves current uncertainty about whether officers can use reasonable force. There have been occasions when an arrest warrant has not been executed due to this uncertainty.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At present, in most jurisdictions, the applicable law provides for Commonwealth tenancy disputes to be resolved in state or territory tribunals, which can lead to inconsistency of approach. While superior courts may also be able to hear these matters, it is not considered an appropriate use of these courts' resources as it may lengthen the dispute resolution process and increase costs. This means that there is currently no suitable or affordable forum to hear these disputes. Conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to hear these disputes provides a cost effective option and will provide a consistent forum available across Australia. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to cutting red tape costs by $1 billion a year to improve our nation's competitiveness, help to create more jobs and lower household costs.  This is a critical step towards improving Australia's productivity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'Red tape', which is an umbrella term for excessive and unnecessary regulation, reduces productivity and investment, stifles job creation, creates uncertainty and saps confidence.  Red tape prevents business from getting on with the job, and places heavy demands on the community's time and resources that could better be spent elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It goes without saying therefore that reducing red tape across the economy will create an enormous opportunity to increase Australia's productivity and competitiveness.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Deregulation—the process of eliminating red tape—needs a whole-of-government approach to tackling excessive or unnecessary regulations, no matter how big.  The goal is long-term cultural change, from the bureaucracy to the ministry, for the betterment of the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We want to see a paradigm shift in Australia's approach to regulation, whereby new standards, rules and compliance burdens are never used as the default option, but are only introduced as a last resort and only after alternatives have been assessed and the cost of new regulation fully understood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We also want a renewed focus on ensuring that existing regulation is as efficient as possible, and is only retained where the benefits clearly outweigh the costs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's deregulation efforts are therefore focused on a number of key areas including actively reducing the volume of regulation.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 June 2014 the Government announced administrative changes to the entry thresholds for the PAYG instalments system, reducing the number of taxpayers required to pay instalments.  The thresholds, which had not been reviewed since 2001-02, were changed as follows: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Taxation Office has estimated that this will remove more than 560,000 taxpayers from the pay-as-you-go instalments system and lead to annual savings of $67.3 million in compliance costs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 August 2014 the Government announced its chosen model for transforming the existing Australian Small Business Commissioner into a Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 21 August 2014 the Government implemented changes to the SuperStream regulations to remove the requirement for employers to use a unique 'payment reference number' when making superannuation contributions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Removing this provision allows employers and funds to retain existing payment processes and ensures balances are allocated to member accounts in a timely fashion.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current payslip reporting provisions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 </span>require employers to include in employee payslips information prescribed by the regulations.  Labor had intended that regulations be made so that employers had to report on payslips the amount of superannuation contributions and the date on which the employer expects to pay them.  Labor never made these regulations. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 to this Bill also repeals spent or redundant taxation laws, such as the older harsh penalty regimes, and moves longstanding regulations into the primary law.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  Labor oppose this rearrangement of business. We are concerned that this morning we were in the middle of a very serious debate on the migration legislation, which we were told was absolutely urgent. So there was a change from last evening where the important National Water Commission (Abolition) Bill 2014 was listed. We were in the middle of that debate last night and thought it would continue. Then we came in this morning and the government had decided that that was not so important and that we would go to the asylum seeker bill. We do not believe this is the way to run the chamber. For this very crucial time, less than an hour, which we have for government business this afternoon we believe we should follow the scheme we had this morning. We know that the government is just waiting to get the numbers on this bill but it seems we are waiting consistently to see where the changes will be. That is not appropriate. It does not lead to consistency in the way we operate. It also means that the speakers who were lined up to have their engagement in these bills are then thrown away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No urgency has been put forward by the government as to why we have to have this change. If the water commission bill was so urgent, we could have completed it this morning without a problem. We were told that the asylum bill needed to come on and it did. We are halfway through that one and this will just continue. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the opposition were given a list of priority bills which the government needs to have asked by the end of this session. We look forward to the hours motion tomorrow, which will reinforce what those priorities will be. For the change of businesses this afternoon, we do not think this is appropriate. We do not think that we are putting on a stunt either because it seems every time we move in opposition to the government it is seen as a stunt. We are putting forward the issue which we believe we started. We are in the middle of considering the asylum bill and we should retain that process on the Red for the rest of the day.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  The Greens do not support the National Water Commission (Abolition) Bill 2014. The National Water Commission is a most important organisation that we really do need to retain. It provides crucial oversight of our water policies. It is worth remembering that it operates with a very small team, doing important work. I understand that that team recently went from about 41 down to eight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission has provided government and industry with quality information needed to make good decisions about the effectiveness of our current water policies and directions for the future. What is being lost here is the integrated approach. The integrated approach is so important when it comes to water, and that is what the commission has provided for water policy in the 10 years of its existence. We really cannot afford to lose it. It is of grave concern to me that, given the current threats to our water supplies from climate change and the mining industry, in particular, and the ongoing struggles between water used for production and water used for the environment, we are looking at removing the only body that brings together oversight of our water policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that there are other bodies that provide important information in this area, such as the government's Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development. But the National Water Commission is the place where these groups actually come together to sort through these issues. The processes of the National Water Initiative and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan have been well shepherded by the commission. This work is still tenuous and needs ongoing support. Removing the National Water Commission sends the wrong message to those involved in these processes. It is of great concern to me, as the National Water Commission itself has pointed out, that the proposed reporting date for the first audit of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been moved to 2018 in this legislation. We have already had delays in the readiness of this plan, which is why the commission was able to offer only an interim report in 2013. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the crucial aspects of this legislation that underlines why this bill should not pass. We need oversight of the Murray-Darling Basin process from an independent body. That is what we have right now. And that is what we could lose. As many of the stakeholders in this debate have noted, the government cannot be marking its own homework. That was the message we heard time and again at the inquiry that was held into this legislation. Yet, under the government's plans, the marking does not even occur. The plan will be implemented before we are able to intervene. This is a very concerning aspect of this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation proposes to move the National Water Commission's reporting requirements on the National Water Initiative and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan over to the Productivity Commission. This is not satisfactory. It will really degrade this work. It is a concern to the Greens and should be a concern to all who care about the future of our water planning. You will hear many people here say that, but if they are sincere they will keep the National Water Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a number of submissions to the inquiry on this legislation have pointed out, the commission does not yet have the expertise needed to advise on these matters. The Productivity Commission's expertise is in economic matters, not those of the environment. That is set out when you look at the objects of how the Productivity Commission works. It is very clear. It is quite narrow—we are not disputing that—but it does not have the expertise and background to take on the important work of the NWC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission was never established with the management of environmental matters in mind. It came about in 1998 out of the combination of the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. Its legislation reflects these priorities very clearly. Part 2, section 6 of the act, 'Functions of commission' sets this out. It uses the phrase: 'industry, industry development and productivity', and it uses those terms five times. Nowhere is the environment mentioned. Not once. Protecting the environment is not a function of the Productivity Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2, section 8 of the act, the policy guidelines for the Productivity Commission, is about economic performance, reducing regulation, encouraging growth and economic adjustments, and other issues to do with the economy and industry. It is not until we get down to part 2, section 8(1)(i) that we see the term 'ecologically sustainable'. This still is only in the context of industry development. It is not set out in terms of an environmental judgement; the environment is not a key consideration of how this body undertakes its work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has multiple competing priorities in its reporting requirements. It is not able to sufficiently capture—and nor does this legislation allow it to—the breadth of work carried out by the National Water Commission. That is a key point. I know that the government has been lobbying hard to get support for taking the work of the National Water Commission over to the Productivity Commission, and making out that the Productivity Commission can cover the important endeavours and work undertaken by the NWC. But right now, with how the Productivity Commission is actually structured, that is not possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ongoing functions of the National Water Commission, in particular relating to stakeholder engagement on all water related issues, are nowhere to be found in this legislation. Imagine that! Stakeholder engagement is not found in this legislation; it is a key part of how the National Water Commission has operated and that is what we will lose if this bill goes through. Some minimal functions go to the Department of the Environment and others, but there is no central coordination of all these issues. That is another very worrying aspect; we need that central coordination and that is what we could lose. This I suggest is precisely what the government wants. There is an agenda here, pushed by the government, and this is part of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's approach is really quite fragmented. It removes the thorough leadership and the continuity offered by the commission. The government's plan to remove the National Water Commission is not leadership; it is not even the management we need when it comes to water policy across this country. Sustaining our water supply and protecting the environment should be our top priority. That is what we could lose if this bill goes through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hearings at the inquiry into this legislation have made it abundantly clear that contrary to government claims that the National Water Commission has done its job and that water is well covered by other government bodies, water reform at the state level is at risk of unravelling if we lose the National Water Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of New South Wales we have seen the consolidation of water bodies at the same time as water licenses are, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation, being handed out to farmers who have illegally diverted water. This is what we mean about 'unravelling'. Not only is there a lack of integration but some very dubious practices are being allowed to play out, and that threatens our water resources. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the abolition of Queensland's Water Commissioner that state is keeping up its reputation for really tearing apart anything to do with the environment by amending its water act to automatically grant licences to mine coal seam gas operations. That can be a direct threat to our water resources. Under no circumstances should it be allowed to happen automatically. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The picture is no better elsewhere. In Victoria, water protections are being weakened, and in Western Australia and the Northern Territory they are not compliant with the National Water Initiative. The National Water Commission itself has argued that water has fallen off the COAG agenda. This is actually not a surprise since it seems that the current policy of coalition governments at state and federal levels is a return to the laissez-faire days where we allow irresponsible use of water resources until there is another emergency. Governments may get away with letting anything happen to water resources and not have the plans and limits in place, but there will be another that drought. There will be another extreme weather event associated with climate change. There will be another weather emergency that we need to respond to and that is why we need to retain the National Water Commission—so we are well placed for that response, we are ready for it and we can take the measures to limit the impact of those very damaging extreme weather events</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucial areas of water policy that were highlighted by the inquiry into this legislation but were not covered at all by this legislation demonstrate the need for real leadership on water policy. When you get rid of the National Water Commission, you are basically getting rid of leadership in this area. The commission's job to identify areas in need of reform and begin those discussions is the gap that will be left by the commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those crucial areas is Indigenous water rights. Working on Indigenous water rights with the First People's Water Engagement Council, the commission earned itself a most important and well-earned reputation for its consultative approach to these issues. This process involved extensive engagement culminating in a First People's National Water Summit, which gave advice to the commission in May 2012. It was outstanding and I would say it was historic—and, again, it underlines how much we stand to lose if this bill goes through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The initiative has already wound back the Indigenous Water Advisory Committee formed by the Department of the Environment in June this year. This is a pattern we are seeing with this government. This legislation has not gone through yet but there has been so many steps that this government has taken, so many actions to actually gut the National Water Commission before the legislation gets here. I think it is a very immoral and undemocratic way that they operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of these organisations is a sad indictment on the way governments too often operate in their interactions with Indigenous people. For the first time, the Aboriginal community had been engaged on these issues. Such much would have been achieved at the meetings and roundtables of these organisations. There had been talk of even adding an Indigenous Commissioner to the National Water Commission. How impressive is that? Progress was being made but what we have seen is a government that makes out it has a commitment to Indigenous issues. It will even make out it has a commitment to decent water policies but, in that quite simple but very negative damaging act, it has set back the rights of Indigenous people with regard to water in this country. The closure of the National Water Commission will be the final step in undoing these important processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen initiatives from the commission highlighting the potential impact of coal seam gas on our water supplies. Across the nation, I am sure many of us have witnessed in the last three or four years in particular an explosion of local communities coming together opposing coal seam gas and mining projects. Often they are farmers whose livelihood depends on the safety and health of their water. Whenever I visit these communities, the issue that is raised is: how do we protect our water now and into the future? The National Water Commission raised this issue in 2010 and continued to voice concerns that this is an area which needs more work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Staying in New South Wales and looking to our northwest, there is an ongoing drought there. This is a real reminder that what will happen in this country is there will be another drought. There will be massive droughts and droughts located in certain areas. We need to be prepared. We have much more knowledge these days. But we need the National Water Commission to provide that integrated leadership. We may have recovered from the millennium drought, and we may have negotiated—and I emphasise 'negotiated'—a plan to recover the Murray-Darling, but the work of water reform is far from over. The negotiations are not really finished despite what we are hearing from the minister. I would have hoped that we would learn from this process. It is very expensive to retrospectively fix a problem with water and sometimes it is not possible. And I would point out to Minister Joyce, who seems to think that if we just build massive dams everywhere we will be fine, you have to have the water to start with. Dams do not create water, as the minister seems to allude to in some of his ridiculous statements. Not only do we need to preserve our water but we need to ensure we do it in a way that is clean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to make sure we will not be diverting water from places where it is desperately needed—and that is another great failing of Minister Joyce's approach to water conservation in this country. It is a not only a grave mistake to destroy our only body, the National Water Commission, that is independent and has the relevant expertise to guide our governments on water policy but it is really utterly irresponsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was pointed out to the committee investigating this legislation, keeping the National Water Commission would push the government's budget out by one-ten thousandth of a percent. This is not a budget measure in this case. We often can identify what is a budget measure—obviously the higher education bill this week has been a standout. This bill, however, is not a budget measure. You really feel it is ideologically driven because the government wants to strip down the quite simple but not extensive leadership and at times control the National Water Commission has in this area because it wants to be able to favour its big constituents—those who need big water operations for their activities in rural Australia. Again, that is very short-term thinking, even short-term thinking for those who will benefit in the short run. Because right now we need to be doing everything to bring our water policy to a point where it is responsible, not just for certain users but for the whole nation, not just for this generation but for future generations and not just for those of us in the city but for those of us across the whole country. And environmental protection needs to be a part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was pointed out to the committee investigating this legislation, keeping the National Water Commission would push the government budget, as I said, out by just a fraction. That is a bargain. I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote against abolishing the National Water Commission and to support the reinstatement of funding that is about to go to the Productivity Commission if this bill is passed. The National Water Commission still has its leadership in place. All its fine work is still there: the need to address issues across the nation—integration between the states and to take forward the National Water Initiative—is work that remains to be done. This bill should not pass.</span>

In 2004, the Howard government established the National Water Commission, or NWC, as part of the National Water Initiative—the national plan for sustainable water use in Australia—to ensure that communities and industry have a reliable water supply, while protecting the health of our water systems. It was set up in recognition of the need for national water leadership to help address serious challenges. These included drought and climate change, water's role in securing Australia's economic and environmental future, the value of water for recreation and tourism, the need to advance the sustainable use of water and the impacts of fast-growing cities on water availability and delivery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor contends that these issues are just as important today as they were in 2004. We believe this bill will create a huge gap in the area of national water oversight and will threaten ongoing water reform for very little gain. I was the deputy chair of the inquiry into this bill through the Environment and Communications Committee. The inquiry received 32 submissions from a range of stakeholders, experts, government bodies and interested individuals. Many submissions pointed out Australia's excellent international reputation for taking early, decisive action in the area of water reform. This was particularly evident in the case of the millennium drought, which resulted in large portions of the country being drought declared and which saw the federal government provide $4.5 billion in assistance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is little doubt that the National Water Commission played an important role in this proud history, and to abolish it now would be short-sighted to say the least. Not one sector of our economy could survive if we did not have secure, safe and strategically managed water supplies. Our economic, environmental and personal health and, indeed, the stability of our society, relies on the security and strategic allocation of water resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been said that water is either an A-level issue or a Z-level issue. That is to say that in times of drought, or when concerns about scarcity or pollution arise, water quickly shoots to the top of the political and media agendas. However, a little while after the crisis passes, complacency can set in and water can slip off the policy radar. Attention wanes and resources are allocated to other issues. But we need to recognise that it is the solid, ongoing reform work that is done during 'Z' times that ensures that 'A' times do not hit or, if they do, that we are better equipped to respond to them. To cut funding to vital water reform institutions just because we have had a few good years of rain is short-sighted to say the least. If we do not maintain resources now, we will force a hastily-invoked crisis response when water challenges inevitably arise in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submitters to the inquiry told the committee how crucial the NWC has been to the progress that has been made so far on the National Water Initiative. Again and again, the committee heard concerns for the future of this important reform if the NWC is lost. In fact, it was hard to find any criticism of the NWC in the submissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are just a few comments to give you an idea of the regard held for the commission and the critical role it has played in our water management arrangements. Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science, Prof. Richard Kingsford said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Water Initiative has provided critical support for national decision-making on issues related to water management.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has been substantial technical innovation and reform by industry and state governments in meeting urban water needs across Australia in recent years, in large part driven by the challenges of changing climate conditions and drought. We believe that these initiatives were greatly assisted by the national focus that resulted from the establishment of the National Water Commission (NWC) in 2004 and the development of the National Water Initiative (NWI).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These words all echo the findings of the independent COAG review into the NWC, which was undertaken in 2011. The report of the review recognises the importance of the NWC in Australia's strategic water reform arrangements when it says:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having a single entity responsible for monitoring, audit and assessment, and knowledge leadership therefore enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of each of the individual activities. This will become even more important in the future as reforms become more difficult.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Which begs the question: if the vast majority of stakeholders rate the work of the commission so highly, then why is the government persisting with its abolition?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main argument used by the government to justify the actions of the National Water Commission is that it will save money. However, as the Australian Conservation Foundation pointed out in their submission to the inquiry 'the potential savings represent less than 0.0001 per cent of our annual budget'. Surely the care and management of our most precious national resource is worth that much. We also need to look at what we stand to lose with the savings touted by those opposite. On this matter Stormwater Queensland said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We believe the economic costs of abolishing the [National Water Commission], in terms of inefficient water management, are likely to far outweigh that cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has said the key functions of the National Water Commission will be carried over to other bodies including ABARES, the Productivity Commission and the Department of the Environment. However, submitters to the inquiry contradict this view. The submissions from the Australian Water Association and the Water Services Association pointed out that the bill transfers only two statutory functions to the Productivity Commission. Similarly, the Australian Conservation Foundation raised concerns in their submission that a number of legislative policy advice functions have not been transferred in the new arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another factor to consider is resourcing. We know that the National Water Commission had 41 staff before the budget, but questioning during the hearing revealed that only 12 or 13 of these staff will transfer to the department. Surely, the government cannot really expect us to believe resources can be cut by two-thirds with no loss of output, stringency or depth. We will need to remember that this situation can only be exacerbated by the broad staff cuts that are currently being inflicted on the Public Service. The reality is that the government's argument about cost savings does not stack up. The committee has been told that in fact the opposite is true. We simply cannot afford to drop the ball on water reform now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another argument the government has used in its attempt to axe the NWC is that, in the words of Senator Birmingham, 'much of the commission's reform work has already been done'. However, Senator Birmingham's statement is contradicted by the vast majority of expert advice. In fact, the COAG review I mentioned earlier also had a bit to say about the state of water reform in Australia when it said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NWI remains a relevant and active reform agenda supported by most stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It added:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The elements of the NWI still to be implemented are, by their nature, the more difficult ones and the role that can be played by a specialist and independent body like the NWC is likely to be … more important in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submitters to the inquiry also concurred with this perspective. On this issue, the Australian Conservation Foundation said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">National water reform, as envisaged under the National Water Initiative is a long term journey. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go, particularly within the context of changes to the use of water resources in northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions from the Australian Water Association, the Water Services Association of Australia and Konfluence noted that the reasons that the Howard government established the NWC are just as relevant today as they were 10 years ago. They also pointed out that a number of new challenges have arisen to make the task even more complex. These include the role of water management in energy production, generation and use of energy in water management, the potential alignment of water, energy and waste services at a retail level, the special issue of water management in northern Australia and balancing the creation of long-lived assets such as desalination plants against short-term affordability issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All three submissions also acknowledged the very contemporary issue of water management in the resources sector, especially coal seam gas. And all three submissions echoed the concerns of many when they said that meeting these challenges will be harder 'without national leadership' and could result in 'inferior outcomes for customers, industry and the environment'. The Australian Water Association also saw the need for specific reforms in the areas of water pricing, trading and infrastructure as well as long-term sustainability in urban and rural water use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists was also very specific in its analysis of the work still to be done and provided the inquiry with a long list of areas where reform is still needed. These included the treatment of extreme events in water plans, improvement and expansion of water markets, integrated management of surface and groundwater, identification of over-allocated systems, environmental watering monitoring, urban and rural water pricing and the impacts of water planning decisions for Indigenous communities. So we can see that there is a clear conflict between the government's claims that reform work is largely complete and the expert testimony that the water reform journey has just begun. Unlike this government, Labor is willing to listen to the experts. And unlike this government, we are not willing to compromise Australia's ability to respond to the ongoing challenges of water reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another concern shared by many of the submitters to the inquiry was that the abolition of the NWC would see a loss of independent oversight of Australia's water arrangements and the National Water Initiative. Submitters recognised the value of an independent body that can provide frank and fearless advice to governments and maintain a long-term perspective that transcends election cycles. On this issue, Environment Centre NT submitted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Independent Federal oversight of the NWI is required to ensure water resources are far less likely to become depleted, that resource allocation decisions are made under a fair, transparent and informed process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, research conducted and funded by the NWC has also been critical to building well-informed decision-making processes around water resource allocation and management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many submitters took particular note of the important role the NWC has played in overseeing the actions of the states, which are largely responsible for implementing actions within the National Water Initiative. On this matter, University of New South Wales's Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science, Professor Richard Kingsford, raised concerns about the potential for 'a loss of engagement and accountability of the states and what they are doing'. He went on to say, 'That is my biggest concern about the National Water Initiative'. Interestingly, it was not that long ago that those opposite seemed to agree. In fact, in 2012 Senator Simon Birmingham said the National Water Commission's:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the Abbott government is no longer concerned about ensuring accountability, but Labor are, and this is yet another reason we will be opposing this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another big concern the committee heard with the abolition of the NWC is the enormous amount of knowledge and expertise that we stand to lose. Currently, the National Water Commission Act specifies the areas of high level expertise required by commissioners for appointment, including water resource management; freshwater ecology or hydrology; resource economics; public sector governance; and the audit, evaluation or implementation of programs relating to natural resource management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Farmers Federation called for this expertise requirement to be maintained in the transfer of National Water Commission functions to the Productivity Commission. Sadly, if this bill proceeds, this will not happen and Australia will lose this incredible bank of knowledge and experience. Under questioning, the Productivity Commission conceded that this expertise does not exist within the organisation and would have to be hired in on a needs basis. This is very different from having ongoing in-house expertise that can inform every element of water reform, and Labor does not believe that it is sufficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are concerned that if the bill proceeds, Australia will lose this expertise and with it the ability to make the best decisions based on the latest scientific information. As part of this bill, responsibility for assessing progress on the National Water Initiative and for auditing of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan as well as monitoring water markets and payments to Basin states would transfer to the Productivity Commission. While no-one would suggest that the Productivity Commission is not an excellent and laudable institution, the inquiry heard many concerns that the NWC role in stakeholder engagement and consultation would be lost if the bill proceeds. Many submitters lauded the success of the NWC's coordination and consultative processes, which have been performed through its stakeholder reference group. And many voiced concerns that the Productivity Commission is not equipped to take on this type of ongoing consultation and engagement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard, the National Farmers Federation recommended that the Productivity Commission institute a stakeholder reference panel, but, unfortunately, this option is not on the table. Labor is persuaded by the arguments of the NFF and other submitters that the NWC's consultative role is vital and that it will not adequately be supported in the new arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another commonly voiced concern with the transfer of functions to the Productivity Commission is that of focus. Many were worried that the Productivity Commission's prime focus on economic factors would see the vitally important social and environmental factors reduced to a lower priority. The National Farmers Federation were particularly concerned about this and recommended in their submission that the Productivity Commission should be required to adopt a triple bottom-line approach to their proposed water functions. Realistically, however, this change will not be made with this bill, and if it is passed the concerns of the NFF will still stand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the only submitters that fully supported the government's proposed abolition of the NWC and associated arrangements was the National Irrigators Council. Unfortunately, many of the concerns raised by this council in its submission actually will not be addressed by this bill. Issues raised are unlikely to be affected at all by the abolition of the National Water Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor stand in unity with the vast majority of submitters to the inquiry into this bill that a national, coordinated approach to water reform is needed to deliver on the National Water Initiative. We believe that the National Water Commission provides valuable, frank and independent advice to governments of all persuasions across jurisdictions. We believe that the NWC's level of expertise and role in bringing stakeholders together cannot be lost. We believe the NWC has a proven track record for promoting the need for and benefits of ongoing water reform, and ensuring plans are made to secure Australia's economic future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe this plan threatens the stability, coherence and accountability of Australia's water reform and puts it at serious risk of falling off the agenda entirely. We do not believe that the very small annual saving goes anywhere near compensating the losses that this bill will create in terms of expertise and the fulfilment of other functions. We also believe that for such a small saving, we simply cannot risk the possibility that we will drop the ball on water reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, this amount of money is negligible when compared to the future of water in this country. And, clearly, when this government is willing to spend billions of dollars to pay millionaires to have babies, we can see some seriously twisted priorities at play. As in so many areas, the statements of this government are at a variance with the experts who deal with this issue every day of their professional lives. Again, this government is ignoring the advice of scientists and experts in— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President of the Senate and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise to congratulate Daniel Andrews, the hardworking frontbench and all the members of the Victorian Labor Party. Four years of hard work has paid off with the election of the Andrews government. One of the first acts of the Andrews government will be to resolve the long-running and unnecessary dispute with our paramedics, and to recall parliament to introduce the back to work act, helping to create 100,000 new jobs for retrenched workers and unemployed youth. Daniel Andrews and his new frontbench have a strong mandate to fix the problems in Victoria. They have a set of policies that were very popular in the community: fixing the worst 50 rail crossings, building the Metro Rail tunnel, fixing TAFE and making Victoria the education state to name but a few. I look forward to see these and other initiatives commenced or implemented over the next four years. There is little doubt in my mind that the Andrews government will be a hardworking and very competent government. Critically, they will need to address some key issues that have been left unresolved by the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the body responsible for the oversight of the Victorian police force, the Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission, or IBAC, asked the government for additional powers and resources so it could properly do its job. The legislation proposed by the previous government as a means to grant more powers to IBAC failed to make it to parliament before the election. This issue needs to be addressed by the Andrews government. IBAC is waiting for a response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made a number of speeches in this chamber about the problems in the Victorian police force. In Victoria, we have a police force that undertakes its own internal investigations of complaints made against its own police. Time and time again, internal investigations of police by police have exonerated the actions of police, even in cases where the courts have found serious wrongdoing. We have a significant number of complaints about police, particularly in the case of police assaults. I believe we have a systemic problem in the Victorian police force. This is as a result of many police believing that they can act with impunity, and it appears that, in the vast majority of cases, they are right. The worst that will generally happen to them is some internal disciplinary charges. They can rely on their fellow officers to back up their version of events or indeed, as we know, concoct a completely new version of events to suit the circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On handing down a recent decision against police who had concocted a story to cover up an assault, Magistrate Charlie Rozencwajg said Victoria Police appeared to suffer from a similar culture of silence to that of the criminal world. He went on to say that, in the criminal underworld, informing on a colleague was known as being a 'dog'. 'A similar culture, for whatever reason, existed in the Victorian police force.' I want to work with the new Andrews government to ensure that, in Victoria, we have a truly independent body to investigate complaints made against police and, importantly, to instigate charges against police for their misconduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have no action taken against the police who assaulted Corinna Horvath close to 20 years ago. The Magistrates' Court found that the police assaulted Corinna. The United Nations Human Rights Committee found that the state of Victoria failed to provide proper redress for Corinna. And yet we have seen little more than an apology and an ex gratia payment. Three of the four police officers who assaulted Corinna still work in the Victorian police force. Police officers involved should face the criminal charges identified by the County Court's Judge Williams back in 2001, where he found police at fault of assault, unlawful arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, and found that the police told lies on matters of major significance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bodies responsible for police oversight in Victoria—IBAC and the Office of Police Integrity, or the OPI—have proved to be completely ineffectual in that role. The OPI dedicated two pages of its 2010-11 annual report to a police raid on a small bungalow in Williamstown, where three teenagers—all minors—were assaulted, pepper sprayed and arrested. The OPI conducted an independent review and found that the police used excessive force, and then referred the incident back to Victoria Police for action. After conducting their own internal review, the police found that many of the OPI's findings were not valid and took no action against the police involved. The body responsible for police oversight was just completely ignored by the Victorian police force command.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One possible solution to this systemic crisis is already in operation internationally. The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland's office provides the public with an independent and impartial investigation of complaints made against police. Northern Ireland's police ombudsman has the power to refer charges to the Public Prosecution Service and seek disciplinary action against police. The office has a complement of around 150 people—about two-thirds of whom are employed within the office's investigative teams. In its 2011-12 annual report, the Northern Ireland's police ombudsman stated that it had received 3,336 new complaints against police that year. Nine hundred and eight recommendations were made to the Public Prosecution Service, including nine criminal charges against police. Four hundred and ninety-three recommendations were made to the police force command, including 19 cases where they recommended formal disciplinary proceedings. In comparison, IBAC received 2,567 complaints regarding police misconduct, which covered over 4,860 allegations in the 2013-14 year alone. In that year, IBAC conducted only 24 investigations. This is clearly inadequate by anyone's standard.</span>

Those officers who conduct assaults against citizens of Victoria must be held accountable as if they were any other citizen for those breaches of the law. Victorians expect this. This is happening in many overseas jurisdictions. We must have an independent body that investigates police. We cannot have police investigating police. We know that that does not work. Case after case has demonstrated that that does not work. We need a truly independent body to conduct those investigations and have the ability to have charges laid against police for their misconduct.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  We are now into the first week of December, and this is our final scheduled parliamentary sitting week for 2014. If you look around the building, you will see Christmas trees and lights decorating some offices, and no doubt there are Christmas functions happening in the building even as I speak. Christmas is traditionally a time of goodwill and for many a time to relax. For some—most particularly young Australians—it is a time of year that takes on magical properties; sometimes miracles even seem possible. Of course, as we grow older the Christmas period becomes increasingly important as a period of reflection to think about the year past and consider how we can be better in the year ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with many other Australians I have a Christmas wish this year. My Christmas wish is that the Labor Party will use the Christmas period this year to reflect upon their approach in this Senate chamber and to finally listen to the many voices, including some on their own side, that are calling on them to put the nation's interests ahead of their own political interests and actually get serious about dealing with the budget crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are some—chiefly Senator Dastyari—who greatly enjoy it when I mention this next gentleman during my contributions in this chamber, but I would like to spend a moment talking about Paul Keating. Paul Keating is not someone I have ever held great affection for in the past; but, this being the season of goodwill, I must confess that I have developed a real respect for him this year on a number of fronts. It seems that Mr Keating is also filled with the charitable spirit of Christmas this year. Just last Friday Mr Keating was asked for his appraisal of the way New South Wales Premier Mike Baird is performing in his role. His response: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think exceptionally well... there's only one reward in public life and that's public progress and the test of the relevance of leaders is can they get the job done? Can the state and the country be better? And I think in this case we are seeing a lot of positive changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Christmas cheer kept flowing as the former Labor Prime Minister warmly endorsed the New South Wales coalition government's infrastructure plan in stark contradiction to the Labor Party's stubborn opposition. Mr Keating's remark was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I support the Premier's view about this. There are still some obscurantists in the Labor party... there's still some there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Keating's contributions can sometimes send people scrambling for a dictionary; but, for those listening who may be unfamiliar with the term, an 'obscurantist' is someone opposing or hindering the spread of new ideas and new social or political developments. They are dogmatists. The thesaurus actually lists the word as an antonym for 'progressive', which is ironic for a political party that likes to think of itself as the progressive one. When I read Mr Keating's comments I was immediately struck by their relevance not just to the New South Wales Labor Party but to the prevailing attitudes displayed by members of the Labor Party in this Senate chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fitting that we are talking about Paul Keating as the year draws to a close, because the year quite literally began with Paul Keating urging this government to act swiftly to repair the budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>newspaper of 1 January this year, under the banner 'Old foes unite on economy', described comments from both Paul Keating and Labor's most successful ever leader, Bob Hawke, noting the similarities between the situation they faced in the mid-1980s and the situation inherited by the Abbott government. In that article Mr Keating said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The broad lesson is to inform the public of the problem and then earnestly pursue the remedies. When you're cutting outlays like we were, we had outlays growing at less than the inflation rate for a number of years, you've really got to want to do this. You've really got to have the skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that is true, of course, and the other thing you really have to have is a responsible opposition that is prepared to work constructively with the government of the day to deal with the budget challenge in the national interest. That is something Bob Hawke and Paul Keating had in the mid-1980s when John Howard, no less, put the fiscal and national interest ahead of opportunistic politics in supporting much of the Hawke-Keating reform agenda. Sadly, it seems Labor leaders today are made of smaller stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January Bob Hawke indicated that what was needed to deal decisively with the budget challenge was leaders who are 'prepared to make hard decisions'. In May the government brought forward its first budget. Whatever else people may say about it, no-one can accuse the government of lacking the will to make difficult decisions. This has not been an experience any of us have particularly enjoyed. It would be much easier, of course—much easier politically—for the government to say everything is fine, to go on spending, to pursue a Rudd-Gillard approach to governing. But I will say that, when presented with a choice of two approaches to economic management, the Hawke-Keating model on one side and the Rudd-Gillard model on the other, who in their right mind would opt for the Rudd-Gillard model? Yet, bizarrely, that is exactly what today's Labor Party is doing: ignoring the lessons of their own history and sticking with the Rudd-Gillard approach—an approach which significant Labor figures admit was a disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Less than a month ago another former Labor leader, Bill Hayden, in seeming despair at the attitude his old party has adopted, urged Labor to 'build economic credibility' because the budget in the future will require 'meticulous management'. Bill Hayden went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any opposition wanting to take government must demonstrate credibility on economic management. I actually felt that Julia Gillard may have been overextending herself fiscally on program commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have, of course, been others who have tried to warn the Labor Party over the course of the year. During Senate estimates the Treasury secretary summed up the frustration that many feel over Labor's stubborn refusal to even recognise, let alone help to repair the debt and deficit mess they left. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've been saying this, the governor of the Reserve Bank has been saying this, the head of the independent Parliamentary Budget Office has most recently said this last week. If the two most senior economic bureaucrats in the country are saying 'people we have a challenge and it's about time we had a serious community discussion' and the independent head of the Parliamentary Budget Office says the same thing, it's actually in the hands of the political class.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Parkinson, who was actually appointed by the former Labor government, has also criticised those who 'invoke vague notions of fairness' to oppose all budget repair. There is no prize for guessing to whom he might have been referring, because that is exactly what those opposite have been doing now for over six months. It seems they are yet to realise that 'complaint' and 'opposition' are not the same thing. Can anyone in this place or listening outside this evening think of a single, solid proposal for budget repair that has come from those opposite, who are actually the begetters of the budget mess this government must now fix? I can think of a great many complaints and promises to reverse savings this government has implemented but I honestly cannot think of a single policy idea the Labor Party have put forward this year that would actually improve our budget position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not mind honest disagreement—politics is after all about competing values and priorities—but the problem at the moment is that we do not know what Labor's values and priorities are. A grab bag of cliches about fairness and a vague promise that they will make things better somehow just does not cut it. That approach is no longer good enough. If those opposite are not prepared to support the government's savings measures, then let them bring forward their own savings measures. Let us hear your ideas. Is there anything in your Santa sack other than—and apologies to the Greens—just a lump of coal?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So my Christmas wish for this year is that, in the period of reflection available to the Labor Party over the Christmas break, they heed Paul Keating's advice about showing themselves to be leaders who can get the job done, they listen to Bill Hayden's urging for them to build economic credibility and they come back to this place in February next year prepared to behave rationally, as have oppositions in our past, and actually work with the government in the national interest to deal decisively with the budget challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion I extend my Christmas best wishes to those men and women of the Australian Defence Force serving our country overseas, particularly those in peacekeeping roles. I also extend my Christmas best wishes to the men and women on Operation Slipper in the Middle East area of operation who I had the great pleasure to meet in May this year on the Australian Parliamentary Defence Force Program. Merry Christmas.</span>

The minister for disabilities has given me a badge to wear to advertise and celebrate this day. The badge reads: '3rd of December marks International Day of People with Disability, a United Nations sanctioned day that unites people around the world in celebrating the achievements and contributions of people with disability.' I wholeheartedly agree with this day and acknowledge the important valuable contribution that people with disabilities give to the world, Australia and the state of Tasmania because, after an injury and a long battle with government bureaucracy, I also carry a disability—depression, and I have had to learn to cope with that—along with a back injury. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of that experience of being down and out for many years, I have made the decision to give people with disabilities who are suitably qualified a fair go when it comes to employing staff. The problem I have is that the Abbott government have obstructed and hindered me at every stage when I have tried to employ people with disabilities. They did it once when I tried to hire a former commando who suffered a brain injury after he was blown up in Afghanistan when serving his country and tonight I have to report to the Senate that the Liberal government have done it again. Despite all the policies, badges and fine speeches, Mr Abbott could not give a damn about people with disabilities. I say that with confidence because once again I have tried to employ a person with a disability and once again this government has failed to allow some reasonable workplace adjustments to ensure that this person is employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to my senior policy advisor Ms Barber, a person who is living with a disability and whose personal circumstances I am now forced to bring before this Senate because I have run out of options. The government, according to Senator Ronaldson, wants her unemployed tomorrow. The bizarre thing about my argument over my staff choice with Mr Abbott is that I can, with the travel arrangements I am requesting for Ms Barber, save the Commonwealth government about $5,000 per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did not want to have to put Ms Barber thought this public scrutiny. As a high-profile health whistleblower she has already been through enough, but both Ms Barber and I agree that this government, Prime Minister and Special Minister of State should be exposed for the frauds and hypocrites that they really are when it comes to employing and making reasonable workplace adjustments for people with disabilities.</span>

                  </a>  Ms Barber's professional skills are unique and have already benefited the people of Tasmania in many different ways, which I will describe in more detail in the future I am sure. However, tonight the important point I need to make is that as a former police officer, a health ethical standards officer, an expert Supreme Court witness in workers comp matters as well as a chief medical board investigator Ms Barber has invaluable practical and legislative skills, which are rare to find in one person who is so easy and trustworthy to work with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of all the injuries accumulated during her long history of distinguished public service Ms Barber now suffers from disabilities, which her GP and psychologist have confirmed in writing to our PM and Minister Ronaldson. Despite being informed of those injuries, our Prime Minister and Senator Ronaldson refuse to allow Ms Barber to work from a non-standard work location. In short, according to her doctors, the best way for Ms Barber to medically manage her disabilities is for her to live in Brisbane close to her family and her professional medical support team and commute to Canberra for Senate sitting weeks. This simple workplace adjustment for a person with a genuine disability is too much for our PM to agree to, especially on this International Day of People with Disability. I just want the nation to know just how cruel and unreasonable the PM is being in his actions.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  I rise tonight to thank and acknowledge all of those people around the country who are providing the real opposition to the Abbott government. If it is your view that democracy is about putting a piece of paper in a box once every few years and hoping for the best, then you are really leaving that concept of opposition to the politicians who file in here for 19 weeks of the year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think that idea has ever been tenable, but everywhere we look the flaws in this hands-off model of delegated democracy are becoming more evident by the day. Parliament alone has not been able to stop Prime Minister Abbott waging a debilitating assault on the solar and wind energy industries that are finally reaching critical mass around the world. Parliament has not stopped the gruesome human rights abuses carried out at the behest of Minister Scott Morrison. It has blunted, but not halted the sadistic budget measures that have targeted some of the most vulnerable people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So tonight I want to pay my respects to all of those people whose view of democracy and political agency is more expansive than numbering boxes on a piece of paper from time to time, to celebrate your hard fought successes and honour your irreplaceable losses. Those who stood in the way of machinery at Challar Forest, Walmadan and the Weld Valley, who are standing today at Maules Creek, the Pilliga, and East Gippsland, you speak for me. To those gearing up for direct action clashes at Point Peron and the beautiful Beeliar wetlands, you represent an extraordinary lineage of Australians stepping up in defence of country that stretches back for as long as people have lived here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Jon Moylan and your supporters, and everyone who spent this year turning the divestment movement from a an interesting idea into a material financial risk to those fossil interests and their investment backers who would otherwise risk everything, I cannot thank you enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you work or employ people in the clean energy sector and are coming to grips with the idea that your government might not just be indifferent to your industry but actively hostile, all I can say is: please, hang in there. It matters to us all that your industry succeeds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These so many in this community whose names we will never know who stand up for those who need a hand, even when they have very little themselves. These are the people for whom this government's extraordinary budget initiatives are not measured in statistics, but in lives. Getting to know Jon and Nic Shapiro, Bevan, Owen, Mort and others of those in my hometown dealing with the dark side of the housing boom has been one of the most moving experiences of 2014. Instead of being crushed by homelessness, you banded together and fought back and have taught us all about what compassionate resistance and defiance to callous government policy actually looks like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all of those at all levels of community building, from planners and developers to public transport advocates and architects, and all those who see our cities and settlements not just as they are, but how they could be, thank you for your inspiration, expertise and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of all, I want to acknowledge the original sovereigns and custodians of this ancient land for your patience and extraordinary courage in the face of continued appropriation of country and erasure of your history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes this year I have felt beaten down by the sheer relentless aggression of a government that lied its way into office and seems to announce one harmful or casually abusive new initiative every single day. I cannot remember an Australian executive so brazenly, unashamedly owned by the big end of town as this government—and it shows nakedly in decisions at every level, from tax and welfare policy to public transport and energy strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this government failing. The people who gave up months of their lives to help hold our Western Australian Senate seat this April know it. The team who posted a historic effort and several wins for the Victorian Greens this last weekend, they know it too. The press gallery knows it. Rupert Murdoch knows it. The polling companies know it. For reasons unintended, this government is unifying the Australian community. To everyone engaged in this project of taking our country back, not from this government or the individuals—and there are many good people inside the Liberal and National parties, and I know that from many years of working in this building—so not from this government but from the ideas that propel it, my warmest thanks and best wishes for a restful and peaceful break, time with families and loved ones. If you are part of the opposition to this government, whether you are in this building or outside it, thank you for everything that you do. </span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to throw my support behind the work that Mr Hutchinson has done towards reducing the coastal shipping disadvantage that Tasmania, Australia's only island state, is burdened with. On Monday, 1 December this year—just at the beginning of this week—Mr Hutchinson made a speech in the other place that clearly illustrated the issues that Tasmania and indeed Australia faces in regard to coastal shipping matters. It followed an opinion that was published in one of the Tasmanian papers on the same subject, drawing together the results of his deep and significant consultation and consideration of the challenges that Tasmanians face as a result of Bass Strait's existence. Mr Hutchison said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The changes to coastal shipping in 2009 and again in 2012 under the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012, particularly in relation to cabotage rules, damaged our nation's competitiveness, decreased productivity on our vital coastal shipping routes and pushed up costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was on the Economics Committee at the time that examine this legislation and authored a dissenting report from the Labor majority report. The fears that were represented in that dissenting report have come to pass and have been quite effectively highlighted by Mr Hutchinson in the work that he has been doing on this matter recently. Mr Hutchinson went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Higher costs have seen manufacturers in aluminium, cement and fuel refining have no choice but to use coastal shipping for their product and raw materials and a number of these businesses have closed in recent years as a result of dramatically higher rates for coastal shipping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hutchinson further said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the changes by Labor have impacted nationally but as an island state, nowhere has been harder hit than in my state of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The last international vessel to service Tasmania the AAA service stopped at Bell Bay and other domestic ports on the east coast before heading back to Singapore. This service ceased under the changes made by the previous government overseen by the Member for Grayndler, Anthony Albanese.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hutchinson pointed out that the AAA service was deemed unviable. More volume moved on Bass Strait and, with no competition due to the competitiveness of Australian ships, prices went up. In fact, the number of major Australian registered ships with licences to move coastal freight fell from 30 in 2006-07 to just 13 by 2012-13. If I recall correctly, at the time of the 2009 changes, there were 17—so it has been a steady decline, and it was supposed to reverse that. I have heard a lot of evidence from those who were proponents of those bills—they were saying that it would actually reverse that decline. The number of vessels has marginally risen since 2012-13, but the deadweight tonnage has plummeted by 64 per cent over the last two years. In any consideration of this matter, this is the telling metric—the amount of deadweight tonnage that is actually being removed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state government at the time, after ignoring the problem for two years hoping it would go away, responded with a policy of going into competition with the private businesses plying Bass Strait. As Mr Hutchinson said: 'The then opposition, now government, committed $33 million over three years to entice—encourage, if you will, subsidise—a service to return to Tasmania and service hubs in Asia. No more starkly can you see the financial impact flowing as a direct result of Labor's changes in government than in Tasmania. Multiply that cost around the country and consider the length of our coastline, and you can imagine the impact on business that relied on such services.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hutchinson's words illustrate the high level of wisdom and maturity he brings to this important topic—important particularly to Tasmanians. Furthermore, his passion for improving the lot of Tasmanian businesses, workers and the community is clearly evident from this body of work. Mr Hutchinson—and I might add, his Liberal colleagues Mr Nikolic and Mr Whiteley—are amongst the hardest working and most consultative members in this parliament. The electorate of Lyons is amongst the most beautiful in Australia. It includes the extraordinary beauty of Tasmania's central highlands through to the majestic east coast, including places like the majestic Freycinet National Park. It also contains areas of significant historical and cultural significance such as Port Arthur and many historic towns. Mr Hutchinson's presence in so many local communities often appears to be superhuman. In a morning, Mr Hutchinson may appear at a local school on the east coast, and in the same day he may be visiting an agricultural business in the Derwent Valley—and then a community forum in the north of the state. He often spends more hours on the road than some members of parliament spend at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all else, Mr Hutchinson is a member who listens to his constituents and takes action to improve the lives of everyday Tasmanians who, sadly, have suffered 16 years of neglect under, until recently, an ineffective Labor state government and an arrogant and lazy local Labor federal MP. I welcome the work that Mr Hutchinson is doing in Tasmania. At long last there is a genuine feeling in the community that things are improving and the economy is stirring—and this is due in no small part to the Liberal trio of Mr Hutchinson, Mr Nikolic and Mr Whiteley.</span>
