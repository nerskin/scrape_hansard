                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. This piece of legislation, together with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, provides a new framework for strengthening illicit tobacco offences by removing existing obstacles to prosecution. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018 is currently before the Senate, and Labor has agreed to support that bill, as I outlined in this place on the 28 February. Naturally Labor will support the bill currently before the House, because we believe in cracking down on illicit tobacco as well as eliminating smoking related illness and death. Illicit tobacco refers to tobacco sold to Australian consumers without the payment of relevant taxes. There are several types of illicit tobacco, including contraband, which is manufactured legally outside of Australia and smuggled into the country; counterfeit, which is manufactured illegally without permissions and smuggled into Australia; and unbranded tobacco, which usually comes in loose leaf and is known colloquially as chop-chop. I suppose the Australian public would know that one more than the others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report <span style="font-style:italic;">Illicit tobacco in Australia</span> released on 20 April this year by KPMG states that Australian tobacco consumption for the 2017 calendar year was 15.6 million kilograms, and around 15 per cent of this, or 2.3 million kilograms, was illicit tobacco. According to the report, the illicit tobacco consumed would have had an estimated excise value of $1.91 billion if it had been consumed legally. There are, however, other estimates of this figure because measuring the illicit tobacco market is, naturally, inherently difficult. The Department of Home Affairs has estimated the excise value at between $0.5 billion and $2.3 billion, whilst others have estimated the cost to the Australian public purse to be up to $6 billion. Regardless of this figure, as illicit tobacco enters the market, lost excise normally charged as a tax or duty is not being collected by the Australian government to be spent on other services such as health, infrastructure, education et cetera for our society and our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week two students in Sydney's north were arrested after attempting to import 778 kilograms of loose-leaf tobacco sent as sea cargo from China, with the excise for this shipment alone estimated to be worth more than $780,000. I commend the Australian Border Force officers for intercepting this shipment in Adelaide last month and for the daily work they do in protecting our borders. Another such instance uncovered by Australian Border Force officials was an alleged Chinese syndicate smuggling into Australia tobacco and cigarettes hidden in children's toys. There are other instances I could outline to the House. For example, six tonnes of illegal tobacco leaves and vast fields of mature plants worth more than $13 million in excise were seized in a raid on a rural property in the Northern Territory in July. The media has reported these events on numerous occasions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard from my own constituents and from small business operators in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland stories about businesses being undercut by those purportedly selling illicit tobacco to sometimes unknowing customers who think they're just getting cheaper cigarettes and cheaper tobacco. In Queensland, as recently as Saturday, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Queensland Times</span> reported that a local store in Ipswich in my electorate was selling 50 grams of loose-leaf tobacco for just $20, compared to $69 in the supermarket. Illicit tobacco may seem harmless, but purchasing it actually helps fund the criminal networks that run these operations. They use illicit tobacco as one of the many branches of their criminal operations, which include such things as human trafficking, people smuggling, illicit use of firearms and drug smuggling. People who innocently buy tobacco on the cheap from local shops may be surprised to find out they may be partaking of this illicit tobacco trade. They're actually funding these operations by buying chop-chop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must take every step possible to crack down on illicit tobacco and the people who run these illegal operations. Since 1 July 2015, over 114 people have been charged with tobacco related border offences. However, only 69 of those charged have been successfully prosecuted under the Customs Act. There are a number of limitations with the existing tobacco related revenue evasion offences in the Customs Act and the Excise Act because the offences are inconsistent. The Customs Act offences only apply when knowledge of defrauding or intention to defraud revenue can be proven. By comparison, the Excise Act offences are associated with relatively low penalties and do not provide a sufficient deterrent to those dealing in illicit tobacco. Events can only be successfully prosecuted if it can be proven whether tobacco was imported or produced domestically. Because of these inconsistencies, neither officers of customs, who administer the Customs Act, nor officers of the Australian Taxation Office, who administer the Excise Act, are currently able to target the full range of illicit tobacco offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House amends the Customs Act 1901 to create two new offences in respect of importing illicit tobacco based on recklessness and ensures customs officers can investigate and enforce new illicit tobacco offences relating to the proof of origin in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. In addition to this, there are paragraphs that create new offences which lower the standard of proof from intention to defraud or knowledge of defrauding revenue to recklessness. Recklessness is a lower standard of culpability than intention or knowledge. With these amendments, customs officers will be able to target a wider range of participants in the illegal tobacco trade and strengthen the illicit tobacco enforcement regime in Australia. In turn, this will allow greater opportunities for successful prosecution of those involved in the illicit tobacco market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes to extend the power to arrest without warrant under section 210 of the Customs Act if an officer of customs or police believes on reasonable grounds the person has committed or is committing an offence. Labor supports this. It should be noted, however, that the power of arrest without a warrant can only be exercised if an officer believes on reasonable grounds that proceedings by summons against a person would not achieve one or more of the several purposes set out in the Customs Act. It's appropriate for the power to arrest without warrant to be extended to prevent the continuation of illicit tobacco offences and to ensure that people appear before the court in relation to those offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we welcome the measure to combat illicit tobacco, we on this side of the House are always prepared to hold this out-of-touch Turnbull government to account. As I referred to in my second reading amendment, the Turnbull government is relying on a one-off tobacco tax collection timing trick to help them bring up a budget surplus. In the 2018-19 budget, the Turnbull government miraculously announced that they were going to achieve surplus in 2019-20, a year earlier than previously anticipated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, importers who import tobacco are required to pay duty when the tobacco leaves a warehouse. As a result of this, there have been instances of tobacco being removed from warehouses without duty being paid, resulting in the illicit tobacco entering the Australian supply chain. In an effort to combat this, from 1 July 2019 importers will be required to pay all duty and tax liability when tobacco enters the country rather than when it leaves a licensed warehouse and enters the domestic market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this measure, the Turnbull government announced a transitional measure, with importers having 12 months to pay tax on tobacco stored in warehouses. This means that, instead of duty being collected in the latter years, when it leaves a warehouse the revenue of over $3 billion will be collected in the 2019-20 financial yearâa timing trick perpetrated to achieve a budget surplus. The 2019-20 financial year is also the year in which the Turnbull government says it will reach a $2.2 billion surplusâa $2.2 billion surplus and a $3 billion timing trick to achieve it. The Turnbull government is using the risk of illicit tobacco entering the market to reach a surplus a year earlier than they previously anticipated or expected to announce it. It is clear that, without this one-off tobacco tax collection timing trick, the Turnbull government would not be able to achieve a surplus in 2019-20 as they claim they will. I note that this measure will require another piece of legislation, currently titled the Customs Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties at the Border) Bill in the legislation proposed to be introduced in the spring sittings, as circulated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is awaiting this legislation to be introduced in the House and the government's further admission that without this additional revenue they will not be able to achieve a surplus one year ahead of schedule. Of course Labor have supported measures before the House when we've seen better and more improved economic reforms to pay down Australia's debt and to ensure bigger surpluses and a fair and sustainable taxation system for all Australians. For example, this plan from our side of the chamber involves capital gains tax reforms and reforms in relation to excessive dividend imputation credits, which crack down on an unsustainable tax loophole that gives tax refunds to people who don't actually pay income tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has made a strong commitment historically in relation to getting rid of the scourge of smoking. Smoking accounts for 15,000 deaths every year in this country. Policy reforms implemented by former Labor governments made significant advancements towards drastically reducing that numberâfor example, what Australia did under the last Labor government in becoming the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. We also increased the excise rate applying to tobacco products by 25 per cent as part of our budget, and we commend the government for mimicking what we had to do. We invested moneyâfor example, $61 million in a national tobacco campaign. We introduced legislation to bring restrictions on internet advertising of tobacco products into line with advertising on other media. We took a strong, principled stance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there are parties on the other side of the chamber who have been shamelessly accepting donations from big tobacco. The latest records from the Australian Electoral Commission show that the National Party accepted $15,700 in donations from the tobacco industry in the 2016-17 financial year. This is simply not good enough. It's not good enough to say one thing in this chamber, to say one thing about the tobacco scourge and reducing deaths and illness in relation to tobacco related illness in this country, but to do another thing in Canberra or organisationally in your party. We don't think that's good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Prime Minister should explain why it's acceptable for his coalition partners to fill their coffers with donations from the tobacco industry. On this side of the chamber we've consistently shown our commitment to policies to reduce the instances of tobacco related illness and disease in this country. We support the passage of this bill through the House to stop the scourge of illicit tobacco and ultimately improve health outcomes for all Australians. I commend the legislation and the amendment to the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  The Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, with measures making policing of the market in illicit tobacco more fit for purpose, is a very important part of the long-running, largely bipartisan effort to reduce the human and dollar costs of smoking. These costs come in at around 15,000 lives and $30 billion in health services on an annual basis, and we can add to that a recent and rapidly increasing loss of revenue from the surging black market in illicit tobacco. These are enormous costs, and governments at all levelsâfederal, state and localâhave been working to reduce them since the mid-1990sâwith considerable success, I might add.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As recently as the mid-1990s, almost one-quarter of all Australian adults smoked. That is now down to about 13 per cent, with the trend suggesting it can and will be driven considerably lower, saving lives and billions of dollars, in what has been a remarkable policy turnaround spaced over several decades. In the 1930s, before the links between smoking and disease were established, the tobacco industry in Australia was actually promoted and protected. Federal law in that era required that 50 per cent of the tobacco in cigarettes be Australian grown, which embedded a strong tobacco-growing industry in Queensland and Victoria. The proportion of local content was even boosted, to 57 per cent, as late as 1977.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But progressively, and certainly very strongly by the early 1990s, a range of factors came into play that led to a pretty sudden and absolute about-face. Freer trade, with significantly lower tariffs, meant that previous constraints on the importation of cheaper tobacco were reduced, which in turn crippled the relatively high-cost local industry. After a restructuring scheme, the industry shrank from about 600 growers in the 1970s to no growers by 2006. Almost simultaneously, there was a growing awareness of the appalling health and financial costs of smoking, which quickly gave rise to a highly effective legislative and regulatory campaign against tobacco use in this country. Advertising was banned in 1992, and since then, especially over the past decade, antitobacco, pro-taxpayer measures have proliferated. Excise was increased by 25 per cent in 2010. Plain packaging with graphic health warnings was instituted in 2011. In 2013, annual 12Â½ per cent increases in excise began, going through to 2017. In the 2016-17 budget, those increases were extended through to 2020 as part of a broader package of measures instituted by this government to increase the national effort against smoking, with this bill being part of that package. As a result, thousands of lives will be extended, and many billions of dollars will now be available for more productive work on behalf of Australian taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the success of this ongoing campaign to reduce the human cost and the dollar cost of tobacco consumption has created major challenges for law enforcement. As a direct result of having created the most expensive tobacco market in the world, we have made ourselves a big target for illegal products, especially from countries to our north, who have some of the lowest tobacco prices in the world. In China, for example, a pack of 20 cigarettes retails for about $3.40, compared with about $25 to $26 here. In South Korea, the price is about $3.60. In Indonesia, it's under $2 a pack. The temptation for criminals is obvious: produce or buy cheaply in any number of countries then smuggle the product into Australia, deliberately avoiding customs duties, and you'll make a lot of money. Today's illicit tobacco trade operates in much the same way cheap booze from Canada and the Caribbean flooded into the United States during the prohibition eraâto enrich and empower vast criminal enterprises. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ATO and the Department of Home Affairs estimate that almost $600 million in tobacco duty was forgone in the 2015-16 financial year due to Australia's illicit tobacco trade. Regular reports by KPMG that seek to quantify the scale of the illegal market suggest the cost of this illicit tobacco could be as high as $1Â½ billion in avoided duties, based on the estimate that about 14 per cent of tobacco sold in Australia is now illegal. If KPMG is right, one in seven cigarettes smoked in Australia avoid excise duty. The impact of that at a national level is twofold. One is revenue lost. Tobacco taxes currently contribute around $9 billion annually for taxpayers, with that number set to grow exponentially given the ongoing big increases in excise. By 2020, excise revenue will likely be around $13 billion. The second highly likely impact is a reduction in the rate at which people either quit or resist the smoking habit due to an increasingly ready access to cheap illicit tobacco products. Should this impact be felt, any resurgence of tobacco use will, as a consequence, have a discernible negative impact on national life expectancy and health costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in addition to the border national impacts of lower revenue and higher health costs, there are also some very important local impacts, including loss of income for many hardworking small businesses who are in fact selling the real deal, the real thing. While regularly doorknocking businesses across my electorate, it has become apparent to me how many small businesses are being hurt by this illicit trade. Many of these are convenience stores; they're tobacconists; they're newsagenciesâbusinesses that already operate on very tight margins, and they rely on their local trade. These businesses already face the challenge of supplying a highly regulated product to an even smaller customer baseâa customer base that has reduced significantly over the years, as we have already noted. However, while it has been government policy for many years to discourage tobacco use and offset the burgeoning public health cost, these retailers do remain law-abiding tax-paying businesses. These are Australian businesses, employing Australians. And while the ultimate public policy objective, through education, excise and regulation, remains consistent, this does not mean that small businesses should face the added burden of aggressive competition from a criminal black market in illicit tobacco. Clearly we need to increase our efforts to not just stall the growth of smuggled product but cut into it as deeply as possible with tougher laws and more rigorous controls at the border via new agencies, such as the Tobacco Strike Team recently established by Australian Border Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's one task, but it's not the only one, because a second layer of activity in relation to excise avoidance is now also in play, with illegal onshore tobacco cultivation making something of a comeback. In March last year, a crop worth $11 million was discovered in New South Wales near Cooma. In March this year, 4.2 tonnes of tobacco leaf and 12 acres of crop were discovered near Ballarat in Victoria. In April, in the largest cross-agency investigation that that Australian tax office has been involved in, a $60 million operation was discovered in the Bundaberg region in Queensland. There are many other examples, but that sample is indicative of the fact that the profit motive for criminals intent on avoiding their liability to pay excise duty has grown domestically as well as internationally, in lock step with the increase in tobacco price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a 2015 report, the Australian Crime Commission suggested that organised crime syndicates are deeply involved in this multibillion dollar racket because the rewards are great and, currently, the risks are slight. The very clear likelihoodâthe inevitability, you could sayâis that this sort of activity is going to increase unless it is checked by tougher laws and more rigorous activity by our border and tax authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill involves giving Australian Border Force personnel improved tools for dealing what has proved to be a significant problem in prosecuting smugglers at the border under the current form of the Customs Act. The act requires that, in order to lay the groundwork for a prosecution, knowledge or intent by principals to avoid excise-equivalent customs duty is required. Experience has established that proving such knowledge or intent to the level necessary for a successful prosecution is extremely difficult. Indeed, it is nigh on impossible in the face of people who are well-trained agents of, typically, highly organised crime syndicates, with a fine understanding of the fact that the Australian law requires extremely high levels of proof.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill therefore amends the Customs Act. The Customs Act will be changed to reduce the onus from knowledge or intent to avoid duties to one of recklessness, whereby perpetrators will be culpable for what is a lesser offence if it is established that their involvement with the importation of illicit product was undertaken with a reckless attitude towards whether duty was intended to be paid or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other linked measures are contained in a separate bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill, which was introduced into the parliament on 15 February. That bill eases one of the biggest problems that officers of the Australian Taxation Office have in prosecuting matters around illicit tobacco when it is discovered beyond the border. A current requirement of the law is that officers must be able to determine whether the product they are dealing with has been produced domestically or overseas to establish whether the issue is one of customs duty or excise evasion. That is a requirement that has also proved extremely difficult to establish. Attempts have been made to analyse samples to establish whether their origins are local or international to settle that question, but such is the nature of tobacco plants that that has proved impossible. Lack of cooperation from those being investigated, or their lack of knowledge, can stymie authorities on the spot. The Treasury bill therefore removes the need to establish origin. What will have to be established is a reasonable suspicion that either customs duty or excise duty has been avoided, whatever the actual source of the product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important battle and these are important bills in that context. At stake is an improvement in life expectancy for a significant number of Australians. At stake is the massive health bill that this significant number incur. Also at stake are billions of dollars in revenue that should accrue on behalf of taxpayers but is currently going to criminals and often to well-organised crime syndicates that channel their gains to help finance even further crime. Destroying this criminal enterprise completely may be beyond us. Nonetheless, doing all we can to minimise it remains our key responsibility, and it's for these reasons that I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I would like to continue on from the contribution of the member for Fairfax, an excellent contribution no less, to this important discussion around the Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. The basis of my short remarks is to support the bill and the spirit and the intent in which it seeks to achieve its outcome in the context of existing law, because I do have broader concerns about the operation of the regulatory framework and the way in which we engage with this productâtobaccoâand the consequences it has in fuelling the illicit trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Illegal tobacco threatens the safety and health of our community and the viability of local business operators, and the measures in this bill will arm customs officers, Border Force agents, with the tools to fight organised crime and their illegal tobacco trade. I don't dispute its objectives, and they're very good ones, and that's the basis upon which I will be supporting this bill. But we also cannot forget part of the reason we are in this situation. It is because of the measures that we have taken to date and what they have done to fuel the illicit trade. I was not in this parliament at the time these matters were considered, but had I been I would have raised my deep reservation around, particularly, some of the ways that we sought to tackle the challenges around illicit tobacco, as well as the incapacity, or the inability, to address some issues that we confront today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2013 to 2016, Australia's smoking rate fell by a dismal 0.6 per cent. This came off the back of a long period of reform to try and reduce the consumption of tobacco. In many cases, I support those measures. As somebody for whom tobacco contributed to the early death of three out of four grandparents, I believe strongly in tackling these issues. But we made a series of questionable judgements in the past. The first is the constant increase in tax rates and excise on tobacco. This makes it a more desirable product because the cost basis of production is becoming increasingly distant from the price of consumption. That gap, or the consumer surplus that grows with the increase in the tax rate, means that it becomes a more desirable product for organised crime, because the margins that can be secured from engaging in the trade are considerable. And that will not change. So long as we keep the excise at the rate that it is we will continue to encourage illegal gangs and those engaging in ill means to engage in the illicit tobacco trade. But we've doubled down on that by not just increasing the tax rate, increasing the consumer surplus and increasing the desirability and attractiveness of this trade by increasing the tax rate; we have also increased the desirability of this product by making it interchangeable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of parliaments ago this parliament introduced plain packaging legislation in the Commonwealth of Australia. And what was the consequence of plain packaging? It took a product that was already of high value and had a high consumer surplus and said, 'Now it is interchangeable, indistinguishable.' That's the whole point of plain packaging legislationâto take a product and remove its branding so consumers can see no difference, while at the same time increasing and ratcheting up the price. So, its desirability goes up, it's capacity to be engaged in counterfeiting and illicit production increases even more dramatically, as do the benefits of illicit trade. This is the fundamental problem with this approach to dealing with issues around tobacco regulation. You're actually fuelling, or at least increasing the risk of fuelling, the illicit trade, mostly to the benefit of criminal gangs. That's what comes out very clearly in different pieces of research and reports. We know that illicit consumption is up. We know the illicit trade is up. We know that the loss to government revenue continues to increase, year on year, and it's aided and abetted by the measures that have been consistently applied by previous parliaments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for us, if we want to cut tobacco consumptionâand I doâis to introduce measures that actually help cut consumption, reduce the desirability for criminal gangs to be involved in the trade and to take advantage of the consequences of our legislative arrangements, and look at measures that work. We actually did an entire inquiry, in the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, on the legal accessibility of e-cigarettes and vaporisers and the legalisation of vaping as an alternative to smoking. What the data showed from these reports, looking at international research and the experience of other countriesâeven when I was in Manchester only recently speaking to health officialsâis a very clear and consistent message. People did not think that vaping was necessarily the best measure that they would like to see. They'd rather see people quit, as would I. If they don't quit, particularly those stubborn lifelong smokers, then in the absence of that finding a harm reduction alternative is incredibly important. Vaping fills that critical and important gap. That is so much so that, as I learned when I was in the UK recently and spoke to health officials in Manchester, they now actively promote it as a measure to help reduce people's consumption and behaviour in light of the circumstances. So we put that against the backdrop of what we've been doing in tobacco, which is making it more profitable and more substitutable for criminal gangs, but we haven't then gone on and said that we should support the measures that we need to make sure that we can actually cut smoking rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that I have real concerns about the framework of the approach that many people are taking in this policy space, because it's not actually cutting smoking rates. It is rewarding criminals. It's not helping the consumers. It's also not helping, of course, one of the critical bases on which we have been told we have to support various bits of legislation, which is to increase government revenue to offset the consequences of tobacco consumption. Sadly and tragically, this approach that we have taken, for which we have sometimes been extolled internationally for being a world leader, is being adopted everywhere else. That isn't to say that there isn't a role for tax as part of disincentivising people from consuming tobacco. That's true, and that is a critical part of what we need to do, because there are some people who do have an inelastic approach and do need that incentive. But it would be foolhardy to say that it has not gone to quite incredible extremes in recent years. As I said, when you overlay that with the issues around plain packaging, you see the same consequences. We know that other countries have followed suit and followed us. Despite extolling the virtues of the plans around these policies, the UK, Ireland, France and New Zealand have, frankly, had deeply questionable outcomes, as we have, in the efficacy of these policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when we talk about the efficacy of these policies, yes, we're talking about things like government revenue. That's an impact, but the real impact is on human lives. Sadly, there are too many health sociologists parading themselves as public health officials who would rather keep supporting bad ideas they've come up with and taken ownership of than do the right thing and change the laws to enable people to have a pathway to reduce their consumption and hopefully move towards cessation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hope that this parliament takes note. I would hope that this parliament seeks to consider other alternatives to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia and to improve the livelihoods, the health and the wellbeing of Australians who are caught in the trap and curse of tobacco consumption and nicotine addiction. That is why I am a proud supporter of people being able to access vaporisers and vape legally, not just with vaporisers but also with the capsules. If you want to introduce a policy framework which actually cuts tobacco consumption, that is the pathway in which you do it, on top of constraining and suffocating the criminal gangs who engage in taking advantage of the consequences of the laws we now have on the book. The consequences of the laws are the increase in the price of a product, the increase in the consumer surplus and the increase in the gap between the production and the consumption and the price, which makes it a very profitable industry for those who want ill-gotten gains. The measures we have taken have also made it a substitutable product, which has only exacerbated the already existing problems of that regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I support this bill, because ultimately it works to empower and enable those Customs officers to do what they need to do to suffocate that trade. But that trade can be supported in its suffocation by reducing demand from consumers, because people no longer see the advantage of engaging in tobacco consumption and see the advantage of alternatives as a pathway to at least harm minimisation and hopefully cessation. If we do that, we would have a healthier, happier, longer living nation of people, with reduced dependence on nicotine addiction.</span>

                    </a>  I know I'm not alone in supporting this important issue in this parliament. I know a number of other members have spoken very directly about the importance of reducing tobacco consumption, some on the other side of this parliament and some on this side of the chamber as well. I know that there are other members who have been steadfast, dutiful and loyal to the pursuit of trying to reduce consumption, like the member for North Sydney and the member for Bowman, who support me on the quest to try to remove the barriers that stop people from getting off tobacco and onto alternatives, particularly vaporisers. I congratulate them for their efforts, their leadership and their courage in standing and doing the right thing. I wish I could see many more people stand up and follow their leadership on this important issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same way, I'd like to see an honest assessment of and honest reflection on the challenges we face in the tobacco consumption space and a proper consideration of the laws that are already on the books. I remember that back in the day when legislative arrangements around plain packaging were introduced, people said it was going to deliver all these wonderful things. But the truth is that consumption largely stagnated. It didn't actually have that effect, but we've gone on and extolled its virtues all around the world, mostly to fan the notoriety, professionalism and awards showered on the former health minister. But has it actually delivered the outcome? It's a classic problem that many people, including people like Milton Friedman used to argue, which is that you shouldn't judge a policy on its intent, but on its outcomes. When you judge a policy on its intent and not its outcomes, this is the situation you end up withâ</span>

                    </a>  This is the consequence when you judge a policy on its intent and not its outcomes: you have a ballooning illicit trade, which is to the benefit of those people who, let's face it, are the scum of the earthâorganised gangs and those who seek to take advantage of the legislative arrangements and work the consequences of legislation and regulation to their own commercial benefit. I would have thought that people in this parliament would look at that situation and say, 'It is a travesty.' We have, of course, seen this before. If we go back to the prohibition movement in the United States in the 1920s, unsurprisingly, people produced products at a low price but were able to charge high prices because of their seemingly illicit and illegal nature. What occurred, of course, was that people found ways to profiteer and to make enormous benefits out of it for their own personal gain. And, frankly, they left a trail of human tragedy and misery behind them; but that did not concern them, hence I use the expression 'scum of the earth'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the problem that we continue to face in this policy space. That's why we have to reflect very seriously on our policy objectives and what we're seeking to do in terms of achieving them and implementing them. We know that where there is a regulation that is unjust or has some sort of exceptional consequence, particularly for an interchangeable product, there is a way around it. There has been a long tradition of this. I used the example going back to the prohibition movement, where people found justifications to continue their consumption of alcohol. Some people used to shroud it in the environment of their faith and that they needed it as part of their access to faith. But, more critically, even people who were trying to do the right thing and comply with the law found ways around itâlike people selling hops, barley and water and putting warning signs up: 'Warning, if you mix these ingredients then you will break the law and create beer.' That's how people got around it and took advantage of the legislative arrangements. Those are the sorts of lessons we should learn from and not repeat.</span>

As those members well knowâindeed, as some of them have raised it with me on prior occasionsâcriminals who profit from the trade in illicit tobacco undermine the government's strategies to promote good public health outcomes and they threaten the viability of law-abiding local business operators.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill enhances border and law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate and prosecute the illegal importation of tobacco and supports the new illicit tobacco offences contained in the related Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. Together these two bills establish a comprehensive set of offences targeting the importation, possession, purchase, sale and production of illicit tobacco. The amendments will make it easier for the Australian Border Force and the Australian Taxation Office to investigate and prosecute criminals who are involved in the illicit tobacco trade, regardless of its origin, whether smuggled or grown domestically. New offences will allow enforcement officers to target a wider range of participants in the illicit tobacco trade and will enable our courts to impose severe fines and lengthy prison sentences on criminals who engage in deliberate and highly calculated defrauding of the Australian public.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The framework the government seeks to legislate is backed up by our commitment to over $70 million in funding to the ABF-led Illicit Tobacco Taskforce in the 2018-19 budget. Together with its predecessor, the Tobacco Strike Team, the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce has seen considerable operational success since its establishment, including as recently as last weekend. Last financial year the ABF detected more than 240 million cigarettes and 217 tonnes of tobacco at the border. Worth over $356 million, it evaded duty that would otherwise have belonged to the Australian taxpayers, the Australian public. While it has been illegal to grow tobacco in Australia for over a decade, since July 2016 the ATO has seized 231 tonnes of illicit tobacco, worth an estimated $194 million in forgone tobacco duty.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  I will begin by formally moving the amendment distributed in my name, and I understand that it will be seconded by the member for Lingiari, and I thank him for that. So, I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that the Turnbull Government has failed to ensure that the collection of levies and charges which are directed to our agriculture-based research and development corporations enables a greater effort to improve the take-up of the best and latest farm management practices, particularly in light of the current drought crisis".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've deliberately moved that after giving it some thought, for very important reasons. Obviously the opposition will be supporting the bill before the House. This is about the third attempt by this government to get what is a fairly simple change in the legislation. It's a very significant change, but very simple in legislative terms. It should not have been so difficult. In fact I think the first time I spoke on a bill related to these changes was in March 2016. The government clearly was unable to have the legislation passed through the parliament before the July 2016 election. Then we had another go after the election and that bill secured passage. On both occasions, during the debates I warned that there were real and meaningful concerns about the lack of protections around the way in which levy payer information might be shared with third parties. One of the things that this bill does is give greater confidence that that assurance has now been forthcoming, although I do note that in the Senate committee report there are some ongoing concerns, particularly around the excessive use of delegated executive power rather than enshrining some of these measures in legislation. But these are very difficult to fix from opposition. We will let this bill go through in its current form and give the system an opportunity to work and to work well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight two points. I'll return to them both. First of all, our research and development corporation structure, its architecture and the way it operates is in need of review. The second point is that I think it is wrong and inappropriate for us to be speaking on agriculture matters in this chamber at this point in time without having a conversation about drought. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, we are certainly in the worst drought since the 1960s and, if we don't receive meaningful rain in the not-too-distant future, we will almost certainly be in the worst drought in the history of European settlement. Many farmers are hurting, and hurting badly, along with their families. At this point in time it should be a priority for this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It disappoints me again that there are no members of the government speaking on this bill. I see the member for Calare in the House. He may be on chamber duty or he may be a late addition to speak on the bill; I'm not sure. But this is not just today; this is now a trend. Week in, week out, in parliamentary sittings, I find myself in here talking to my colleagues. That is wonderful and fine, because they all have a deep and abiding interest in matters to do with agriculture and are certainly concerned about the drought; but I never see any speakers on the government's side. What is the explanation for this absence? You could come to many conclusions. I like to think they haven't abandoned the agriculture sectorâsurely not. It's such a substantial part of our national economy. I suspect they're just a bit shy about coming in here these days to try to defend the record, behaviour and lack of achievement of this government. I remember that just after the 2013 election it was quite the opposite. Because they had so many members of the National Party, for exampleâI concede that a number of Liberals represent regional seatsâthey'd be in here en masse wanting to talk about agriculture policy and the issues impacting upon agriculture. But these days they don't turn up at all. It's very curious. I think they're just embarrassed. I don't think they want to be in here defending the Turnbull government and its record, particularly in the agriculture sectorâanother matter I will return to. For five years we've had lots of talk about the agriculture sector being the fifth pillar, I think it was, of our economy, but all we have is a failed white paper and a pedestrian response to drought, notwithstanding the fact that we have been alerting them to the issues for up to five years now, but I'll return to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the course of this week a number of people have announced that they're leaving this place at the next election, and it makes one think about the reason we are all here. I'm sure that without exception we are all here to make a difference, to make Australia a better place. Most of us arrive here having chosen a political party as our vehicle, and we choose the party which is most likely to achieve the things that drive us. You always have to be cautious about trying to summarise it, but I think it's fair to say that it's as simple as this: we're here to expand the economy; to make sure that everyone gets a fair share of the dividends of that growth; to ensure that every Australian, regardless of their background or economic position in life, has the best opportunity to capitalise on a strong Australian economy; and to give a hand up to those who slip through the cracks for whatever reasonâbe it prejudice, poverty, disability or any other form of disadvantage, we as a parliament are there to ensure that they too have an opportunity and to help them get there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After more than 30 years I still very firmly believeâin fact, I knowâthat I chose the right party in the Australian Labor Party. I have no regrets. I think it's fair to say that Labor's achievements in government have been many: in education and the expansion of higher education in particular to all Australians, not just those with the biggest credit cards; in workers' rights, one of the key reasons for our existence; in building social justice and equality; in correcting the wrongs of the past through our response to the Mabo case, for example, and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's apology to the stolen generationsâthe list goes on and on. In the eighties and nineties the Australian Labor Party opened up and made the Australian economy more competitive, putting us on a path to 27 years now, I think, of unbroken economic growth, building a resilience which allowed us to go through the global financial crisis without technically going into recession. They are big achievements, and all of us on this side are proud of them and like to talk about them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst those many achievements of the eighties and nineties was one that doesn't rate too many mentions and deserves to be mentioned far moreâthat is, under former minister John Kerin, the establishment of our current agriculture based research and development corporations. In all parts of our economy we can't hope to be competitive and to meet all our aspirations in future decades ahead if we haven't fully embraced and adopted research and innovation, and agriculture is no exception. What was somewhat unique around the world about the research and development corporation structure John Kerin put in place was its co-funding model. In other words, the government took the view that, to maximise effort, it was appropriate for taxpayers to match levy payer contributions under that research model up to a certain gross valueâI think it's 0.5 per centâof the sector involved. Back then, and still today, we have 15 agriculture based research and development corporations across the various commodities: Meat &amp; Livestock Australia in the red meat sector, Dairy Australia in the dairy sector, the Grains Research and Development Corporation in the grains sectorâthe list goes on. Four of those remain statutory research and development corporationsâin other words, tightly controlled by the government under legislationâand the balance of them, 11, are now industry-owned organisations. All of them do a wonderful job. The Kerin model lives on today and lives on very, very effectively. However, 30 or more years on, it's time to revisit that model to ensure that levy payer money and taxpayer money is being spent in the most efficient and effective way in each of those commodity sectors and in terms of the contribution they make to the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was certainly the view of the government of the day in 2011, when it commissioned a Productivity Commission report into the agriculture based rural research and development corporations. I have the report with me. It should be compulsory reading for anyone with an interest in the agriculture sector. It's a comprehensive report, and it identified back then that there were ways in which we could make that model even better, because obviously, over that considerable period of time since 1991, the economy and the world have changed so substantially. It could be taken as a criticism of the former Labor government that, having reported in 2011, we didn't embrace any of the changes recommended either, but I think most people would fairly appreciate that there was a very limited time between the tabling of this report and the September 2013 election. But this government has had five years to have a think about this report, and the only thing we've seen in terms of adjustment of that model are the measures that we're talking about today. Again, while I think they are important and Labor supports them, I hardly think they are revisiting in a full review the RDC system and how it operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes a number of changes that will ensure improvements to the collection and reporting of agricultural levies and charges to ensure better consistency between the legislation and industry changes. The bill also makes improvements to the effective operation of levy payer registers. I will focus on that point for a few moments. As I said, the last time the government attempted to get this bill through the parliament, I made the point that, surely, people listening to the debate would be surprised that levy payers, whether they be cattle producers or grain growers, pay their levies to the Australian government, which then passes them on to the relevant research and development corporation. But the part that would really surprise people is that the research and development corporations still don't know who their levy payers are. These are organisations which are focused on their commodity sector, and there are many of them. The 15 RDCs I mentioned strike 130 levies collected across 77 commodity sectors. They look at their sectors, and their job is to ensure that farmers, growers and producers have available to them the very best in research and innovation and that that innovation is getting inside the farm gate down on the ground where it really can make a difference. But RDCs don't know who their levy payers are, which I think is somewhat surprising, because if you don't know who they are, you're not necessarily well placed to have a proper dialogue with them. These amendments will allow that opportunity, but, more particularly, they are about making sure that that information isn't inappropriately shared with third parties, and that's the issue I raised on the last two occasions that I spoke to this bill. Hopefully, these amendments put in place the changes that provide the necessary protection. Data and information like that, as you know, is quite a valuable commodity these days, and our right not to have that information shared is very important as well. Again, while this is not a big change to the model, the changes will be important if they are properly implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I return to drought and, more generally, lost opportunities in the agriculture sector for the course of the past five years. I note that in the Prime Minister's speechâI think it was in his last speech and certainly in the Prime Minister's speech yesterdayâhe made reference again to this aspiration that Australian agriculture will be valued at $100 billion by 2030, I think it was. I think it's important to have aspirations and goals, whether they be exercise goalsâlosing weightâor whatever it might be. Goals can't hurt. But I think $100 billion is somewhat modest. I think we can do better than that, if we try harderâand we should strive to do better than that. In fact, $100 billion would just leave us on the same trajectory we've been on for the past 10 years, if you rely on the ABS stats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can do better than that, but it won't happen magically. It will require ongoing hard work by those who work in the production of our food and fibre. It will also require smart guidance from governmentâsomething that's been lacking over the course of the past five years. In fact, over the course of the past five years there has been no guidance. We waited very patiently for an agriculture white paper, and when it finally came it was a dud. That's something that I think is generally accepted in the agriculture sector now. You won't hear too many saying it publicly, but when you talk to the sector's leadership and to growers and producers on the ground, that's what they say all the time. Expectations were raised, and they were deflated as a result of that white paper. It's never referred to now. In fact, when the now Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, launched the latest document, spruiking the aspiration of $100 billion by 2030, I thought it was an admission on his part that the world had moved on, that the agriculture white paper was no longer of any use to the sector and that it would provide no guidance and provide nothing special to help us go beyond those aspirations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to drought: I talked already about how bad the drought is, and it is certainly very, very bad. Is there a role for government? Yes, there certainly is. Is there a limit to how much government can do? Yes, there certainly is. Governments can't make it rain. But there are important things for government to do. The first, of course, is to ensure that those who, for whatever reason, just haven't been able to manage the severity of the drought have an income support payment for them and their families when things get tough. You can prepare for some droughtsâmany droughts, very bad droughtsâbut you can't necessarily prepare for the worst of the droughts. And there will always be those who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to work their way through a protracted drought period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another important point to that. It's why, when the COAG ministers entered into an intergovernmental agreement in 2013, they said, 'Yes, there should be a welfare payment'âI shouldn't say 'welfare payment'; I meant to use the right description, which is income support paymentâ'but it should be limited,' so that people have three years to work their way through their situation. And if, through no fault of their own, they haven't been able to adjust sufficiently to make their farm enterprise viable, then it might be time to do something else and to liquidate their assets. The important part of that, of course, is that there were supposed to be other measures taking place, other guidance from government, throughout the five-year period of the intergovernmental agreement, which would have helped farmers build that resilience and that capacity to make the decision to stay. But that work hasn't been done.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what happens? The government takes the clumsy, lazy policy way out and says, 'Oh, we'll just extend it for another year.' Well, we support extending it for another year. The drought is very, very bad, and that support is desperately needed. But it's not a policy solution to an issue that we will continue to confront for decades to come. We have to accept that the climate is changing; it's becoming more challenging. Those on the other side want to argue about what is causing it. I'll let them go. Interestingly, Minister Littleproud said on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A </span>last Monday night that he didn't care what was causing it, which I thought was a curious approach. They can have that argument, but they should at least embrace the precautionary principle and accept that if there's a case to be made that human activity is causing the climate to change for the worst, we should act. So mitigation is step one. The second step is adaptation. If the majority of the scientists are right and the weather will only continue to get more challenging, we need to assist farmers to adjust to that situation.</span>

I won't dwell on the positive for too long, member for Dawson, because it won't take me long. There are two components to this.

                    </a>  The member for Dawson said he did. He's talking about the augmentation of Chaffey Dam, which was a Labor government initiative. It was all but finished when the now member for New England was elected in 2013. I say to the member for Dawson: who do you think you are talking to when you make these claims? If you are talking to the farmers and the people who live in New England, they know that is rubbish. It does your credibility no good telling porkies around the electorate and taking credit for projects you had no control over and can take no credit for.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government did do a few things. They improved accelerated depreciation for farmers on water infrastructure, smaller projects on the farm that might help them build resilience, and Labor supported those. In fact, our Australian investment guarantee now expands that proposition. And they made some adjustments to the farm management deposits scheme, which is a scheme that allows farmers to put money away in good times to draw down at a concessional tax rate in tougher times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should reflect there on Minister Littleproud, who has tried to make the focus of the drought debate his most recent changes to FMDs. That is, putting some pressure on the banks to provide offsets between the FMDs and their debt, and that's fine. But guess what, most of the farmers who are struggling don't have money in FMDs. It's axiomatic. They don't have money in FMDs, so don't make FMDs the focal point of your drought response, because it is not the answer. It's about as good an answer to building catchment dams, which is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem. The member for Dawson should know better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next thing is the way in which farmers approach their business model and, in particular, how they farm the land. This is not new. We've known for a long time that European farming methodsâthe overapplication of fertilisers and other methodsâhave been bad for our landscape. This is where we should never talk about farmers generically, because many, many farmers embrace the latest science based farming methods, but not sufficient are. This is the area where this government has done absolutely nothing in five years, and worse it abolished the COAG committee designed to progress it. We're now five years behind the times in what could become the worst drought we've faced. But it's not too late. It's not too late to accept that the climate will continue to change and become more challenging, and that we need to improve the uptake of adaptation and the embrace of the best and latest farming methodsâwhether it be cell grazing, whether it be the planting of trees, whether it be work on lifting the carbon levels and other organic matter levels in our soil so that we can retain more moisture in our soils. I say to the member for Dawson: we can retain more moisture, improving the carbon levels in our soils, than we can do building dams, and we can do it more cheaply, certainly more quickly, and certainly with less adverse impact on the environmentâcertainly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now go back to the first tranche: income support. We've been saying for 4Â½ years now that Farm Household Allowance is not working for many, many farmers. In fact, my colleagues will recall my asking the member for New England a question on this in this place back in 2014, because we were very concerned it wasn't working, that it wasn't reaching farmers. And what did he do? He embellished. He deliberately gave an incorrect answer and then decided to doctor his <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, which led, very sadly, to the dismissal of his departmental secretary, because his departmental secretary had the temerity to challenge the minister, because he was drawing his professional and dedicated public service into the mire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key point here is that we've been saying this for more than four years, and it still isn't getting fixed. We welcome the change to the assets test and we welcome the supplementary payment for those already on Farm Household Allowance. But we have seen little sign that it's going to be any easier to secure Farm Household Allowance. The big black hole of Centrelink and the paperwork appear to be very much still in place. That model has not changed. Until it does, farmers and farming families will continue to struggle to secure it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a debate about our research and development corporations. I have challenged the government to return to the COAG model and to work out how we get a better uptake of the best and latest science based farming methods. We have reflected on this for a long time, because it is hard to get more innovation rolled out onto the farmsâthere are at least 80,000 of them and they are spread geographically across the continent. There are organisations that are already doing it to an extent, and they are called our research and development corporations. The grain growers have their GrowNotesâthe messages that go out to the growers on the latest and the best information, whether it be on genetics or soil health. MLA does something similar. Dairy Australia does these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's nowhere near enough, and that's why I announced a fortnight or so ago that a Labor government would better-utilise the research and development corporations. We would ask them to come together through the Council of Rural Research and Development Corporations and lead and mobilise a much greater effort, both on furthering the science but more particularly on getting the innovation down onto the farm. They have the resources, they have the people, they have the experience, and, as we were talking about today, through the levy system they have this special relationship with growers and producers. In my view, all they need is some guidance from government. It is not that difficult. But if they are going to do it most effectively, we need to ensure that the more than $300 million of taxpayers' money they receive to do this work is being spent most effectively and most efficiently. That also goes for the money that comes from levy payers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we need a broader review of our research and development corporations. It is not to give them less moneyâno, no, no. It is to make sure that the money they receive from both the taxpayers and the levy payers is spent in the best possible way, producing the best possible outcome for both our growers and producers and also for the Australian economy and the Australian people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to get to my feet today to talk about the shadow minister's second reading amendment. It is an important amendment to this bill, because, if you turn on the television anywhere in Australia today, it's drought-affected New South Wales and Queensland that are right there in full view. This country arguably has never seen a worse drought. Thousands and thousands of families are affected by it. Millions of Australians have responded with donations, as is the Australian way. We've seen convoys of hay and feed making their way to these drought-stricken farmers. This parliament has a duty to do all that it can to ensure that farmers in regional communities are supported in their time of need, so it's disappointing that the bill before the House today fails to ensure the collection of levies and charges that are directed to our agriculture-based research and development corporations, enabling a greater effort to improve the take-up of the best and latest farm management practices, particularly in light of the current drought crisis. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get serious as a nation about encouraging farmers to employ the best and latest farm management practices. That includesâit must includeâa focus on climate change, which arguably poses the greatest threat to farming in Australia today. I note the member for Dawson interjected earlier, saying, 'Stop it? How are you going to stop climate change?'</span>

                    </a>  He should. We don't pretend to be godlike on this side of the House. We don't think we can stand in the way of climate change. I think that time has passed. All the scientific evidence is that climate change is upon us. It's not something in the future; it's upon us now. We need to manage its impact as best we can. Climate change is affecting farmers right now. You talk to farmers. They know these changes are not just part of the cyclical weather patterns that we see from season to season. These are permanent changes to the climate. The climate in Australia is getter drier and it's getter hotter. You talk to firefighters who go out every day during summer to fight blazes, and they'll tell you: the fires are hotter and more frequent than they used to be. And the firefighters are not going out just in summer anymore; they're going out all through the year. So we need to address climate change. It's not some sort of voodoo science, some sort of conspiracy of the Left against those on the Right; it's a scientific fact. Ninety-seven or 98 per cent of climate scientists in the world agree. It is real. You need to face up to the fact that climate change is real. It's impacting farmers and it's impacting agriculture in this country, and, unless we face up to this reality, we're going to be behind the eight ball every day of the week. I wanted to get to my feet to briefly discuss that, because I think this second reading amendment is very important in addressing this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a piece in The Conversation last year titled 'Australian farmers are adapting to climate change'. This is true. We on this side of the House have had briefings from farmers who want policymakers in this place to get serious about climate change as it pertains to agricultural policy. They don't see this as some sort of inner-city issue; they know that climate change is affecting them on the land. Rising temperatures caused global wheat yields to drop by around 5.5 per cent between 1980 and 2008, and the effects in Australia have been larger, as a result of major changes in rain patterns. Talk to farmers in New South Wales and Queensland. It's winter. The paddocks are normally green this time of year. There's dustâdust in the middle of winter! You can't bury your head in the sand on this issue. You can't say that you care about farmers, that you care about the impacts of and addressing drought, unless you're serious about addressing climate change. They go hand in hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does support the bill. We think it needs to go further. I think this government's most, not famous, but most well-known contribution to agriculture policy to date has been the release of the member for New England's book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Weatherboard and I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ron</span>. That's perhaps what most people would associate with agriculture policy from this government. Certainly the white paper on agriculture came and went with nary a whisper. I think they were too embarrassed by that document. On that note I will conclude. I thank the House.</span>

The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2018 will improve the collection and reporting of agricultural levies by allowing the acts of intermediaries to be clarified under the legislation. The bill further supports the operation of levy payer registers, including by protecting the privacy of levy payer details. It allows the secretary to impose conditions on an approval to disclose levy payer information to third parties. It allows revocation of an approval if conditions are breached and permits reconsideration and review of such decisions. It also provides for the collection of commodity-specific information if needed for levy payer registers. The amendments also allow the publication of statistical information about levies and charges to allow primary industries to make informed decisions about their levies. An efficient and effective levy system will support producers in managing their levy investments for profitable, sustainable industries. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

While this government is cutting health spending and education spending, it wants to give $80 billion in corporate tax giveaways to the biggest firms, including $17 billion to the big banks. When we look at multinational profit shifting, we have a government that is defending tax havens at every turn, that is defending tax-shifting behaviour, that is unwilling to crack down on the debt deduction loophole that is currently allowing multinationals to shift profits offshore.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Yesterday, the government moved forward with its ridiculous plan to make life harder for prospective university students and graduates. At a time when our economic future depends on a smarter, better trained workforce, at a time when we should be working to reduce inequality and to improve access to education, this government has decided to whack low-income Australians. While it remains committed to giving away $17 billion to profitable banks and multinationals, it's put the squeeze on younger Australians and people who are seeking to retrain in the face of a changing jobs environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When HECS was introduced in 1990, the repayment threshold was $22,000. That was 73 per cent of average male earnings at the time. Now this Turnbull government has decided to drop the current threshold from $55,000 to $45,000, which is less than 60 per cent of average earnings. This change will likely have a particular effect, a particular impact, on women, who are already disadvantaged by the gender pay gap and who, in the case of single mums, will be dealing with a combined sharp impact of marginal tax rates and reduction in family support. That means that some women will know that, if they earn one dollar more than $45,000, they will instantly be worse off.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  One of the most important principles that underpin our criminal justice system is that, no matter the allegation brought against one of us, we are all considered innocent until proven guilty. It is our front line in defence against authoritarian government and against the lynch mob. This week, some elements in the media and some social commentators have thrown that principle away without a thought in their haste to tear down those who defend our nation in the most difficult of circumstances. With no idea of those circumstances, no experience of the fog of war and total disregard for the legal process that protects them, our armchair warriors and self-appointed judges have condemned a man with a proven track record of selfless bravery. We know without a doubt that Ben Roberts-Smith has saved lives and displayed the most conspicuous gallantry in defence of his country. Unless and until he or any of his mates are proven guilty, those who condemn them without facts or any comprehension of war should think hard about what they have done and consider the consequences not only of trying to undermine the service men and women who put their lives on the line for our country but of abandoning our most precious legal principle.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Once again the Turnbull government has shown that it can't manage to roll out a straightforward program, with its bungling of the My Health Record opt-out proposal. Through its incompetence, the government has managed to turn what should have been a widely supported program into a much-criticised initiative that has lost the confidence of the Australian people. Even the government's own supporters have criticised the rollout. For those people who wanted to opt out, the process was equally frustrating.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's track record of failures has caused considerable criticism and loss of faith in governments. In recent times, the Turnbull government has presided over debacles with the National Broadband Network rollout, the National Disability Insurance Scheme rollout, the 2016 census, its robo-debt mess and now its My Health Record.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The My Health Record proposal is an important national initiative. It's in the public interest. It's in the government's interest. The Turnbull government should now support Labor's suggestion to refer the My Health Record system to a Senate committee, listen to the many concerns that have arisen about the government's implementation, fix the problem and get a sensible initiative back on track.</span>

This is why earlier this year we launched our local roads petition and began working with all levels of government to fight for much needed road upgrades. We heard from people like Ken, in Lushington Street at East Gosford. We heard from residents in Saratoga about their safety concerns on Steyne Road, and we heard from hundreds of residents in Empire Bay about the need for upgrades to Greenfield Road.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in March we held a community catch-up in Empire Bay, and over the weekend we held another listening post there. Dozens of local residents from Empire Bay and Bensville joined us on the foreshore for a cup of tea and a chat, and we continued this conversation. Sally Anne shared her safety concerns regarding young kids riding on scooters and bikes on already unsafe roads. Lynette from Greenfield Road told me that the issues include major potholes, excessive speeds and difficulties backing out from driveways. Certainly, on behalf of Lynette and others on Greenfield Road, I'll be fighting for an upgrade of this particularly important road in Empire Bay. I also heard from locals like John from the Bensville Residents Group, who said that Kallaroo Road in Bensville was a major safety concern for residents. And it was great to be joined by my state colleague, Adam Crouch; Taylor Martin; Mayor Jane Smith and Councillor Rebecca Gail Collins. Thank you for your continued support and advocacy on the important issue of upgrading local roads in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Last Friday it was my honour to be at the farewell for Giuseppe Fin, or Joe Fin, as he was known, one of the founders of CO.AS.IT, the Italian welfare organisation in Australia. The farewell at St Fiacre's Catholic Church in Leichhardt was, of course, packed. Without doubt, he was probably the most significant leader of the Italian community in Sydney over the last century. He and his wife, Patriciaâshe was an organist at St Fiacre's way back, many decades agoâraised eight children; many, many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. They were all there to farewell this great community leader.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He'd been active in the Catholic Church in Italy before migrating to Australia in 1956. He, through CO.AS.IT, founded a bilingual school, which is now a very successful Sydney institution. He moved into aged care, into welfare, into providing services for people who'd migrated to this country, and CO.AS.IT became a national organisation. To all of Joe's many friends as well as his family and the Italian community of Sydney, I pay tribute to his great contribution.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I know that the member for Durack, here today, will also welcome two significant backflips by the Western Australian government: firstly, the reinstatement of the funding for the Community Resource Centres, which are an integral part of our rural communities, and, secondly, the installation of a SMART drum line trial. While I welcome that announcement of the WA government's drum line trial in the south-west, I'm disappointed that the town of Esperance, in my electorate of O'Connor, has not been included in this strategy. In recent months I've pushed hard for the state government to implement SMART drum lines off the Esperance coast to protect people from potential shark attacks. Esperance, an ocean-loving community which attracts more than 230,000 visitors a year, is currently living in fear and trepidation due to increased shark sightings that have resulted in numerous attacks and one fatality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragic death of 17-year-old Laeticia Brouwer in April 2017 was the straw that finally saw the Esperance community fight back. It prompted local schoolteacher and surfer Mitch Capelli to start the Esperance Ocean Safety and Support Group. I joined one of his forums and committed to help making the ocean safer. Despite highlighting shark dangers, Esperance has seen no support from the state government and is now facing the countdown to October, an especially dangerous month to be in Esperance's waters. They're frustrated and angry that their call for protection has not been acted on. I therefore call upon the government of Western Australia to do the right thing and protect the people of my electorate by extending its SMART drum line trial to Esperance.</span>

I receive feedback each and every day from constituents who long to see a government that will advocate for their interests and better their lives. Instead they have to deal with an out-of-touch Prime Minister whose only focus appears to be handing out $80 billion to the banks and to big business. Macarthur residents want to see their schools properly funded and their children receive a first-class education. Macarthur residents deserve and want to see real action to see an end to the rising cost-of-living pressures. That's why I'm advocating, along with my colleagues, for bigger and fairer tax cuts for my hardworking constituency. Macarthur residents want to see their public hospitals properly funded, and they want to see proper funding not only for education and hospitals but also for transport infrastructure such as the Western Sydney Airport rail, which is not being funded properly by the federal and state Liberal governments.</span>

It is a disgrace, and it's time for it to end. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Firbank's All Stars program is ensuring all of our community live a healthy and productive lifestyle. The program was inspired by Sam, a young boy with cerebral palsy, who captivated his swimming coaches after 18 months with a can-do attitude. We should celebrate the willingness of Sam, Lola, Archie, Grace, Tilly, Jamal, Louis, Andrew, Harry, Ruby, Mitchell, Caleb, Isabelle, Lochie and Jesse. Well done and keep going, because we're proud of you and your support for and participation in this program. Thank you also to the Firbank girls for volunteering their time to assist: Charlotte, Lucy, Marlo, Zoe, Cara, Flossy, Summer, Anna, Skye and Alice. Particular thanks go to Lucy Weddell and Peter Russo, who are the architects of this program.</span>

The hospital has increased its take-up by five per cent, to 4,000 patients admitted per year. That's fantastic when the local population of Mansfield itself is only 3,000. So today I give a real call-out to the CEO, Cameron Butler; the director of clinical services, Margaretanne Hood; the board chairman, Phillip Officer; the 210 permanent full-time staff who manage the three urgent care beds and the 72 aged-care beds; and the volunteer hospital auxiliary, led by Anne Mudge, which last year raised $76,000 to provide equipment. The hospital also has two associated clinical practices, which employ 13 doctors and associated staff. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been really blessed this week to have three volunteers working in my office. I've got Rhonda here, sitting in the advisory desk, and Maz Dowling, who helped me with this particular speech. I'd like to do a call-out to give a sense of what makes my electorate so special. It's community people getting behind their health services, coming to Canberra, learning how things work, helping write speeches and then taking the message back to their community that show that democracy is alive and well in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Over the parliamentary winter recess, I received the best news I've heard since the budget in May. The $225 million I secured via the federal government through my advocacy to fund the electrification and duplication of Metro rail from Frankston to Baxter will be matched by an elected Matthew Guy Victorian Liberal government. A total of $453 million has now been dedicated to the biggest infrastructure project in Dunkley's history. It will help free up parking at Frankston, Kananook, Seaford and Carrum, create 4,000 local jobs, reduce congestion and more. So far it means a new station at Langwarrin and service for the hospital and the university at Frankston East, as well as an upgraded station at Baxter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to Michael Lamb, the Liberal candidate for Frankston; Donna Bauer, the Liberal candidate for Carrum; and Neale Burgess, the member for Hastings, for their wonderful efforts at the state level to secure this state match in funding from an elected Liberal government in Victoria. Recently we also had the privilege of being told that the shadow infrastructure minister has copied our leadership and won't withdraw the $225 million of Turnbull coalition funding if electedâand I say 'privilege' with genuine enthusiasm, given their state counterpart's history with the East West Link contracts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, it is now time for the Andrews Labor government to step up to the plate with matching funding, because the only risk to this project is a Victorian Labor government being elected. They have dragged their feet on this issue. They need to step up, and they also need to step up to save the 200 jobs and seven businesses in Seaford. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Last week was Early Learning Matters Week, and I was horrified that the Turnbull government chose that week to confirm it is refusing to commit to funding the national kindergarten program. It's clear that they intend to walk away from 350 kinder kids who rely on this program and cut $440 million from the sector, a year after the next election is due. Of all the cuts the Liberals have made over the last five years, surely this is one of the worst and the most cynical. This is on top of the damaging childcare subsidy changes, which affect those who can least afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government simply do not get how important early childhood learning is. We on this side of the House get it, and I especially do. My twin girls actually failed kindergarten! It was their early childhood educator who identified that they weren't ready to go on to school and would benefit greatly from another year at kinder. I'm eternally grateful for that early childhood educator, and I hate to think what might have been. Despite the fact that my girls get teased mercilessly about this, they went on to do very well at school. My kids went to kinder in our local areaâClyde Street kinder, actuallyâand it gave them social and education skills to get them school-ready. All kids deserve this opportunity, especially disadvantaged kids, as early education means that their future holds more opportunities and choices. The government must do better. I want to thank all the amazing early childhood educators in our community and say that yes, early learning matters. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The club was chartered on 16 August 1928, and on Thursday night it will mark its nine decades of achievement. The Rotary Club of North Sydney has been an incredible part of our local community and one of the strongest clubs in the Rotary movement. Over the years it has been involved in hundreds of projectsâtoo many to mention in their entirety today, but, to give a glimpse: the club has provided for the needy during the Great Depression, assisted those who suffered during World War II, run a program to take disadvantaged children to Sydney's Luna Park during the 1950s and '60s, organised a major air show in 1969 to raise funds for local charities, funded 40 water wells in India, provided training for Timor-Leste teachers, donated minibuses for local community and health centres, managed the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal in North Sydney, contributed to Rotary International's incredible work to eliminate polio globally, and during its life has distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to various charities both in Australia and overseas.</span>

While I jumped ship to the North Sydney Sunrise club, I know that the club continues to be a vibrant force within Rotary. I extend my best wishes to the current president, Ross Waugh, and wish them well for what will be a worthy celebration on Thursday night. I hope they'll have a drink for me! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The ABC consistently is rated as the most trustworthy news source for Australians, with over 17 million Australians consuming some sort of ABC content each and every week. However, in recent times we've seen the foundations of the ABC come under consistent attack from this government, who are determined to cut and cut the very institution upon which so many Australians rely. Since 2014 we've seen the Turnbull government cut $282 million from the ABC, with 800 jobs lost and a drop in Australian content and services.</span>

As in many communities across Australia, we heard from residents who said the ABC was their go-to choice for news and entertainment. Our local community and millions of Australians are sick and tired of the continued attacks on the ABC by the Turnbull government. The ABC is for all Australians across metropolitan, regional and rural Australia. We must protect and strengthen it. Now more than ever Australians need the ABC, our strong, trusted and independent public broadcaster. My message to the Turnbull government today is clear: hands off our ABC.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I rise to address the House about the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, in our education system. In Australia we enjoy a very high standard of living that has been made possible by the hard work of generations past, but if we are to continue enjoying this standard of living, we must be ready and able to innovate and grow. That can only occur if we provide high-quality STEM education to our younger generations and afford them opportunities to develop their problem-solving and lateral thinking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago I launched the Bennelong STEM challenge, which is a program available for all 42 schools in our electorate to participate in. This year we have partnered with the excellent Re-Engineering Australia Foundation, which creates STEM challenges for schools all around the country. This year's task is for teams to design a medical centre for the surface of Mars using 3D design softwareâa fitting theme, given the recent announcement of the formation of the Australian Space Agency. This will give teams ample opportunity to partner imaginative design with technological skills and explore all that STEM has to offer. The competing teams will present their designs at a competition day, which will be held in late September and has been generously supported by Medtronic, who will be hosting the teams at their office in Macquarie Park. The competition has been very well-received by numerous schools, and we very much look forward to seeing what the teams come up with for outer space.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Last week the Darwin Cup Carnival culminated in its signature event, the 2018 Darwin Cup. It was a great day with over 20,000 people making their way down to the Darwin Turf Club at Fannie Bay. The main race of the day, the Darwin Cup, was won by Zahspeed, trained by local trainer Gary Clarke, and first-time entrant Olivia Campbell was the winner of this year's Fashions on the Field. Sadly there wasn't a competition for the best mullet; nonetheless I did see a couple around the track.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gee-gees weren't the only major sporting event in town last week, with Darwin hosting the Western Sydney Wanderers as they took on our local club, Hellenic, in the FFA Cup. It was a cracker of a game. The Wanderers from down south went up two nil earlyâin the first 10 minutes, in factâbut then our local club, Hellenic, pegged them back to three all. I think it was in added time that Hellenic was robbed of a penalty when the scores were level at three all, and unfortunately the Wanderers just got ahead. However, congratulations to all the Hellenic players and everyone involved with the club, especially the goalscorers, Daniel Smith and Sulav Maskey; the head coaches, Pedro Stefanidakis and John Tsaknis; and the president, Kosta Boubaris. Well done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I commend the Manningham Parkinson's Peer Support Group, which I had the pleasure of visiting just recently. I thank Keith and Margaret Anderson, who are involved in the peer support group. They're also very involved in Rotary Club of Templestowe and St Mark's Anglican Church. It's estimated that one in 308 Australians are living with Parkinson's disease and that about 37 new cases are diagnosed every day. That's some 13,500 new cases that will be diagnosed this year. Of the 82,000 Australians estimated to be living with Parkinson's, about 18 per centâalmost one in fiveâare of working age; however, the prevalence does increase with age. For persons 65 and over there's a prevalence of one in a thousand, but by the time people reach 75 or over the prevalence comes down to one in a hundred. This disease is global, worldwide and increasing in prevalence. Whilst Parkinson's in itself is not life-threatening, it's clearly life altering, with shaking, slowness of movement and muscle stiffness being amongst the most obvious of the symptoms. I commend the group that meets in Bulleen, Parkinson's groups right around Australia and Parkinson's Australia in Victoria for the work they're doing for people in this situation.</span>

Ms King was there to announce that, under a Labor government, the Werribee Mercy will have a fully rebated MRI licence. This is fantastic news for our local community, because we've had people travelling to Sunshine, to Geelong, to the City of Melbourne, to access a fully rebated MRI. We've had people paying $400 in out-of-pocket expenses. We've had our local hospital put patients, inpatients, in ambulances to go to access an MRI. </span>

I stand here today to ask the Minister for Health, Minister Hunt, if he would care to make an announcement about something new, something that isn't a saving in the budget, that isn't something that the PBAC has approved that is bipartisan. I ask Mr Hunt, 'Could you match this, please, Minister Hunt?' My hospital needs this now, and you can give us a fully rebated MRI licence today, if you have a mind to.</span>

Under the superb leadership of Principal Greg Paine and the assistant principals, Vicki Martin and Tania Hunter, the school has a wonderful atmosphere and culture of learning which is palpable as soon as you walk in the school. This time I visited Mount Waverley Primary as part of the CSIRO's hosting of the STEM in Schools event and in recognition of National Science Week. It was wonderful to be warmly greeted by our future leaders, school captains Thisumi and Matthew, and other school leaders, some of whom took lots of photos.</span>

Technology is advancing more rapidly than at any other time in history, providing humanity with new opportunities and new ways to solve old problems. The students, staff and community at Mount Waverley Primary energetically participated in CSIRO's STEM in Schools event. It was heartwarming to see these children embracing STEM learning skills, gaining confidence, and constructively enjoying the creative and learning experience with such enthusiasm. As the nature of work changes, it is more important than ever that students participate and engage in STEM subjects in Australia. </span>

I am so proud to be the representative of such a wonderful school.</span>

It was a meeting that might have set out Australia's future, the sort of country we're going to leave for our grandchildren. Rumour has it that there were some contrary voices coalescing around the member for Warringah; however, at the barbecue for the Australian head of state that I'm talking about, this was not raised. I'd like to acknowledge the member for Mackellar, the member for Kingsford Smith, and Senator Richard Di Natale, who organised this barbecue for an Australian head of state. It was well supported by Senator Singh. Many others turned up to support the idea of us having an Australian head of state. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been handing out portraits of our head of state to many people recently, including to some republicans, young republicans, who, when I asked about why they were there to get the portrait, said they did want an Australian head of state. Surely it's time for the Prime Minister to dig out those playing boots from 1999 for one last season, one last chance to have a crack at getting an Australian head of state. Surely we can't ever reconcile our past until we are truly confident about our identity and our maturity as an independent nation, and have an Australian head of state. As Peter FitzSimons said: it's time. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  One of the first roles of the Australian parliament is the security of its people. In a recent incident, on 16 July, a young family, 15 kilometres from Swan Hill, who were on the New South Wales side of the river, had an intruder in their home at 11 o'clock at night. The woman had to lock herself in the room with her three screaming children. Her husband had to call a neighbour to wrestle this offender, because the Victorian police were unable to go across the river; they had no jurisdiction in New South Wales. We have a situation where Victorian police can be 'constablised' to give them authority, but, because we have a lot of junior officers in our border towns, they are not constablised and able to cross over to the other side of the river.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I met with the Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security, Angus Taylor, and we are pushing very strongly for some federal jurisdiction to allow Victoria Police to cross over and protect citizens when they're on the other side of the river and to allow the New South Wales Police Force to cross over into Victoria. I think it is an anomaly that we have people who aren't able to be protected when their closest police officer is less than 15 kilometres away.</span>

Ironically, when the police came they put him in an ambulance and carted him back over to Victoria to the Victorian hospital, because he had cut his feet. This is more stuff we should be doing to protect the Australian people and our government is committed to it.</span>

I wonder how he feels about his leaders denigrating the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project. It's going to provide thousands of jobs in his electorate. The Leader of the Opposition described it as a vanity project, and sought to make fun of it. It is a gigantic project that is transforming the prospects of the communities the honourable member seeks to represent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the honourable member raises coal-fired power and compares it with hydro. I saw that the member for Port Adelaide was out there today talking about renewables and how they were better than coal-fired power. The reality is the Labor Party can have its debates about one technology or another but what we're in favour of is cheaper electricity. That's our commitment: cheaper electricity. The market will work out what the cheaper model is. It may that hydro will be cheaper than a new coal-fired power station. Time will tell, but the bottom line is: let the market compete and that is what the National Energy Guarantee does.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time has come for the Labor Party to get real about the energy challenge having made so many poor decisions; having created the environment in South Australia where one minute a massive wind resource generates over 100 per cent of the state's demand and the next minute none; and where the member for Port Adelaide lives in a state where, thanks to the ideology and idiocy of the Labor Party, you have the most expensive and the least reliable energy in Australia. As Rod Sims, chairman of the ACCC, said just today, the time has come to stop 'subsidising one technology or another'. He said to prioritise affordability and ensure that you have a level playing field that delivers all the dispatchable power you need and will deliver the reliability and the cheaper electricity that Australians want.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition wrote to me last year and called for bipartisanship and cooperation on energy. The National Energy Guarantee is there. It's time now. It's designed by the experts. It will deliver cheaper electricity. It's now time for the Labor Party to support it and to stand up for Australian families who have been paying too much for power for too long.</span>

The government wants Australians to keep more of the money they earn. We want to encourage the enterprise andâmystery, though it may be to the member for Sydney!âthe aspiration of hardworking Australians through lower taxes and policies that back small and medium business. Labor, on the other hand, doesn't believe in aspiration. It's a mystery, according to their deputy leader, and that's why they're happy to increase taxes by over $200 billion, even to the extent of going after the savings of pensioners and retirees.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leader says this is fair. He thinks that increasing taxes on every small and medium business in Australia is fair. He thinks denying working Australians tax relief is fair. He thinks refusing to deal with bracket creep, meaning that Australians pay higher and higher taxes as they earn more, is fair. And he has no issue, of course, with Australians paying more for their energy because of his reckless targets. Because of the policies we've delivered, the government can afford to deliver personal income tax relief so that low- and middle-income earners save up to $530 a year this year and so that, when the full reform is complete in 2024, 94 per cent of Australians will face a marginal tax rate of no more than 32Â½c on additional money they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can reform to reduce taxes for small and medium businesses with turnovers up to $50 million because we know that will grow the economy and deliver stronger revenues to guarantee essential services. That's why we're able to spend more on hospitals, schools and infrastructure. Labor wants to increase taxes on all those businesses, and that can have only one result: less investment, less employment and lower wages. And we're doing everything we can, pulling every lever, to reduce the cost of energy. We hauled in the electricity retailers to ensure that households are getting the best deal on their electricity bill, saving families hundreds of dollars a year. We've ensured gas producers are prioritising Australian customers and Australian consumers over export markets. With a reform passed in this parliament, we've stopped the owners of the poles and wires from being able to game the systemâa practice that in the past has added billions of dollars in costs. Now, through the National Energy Guarantee, we're going to fix the national energy market so that Australians are paying less for their energy. The market has been broken by ideology and idiocy; the National Energy Guarantee is the means to resolve it.</span>

People who work in coal-fired power stations, according to the Leader of the Opposition, are involved in a shameful business. The Leader of the Opposition has got to get out of this ideological trap set for him by the Greens and get on the side of hardworking Australian families and ensure they have lower power bills.</span>

You'll see plenty of different technologies competing to receive that support, and you know what? I'll tell you whose side we're on. We're on the side of Australian families. They want to pay less for electricity, and we are the only parties in this parliament that have a plan for them to do so.</span>

I am aware of a high-taxing alternative put forward by the Labor Party. But, in our budget this year, we set out a plan for a stronger economy, and that plan was based on ensuring that all Australians who were having a go were going to get a fair go, and the way they were going to get that fair go was by ensuring that they got to keep more of the money they themselves earned. And that plan is working. That plan for a stronger economy is working: 95,200 young people got a job in 2017-18. That is the strongest fiscal year growth in youth employment in 30 yearsâsince before Taylor Swift was born! That's how far you've got to go back for a better year of fiscal growth in youth employment in this country. The Labor Party may want to 'shake that off', but we're not going to 'shake it off', because we know a plan for a stronger economy is what Australians need, and the way you deliver that for them is by backing them in. We're backing them in with lower taxes and we're backing them in with plans for lower electricity prices, for cheaper electricity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten million Australians are benefiting from our legislated personal tax plan. For a dual-income family on modest earnings, that's over $1,000 extra a year, and that's about half of their annual electricity bill. But there's more to come, with policies that are putting further downward pressure on electricity prices, and our tax plan that reaches out over the next eight years to ensure that all Australians who are working hard and paying tax can get that tax relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing about our plan is that it doesn't accept the Labor Party view, which is that, to help someone, to give someone a fair go, you've got to attack someone elseâjust like they seek to do on business and they seek to do through personal taxes as well. Our plan for lower taxes for all working Australians rejects the Labor Party's politics of envy. Their politics of envy have led them to seek to put $200 billion and more in higher taxes on the Australian economyâtaxes on housing, on investment, on savings, on wages, on small businesses and on family businesses; and taxes on retirees to the tune of around $5 billion a year. It is a tax plan from the Labor Party that is dripping with envy, and it will drain away the Australian economy if the Labor Party ever get their chance to take that huge burden of tax and throw it on the Australian economy. Under Labor, Australians will pay too much tax, way too much tax, for one simple reason: Labor cannot control their spending and, as a result, they will put $200 billion and more on the Australian economy.

Why does every single member over there, including the member for Hunter, want to turn the lights off on coal-fired power stations all around the country? Coal-fired power stations remain an important part of Australia's affordable, reliable energy supply, so why does the Labor Party want to shut them down and increase the energy costs for households and for businesses?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's plan on electricity is to put prices up. They want to increase the emissions reduction target to 45 per cent, which will increase power bills for Australians by about $190. That's what the leader of the Labor Party wants to do with people's power bills. What the Labor Party want to do with power bills for businesses is force their business prices up, because they have no plan to deliver affordable, reliable energy. On this side of the House, we have a plan which involves the National Energy Guarantee. We have a plan that has delivered on securing gas supplies for Australia. We have a plan that has delivered on removing the legal loopholes which were being used to drive up power prices. We had a plan to get rid of the carbon tax, and we got rid of the carbon taxâthe one that you said you would never introduce. And that's exactly what they did. When it comes to electricity prices, you can't trust Labor. Under Labor, you will always pay more for everything. </span>

Prime Minister, there has been a meningococcal outbreak in Tasmania, with six cases, one fatal. These infections are preventable. But currently the Commonwealth limits funding for the ACWY vaccine and doesn't fund the B vaccine at all. Prime Minister, will you fix this and fully fund both vaccines so that everyone, not just the wealthy, can be protected against this horrid disease? Please, Prime Minister, will you meet personally with Erica Burleigh, who was left legally blind by meningococcal B and who is in the gallery today? She and her friend Kacee Johnstone are the driving force behind a campaign for the B vaccine to be put on the National Immunisation Program Schedule. </span>

I want to assure the honourable member that the government makes decisions on vaccines based on the advice of the independent experts.

We're working with vaccine manufacturers towards a vaccine program that would apply for adolescents. Now, since April, we've been negotiating with a sponsor to make this vaccine broadly available in accordance with the recommendations of the experts. It's a very important step to make sure that vaccines meet the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee's, rightly strict cost-effectiveness criteria. The advisory committee also considered another brand for meningococcal ACWY last month, and we await the outcome on that. </span>

Under section 101 of the National Health Act, the government is not able to include a new medicine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or a vaccine on the National Immunisation Program unless it has first been recommended by the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. They are legal requirements, which enshrine the primacy of an expert medical recommendation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I remind the honourable member that, unlike the Labor Party, the government can guarantee that, if the medical experts on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommend meningococcal B vaccine, we'll list it on the National Immunisation Program. If the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommends it, we will list it. We won't defer it, as happened under the Labor government. So we're urging the sponsor company to resubmit their application at the earliest opportunity, with more evidence on the vaccine's effectiveness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All governments, Commonwealth and state, have responsibility for national immunisation coverage. States rightly play a critical role in ensuring state based vaccination programs are in place to help protect the wider community from the spread of disease. Across the country, states are administering the ACWY vaccine programs for at-risk cohorts, from school based programs for adolescents to the free vaccination clinics set up in Tasmania this month. I can assure the honourable member that weâand I know all honourable members will understand the importance of thisâall will remain vigilant and proactive in our joint efforts to combat the spread of these preventable diseases and keep our community safe.</span>

We back jobs: jobs in agriculture and jobs in Central Queensland. I know the members for Flynn, Dawson and Capricornia and all of the LNP members and indeed all of the members on this side back jobs. We want vibrant country communities with good local, long-term jobs now and into the future. We want to help ensure that hardworking Australians get reward for their effort.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure that power is reliable. The member for Flynn understands this and so does everyone on this side of the House. It starts with securing affordable, reliable power for all Australians. We understand that power prices put a strain on households and on business budgets. We're taking action to make the system more reliable and more secure and to put downward pressure on power prices. They will go down.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a business in the member's electorate, Zimmermann Farming at Jambin, and I need to talk about farming, because we believe in the future of Central Queensland. We believe in farmers, and when farmers are going well so too is our nation. Mick Zimmermann is a lucerne producer. He wants to take the opportunity to help our drought-stricken farmers. We're certainly getting on board, and I know all of the parliament wants us to help our drought-stricken farmers. That's why we've changed the farm household assistance measures, that's why we have put in mental health relief and that's why we've put in more rural financial counsellorsâit is so they can sit around the kitchen table with farmers and their partners. We don't, as the member for Hunter suggested last week, want to tell farmers how they can farm and where they can farm. We want farmers to have their own destiny.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hunter should listen more to the member for Paterson, who last week spoke glowingly about coal, and he should listen less to the member for Shortland. They should pay more attention to the member for Paterson, who said there was a future for coal in this country. But there's also a future for jobs and for lower power prices, which comes with the National Energy Guarantee. Mick Zimmermann is a fantastic bloke. He wants to produce more lucerne, but he said he is scared to irrigate because of the cost of electricity. Two years ago his electricity bill was $3,500 per month. It's now $11,000 and he's doing half as much irrigating. Small businesses such as these cannot afford Labor's South Australian experiment. The member for Port Adelaide over there described it as a hiccup. It's not a hiccup; it is what we will have. The blackouts will continue if the member for Maribyrnong ever becomes Prime Minister.</span>

What I'm surprised by is that the shadow Treasurer has no clue at all about energy policy. He has no idea that if you build a new HELE plant then the cost of it and capitalising it means that the cost of it is going to be higher than an existing plant right now. It's simple economics. I recommend to the member that he actually read up a bit on this topic, because we haven't heard from him much on energy policy. What we've heard a lot about from the member for McMahon is higher taxes. That's what we've heard about from the member for McMahon. All we hear about from the member for McMahon is not how to get electricity prices down but how to put people's taxes up. And we learnt just recently why he wants to put taxes up so much, because the member for Rankin belled the cat. He has said that he's going to abolish the staffing limits in the public service, so higher taxes for more desks in Canberraânot more desks in schools, but more desks in public service offices right here in Canberra; higher taxes for more public servants. And then he had this other brainwaveâhe's going to abolish the efficiency dividend to increase efficiency.</span>

He is committed to driving down power bills for Australian families in the electorate of Wright, across Queensland and across the country. Indeed, with his support today, and our colleagues, the National Energy Guarantee is one step closer, and it will help drive down Australian families' power bills by $550 and even more so for businesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time that the Leader of the Opposition stopped whispering sweet nothings into the ears of Australian families and got behind the policy which will deliver lower power prices for Australians. And that is the National Energy Guarantee. It's time the Leader of the Opposition got on the sticky paper and stopped trying to walk both sides of the street, because we know that when the Leader of the Opposition was part of the Labor government during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years power prices doubled. Power prices went up each and every year. We had the carbon tax; we had the citizens' assembly; we had the cash for clunkers. And we know that the member for Port Adelaide even wrote a book about it. He said, 'I know that we sent too many mixed signals, and we've made mistakes.' We welcome that honesty. But we also know that he thought that what happened in South Australia was merely a hiccup, a big experiment which saw South Australians get the highest prices in the country as a result of bad Labor management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Turnbull government is delivering lower power prices. Last week the wholesale price of power was $68 a megawatt hour; the same time last year it was $101. From 1 July this year, power prices came down in Queensland, in South Australia and in New South Wales through the Prime Minister's intervention in the gas market. The ACCC has said that the reported price reductions are up to 50 per cent. This means more jobs for Australians. And now the National Energy Guarantee will deliver more jobs in the electorate of Wright and around the country. We heard from the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who represent 400,000 Queensland businesses, and they said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the day, the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) promises what weâve all been waiting forâa downward pressure on electricity prices and policy certainty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the boardâfrom energy consumer groups to energy user groups, to the big manufacturers, to the big miners, to the farmers of this country, to the irrigatorsâthey have got behind this policy. Now's the time for the Labor Party to get on the sticky paper and actually walk the talk and help deliver lower power prices for all Australian families and businesses.</span>

Today the government is again promising to reduce power bills by $550 a year. Why would Australians trust any promise this government makes about lower power bills, promises which the member for Warringah, the former Prime Minister, described today as 'merchant banker gobbledegook'?</span>

It's an interesting society. The member for Rankin is LEAN's Queensland patron, and the member for Watson is LEAN's New South Wales patron. I assume that the member for Port Adelaide is LEAN's South Australia patron. The Labor Environment Action Network said on 1 August 2018 that the truest thing said at the Clean Energy Council conference was that 'high prices are not a market failure; they're proof of the market working well'. Really? So, the member for Rankin and the member for Watson should take the member for Port Adelaide with them doorknocking, and when people complain about higher prices they should say, 'Don't you worry about that; this is proof that the market is working well.' I mean, really. That is what the Labor Party is all about.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:33</span>):  I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The Turnbull government is committed to cheaper electricity prices. And, as the Prime Minister just reminded us, the Labor Party thinks the mark of good energy policy is higher electricity prices. If that is the case, then when they were in government they must have thought they had a pretty good policy, because electricity prices under the Labor Party increased 12.2 per cent every single year on average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We arrested the growth in that, and that has come down to an average of only 3.4 per cent. But there's better news than that. In the last quarter, in the June quarter, electricity prices in Australia, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, fell by 1.3 per cent. They came down, and that has been, as the minister has been explaining, because the impact of lower wholesale prices is beginning to flow into a lower retail price and lower prices for consumers. That has been borne out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the Governor of the Reserve Bank has also highlighted that going into this quarter one of the things that will actually be putting pressure down on inflation will be lower utility prices, including electricityâand I note lower childcare prices as well, as a result of the childcare reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our policies are designed to deliver lower and cheaper electricity prices. As we've reminded the House today, that started with getting rid of the carbon tax and has gone all the way through to the most recent ACCC report, which is about supporting and ensuring that we see realised investment to produce more energy in the Australian market, because, when you increase supply, you lower the price. We've secured access to gas. We've ensured customers have been getting a better deal. We have seen the turning point on electricity prices under the policies of this government, and there is broad-based support for the National Energy Guarantee, because it is part of this plan. There's broad-based support because they know the time for shouting at the clouds and shouting at each other on energy policy is over. The time for action and implementing this policy is right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is: what are the Labor Party going to do? Are they going to play politics or are they going to support Australians who don't want to choose between affordable, reliable and sustainable policy? Australians want all three, and that's what the National Energy Guarantee delivers, so it's time for the opposition to get off the fence. It's time for the Labor Party to stop making excuses and get behind the National Energy Guarantee because that delivers cheaper electricity prices. It delivers the certainty that the business and investment community needs to deliver more energy to our markets to ensure there are lower electricity prices. It's time for the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party to get on the National Energy Guarantee bus because it's driving towards lower electricity prices for all Australians.</span>

If you look at the money that they contributed to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in the last year that they were in office, it's around half of what we are putting in. If you look at the money that the department of the environment was contributing to the reef when they were in office, it was about half of what we are contributing. When Labor were in office, they put the Barrier Reef on a path to UNESCO's endangered list. When Labor were in office, they had no long-term plan. When Labor were in office, they didn't provide the funding. When Labor were in office, they had five dredge disposal projects planned for the marine park.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we have come in and put in place a long-term plan for the reef with the Queensland government. We've put in a $2 billion commitment with Queensland. We've made a half a billion dollar commitment through the foundation. We've been praised by UNESCO. And let me tell the House where the money is going to go through the foundation: $201 million is going to go to improving water quality, with changed farming practices, such as reduced pesticide, nitrogen and sediment run-off; $100 million is going to the best science to implement reef restoration, which is why Australia's Chief Scientist welcomed the announcement; $58 million is going to the fight against the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish; $45 million is supporting work increasing community engagement, such as Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management; and $40 million is going towards reef health monitoring and reporting.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundation was supported when Labor was in office. They put money into it. The member for Watson put out a press release saying that the foundation would protect the unique values of the reef. When we announced our $500 million, the member for Sydney welcomed it. The member for Sydney welcomed our announcement. But the member for Herbert has got no money to show, because when Labor were last in office they abandoned the reef. Only the coalition can be trusted to protect regional jobs in Queensland. Only the coalition can be trusted to provide appropriate funding for reef preservation and conservation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr PYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. For the domestic defence industry to thrive, we need power prices coming down, not going up, and the National Energy Guarantee will do just that. The National Energy Guarantee, plus the other measures that the government has already introduced, will see energy prices coming down for households by $550 and, for businesses, the wholesale price coming down by 20 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really important for our defence projects and our defence industry, because, if you think about it, the government is the only customer in defence and defence industry. So, if we get prices coming down, it means that the taxpayer is getting better value for money for our expenditure, and future projects will be cheaper as a consequence of lower power prices. So this isn't some theoretical, ideological debate that Labor likes to conduct. For taxpayers, for the government, reducing power prices means more money for us to spend on other important priorities. For businesses in the manufacturing sectorâlike Marand in Melbourne, the ASC in Adelaide, Austal in Perth or Haulmark Trailers in Brisbaneâit means their prices coming down and their costs coming down, because the amount they spend on power is reduced. So it's really critical to those industries, to the manufacturing sector, if we want them to thrive, have more investment and have more jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that's entirely lost on the Labor Party, because the Labor Party actually supports higher prices. They want higher prices. In fact, when the carbon tax was in place, they smiled every time prices went up. That was because when prices were going up because of the carbon tax it meant the carbon tax was doing its job. Every time prices went up, the carbon tax was doing its job. We scrapped the carbon tax, and prices came down. When we introduce the National Energy Guarantee, prices will come down again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the evidence. The Prime Minister just quoted LEAN, the Labor Environment Action Network. They said at their conference:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">High prices are not a market failure. They are proof of the market working well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, if prices are going up, as far as the Labor Party are concerned, that's exactly the outcome of their policy mix, and that's what will happen if they get elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the Labor Party is that they think Australia should be more like the Shire in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hobbit</span>. They think we should all be living like Bilbo Baggins in our turf houses, smoking our reed pipes, sitting in front of the fireplace, with the smoke curling out of the chimneys of our housesâno economy, no industry, no primary industries and partying all the time. Who's going to pay for it? The reality is only this side of the House can deliver lower power prices, jobs and growth in the economy.</span>

Engagement with the Chairman's Panel allows the foundation to explain the complexity of the challenge, the threats the reef faces and how scientists are responding.

The purpose of this event is to provide a forum for business leaders to directly engage with science, scientists and researchers.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, this is the final bit: the foundation's Independent Scientific Advisory Committee, with many professors, people with doctorates and leading experts in the field, 'is made up of leaders of research and management of the reef, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the University of Queensland, James Cook University and CSIRO'.</span>

He is particularly passionate about Australia's tourism industry and has a very good understanding of the importance of the jobs of the 600,000 Australians that are employed in the tourism industry and the significant contribution that his electorate, in particular, makes. I note that across his electorate he's got around 5,300 people employed in 1Â½ thousand businesses in the tourism industry. Each of those businesses is creating an opportunity for an Australian to be able to secure a job and to service the needs of a diversified regional economy like his. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is backing in Australia's tourism industry. We're providing record funding to Tourism Australia, and as a consequence we've seen record numbers of tourists staying for a record length of time and spending a record amount of money. Those are records that this side of the House can be proud of and that are helping to deliver the jobs and growth that all Australians are looking for. You'll be pleased to know, Member for Dawson, that across the three regional tourism areas that your electorate represents there have been some 446,000 international visitors, who spent around $323 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to ensure that Australia's tourism industry continues to go from strength to strength, we have to back it through sound policy. One of the most important ways that we can back Australia's tourism industry is through sound energy policy, because every tourism operator, every hotel, every small business relies on reliable and cheap energy to be able to ensure they have a robust future.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider Labor's alternative, in the policy that it's put forward. The shadow minister for tourism likes to run around and talk about protecting Labor's legacy when it comes to climate policy. Well, what is Labor's legacy? Labor's legacy on climate change is a carbon tax. Labor's policy going forward is to reintroduce a carbon tax. We know its impact on the industry, as best exemplified by TTF, who described the carbon tax that Labor last introduced as being 'a job-shedding policy'. We know Labor's approach will just ensure that there are fewer opportunities for Australians to be employed in Australia's tourism industry in the future. </span>

She is a champion of small and medium enterprises and businesses in her electorate. Australia is facing an increasingly competitive world. We're more economically integrated. There is greater interdependence through technology and global supply chains. The Australian economy is strong. Under coalition policies, we've created an environment that has seen a record number of one million jobs since we came into government, and a thousand new jobs are being created every day. And we are the fastest growing economy in the OECD, at 3.1 per cent per annum, and we are in our 27th consecutive year of uninterrupted economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But none of this can be taken for granted. That's why the coalition government has an economic plan to keep Australia's economy strong and resilient. In recent meetings with foreign ministers, during the winter break, the issue of business competitiveness was a key themeâbacking the private sector to create job opportunities in countries around the world. Indeed, at our foreign and defence ministers' meetings in the UK and in the US, global economic security was a key theme. The new foreign secretary of the UK, Jeremy Hunt, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo both spoke of the global trend of reducing taxes around the world and backing the private sector so that companies in their countries, and of course in ours, can compete on a level playing field. The United States now has a tax rate of 21 per cent for businesses. The UK has a tax rate for businesses of about 19 per cent, going down to 17 per cent. That's why the coalition government's economic plan is to lower taxes for business, to drive electricity prices down and to pursue free trade agreements for new markets so that we can compete on the world stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked whether there are any risks. Oh yeah, there are risks: the sheer lunacy of the Labor Party's thinking on taxes and costs. The Labor Party believes in higher taxesâin fact, $200 billion of extra taxes. What does $200 billion in extra taxes do for Australia's competitiveness? They want to increase taxes on small and medium enterprises with a turnover under $50 million. We just won't be able to compete. And Labor, we find, believes that higher electricity prices is a sign of market success. No-one in the world believes that having higher electricity prices makes you more competitive. That's why the coalition is backing Australian workers, backing Australian business, because that means more jobs across the country.</span>

Yesterday the environment minister confirmed that the Great Barrier Reef Foundation's formal proposal for the grant was not received by the government until 29 May. This was more than 20 days after the Treasurer had delivered the budget, which included money for the foundation; a month after the grant was announced; and more than a month after the Prime Minister first offered it to the foundationâhalf a billion dollars of taxpayers' money. Why is the Prime Minister so reckless with taxpayers' funds?</span>

And it's going to create jobs in the electorate of the member for Herbert, and the electorates of the member for Flynn, the member for Dawson, the member for Leichhardt and the member for Capricornia. That is why we have invested $500 million in the Great Barrier Reef on top of the $2 billion we have contributed through the Reef 2050 Plan with Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made it very clear that in my correspondence with the chair of the foundation, to whom I formally wrote on 22 April, I said that a formal offer of any Australian government funds is dependent on negotiating and executing a new grant agreement. In consultation with the foundation, they formally lodged their proposal on 29 May. This was after I had released the Commonwealth grant guidelines, with which this was compliant. Now, on 20 June, under section 71 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act, I approved the grant to the foundation, having considered a detailed assessment of the application by my department, which had included the second stage of due diligence by my department and the Australian Government Solicitor. I want to read to the House what my department recommended to me, and I quote: that this investment in the foundation would 'meet the government's policy objective to protect and manage the Great Barrier Reef'; that it 'would represent value for money and a proper use of Commonwealth resources'; and that it was 'consistent with the provisions of the governance and accountability act'. That due diligence included a close examination by the AGS of corporate information, financial reports, compliance with applicable laws, litigation, property searches and ASIC checks of the foundation directors. This has been through the ERC process. This was money put to work with the reef, with our scientists, with our farmers and with Indigenous communities to underpin regional jobs, including the 64,000 jobs that depend on the Great Barrier Reef. So there we have it. The Labor Party only want to obstruct and criticise, because when they were in government they abandoned the Great Barrier Reef.</span>

This government has worked every day to fulfil our election promise, and that was that we would restore order and that we would secure our borders. We have done that, but the problem is that the people smugglers have not gone away. The threat has not disappeared. As we're seeing, in the Mediterranean at the moment people are drowning at sea trying to get to Europe. People in Indonesiaâabout 14,000 people at the momentâare waiting to get onto boats. At the moment, they won't give over money because they don't believe that under this government they will get to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've turned back 33 boats over the course of Operation Sovereign Borders, and we've disrupted over 70 ventures, so we've stopped boats leaving ports. We've been able to work with intelligence and law enforcement agencies across the region to thwart those attempts to bring peopleâinnocent men, women and childrenâby boat to our country. What people know is that under this government there will be a consistency, that our purpose will be very clear and that we are going to continue with the plan because we know that it works. We know that it has taken a long time to clean up Labor's mess. Tragically, 8,000 children went in to detention under Labor. They established the processing centres on Manus and on Nauru. I'm pleased to update the House that we have so far been able to remove 1,106 people from Manus and Nauru that Labor put onto Manus and Nauru. It includes over 300 people going to the United States. We are working day and night to make sure that we get people off Manus and Nauru as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's interesting here is the contrast with the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian public knows this Leader of the Opposition quite often doesn't tell the truth. His whole background is littered with examples. He was a union boss promising workers better rights, but what did he do when he was a union boss? He negotiated with big businesses to take away penalty rates from workers around the country. That's what he did when he was a union boss. What did this Leader of the Opposition do at the last election? He promised he would replicate the Operation Sovereign Borders model. He has worked day and night since then to water down Labor's policy. He is effectively promising the Australian public that, if he's elected Prime Minister at the next election, the boats will restart, that the deaths at sea will recommence and that detention centres will be refilled. Mr Speaker, that is the reality. I would say to you and, through you, to the Australian people: don't trust a word that this man says. Everybody in his history, whether it's in this place or in his work life, doesn't trust him. He's double-crossed most people that he's ever dealt with, and the Australian public should know that, even when he looks them in the eye on border protection, he's not telling the truth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:05</span>):  Thank you to the member for Berowra for his question and for his ongoing interest in keeping Australians safe and secure. He would know that we have had telecommunications interception legislation in this country for 40 years. When that legislation was first put in place in 1979, we only had one telco, which had just changed its name from the PMG to Telecom. There were no mobile phones, and the World Wide Web was still a decade away. So, of course, a lot has changed since thenâthe number of telcos and the number of connected devices, and even the ways we communicate more generally. Our laws have not kept up. If we don't act, we will be giving serious criminals a place to hide, whether they be paedophiles, drug dealers, or terrorists planning an attack on our communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was concerned when I was advised by our agencies that, in the last 12 months alone, in 200 operations investigating very serious crimesâwith penalties of seven years imprisonment or moreâthose agencies were thwarted or in some way inhibited in their ability to get the job done because of the failure of our legislation to be fit for purpose in an era when technology has changed so dramatically. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation I released for public consultation this morning will address these issues. Public consultation is important, because we are willing to take the time to listen to ensure that we get this right. For those who, like me as the minister for cybersecurity, are concerned about the security and privacy of all Australians' data, these important reforms do not require industry to reduce the levels of security that they've developed to enhance privacy for all Australians, and any request for an individual's data will remain subject to the existing warrant processes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot give criminals a place to hide. If we do not act, they will continue to hide on those applications and platforms they believe protect their nefarious activities. This government has a proven track record of balancing individual freedoms with the safety and security of all Australians. I call on those opposite to join the government in supporting these important reforms.</span>

I note not only his passion, pre politics, for constructionâas I've said before, a unique combination of barrister and builderâbut also his passion, since being elected, for small and family business. I've had the honour of being in his electorate several times talking with local small and family businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did want to focus on this most important sector of our economy. In the last five years since the election of a coalition government, we have seen a 17.8 per cent increase in employment in this most valuable sector. We have seen small business growth, with the number of small and family businesses operating in the construction sector seeing a net increase of 21,000 in the last 4Â½ to five years. I was asked about how that compares with the situation under those opposite. In the last 12 months of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, there was a net decrease in the number of small and family business operating, amounting to 8,300. Apart from the economic policies that the Turnbull coalition government have put in place, what has been one of the key planks to this? It has been the reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commissionâthe cop on the beat, protecting the 1.2 million construction workers employed by over 367,000 small and family businesses not just in the seat of Fisher but Australia-wide, protecting them every day from bullying, thuggery and intimidation from the CFMEU.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this morning, Justice Loganâlet's face it, Federal Court judges are not the most outlandish of peopleâsaid about the CFMEU, in a ruling on that wonderful piece of gear David Hanna, the former secretary of the CFMEU in Queensland: 'An organisation which manifests an inability by its internal governance to rein in aberrant behaviour cannot expect to remain registered in its existing form'. But this organisationâpeople like Dave Hanna, formerly with it, and John Setka, the Victorian President of the CFMEUâis who the Leader of the Opposition is beholden to. He has done this secret deal with them. Even those on this own front bench do not know what's in it. He should come clean and tell not just them but the people of Australia, the small and family business operators Australia-wide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first order of business if he's elected will be to get rid of Building and Construction Commission, which uncovers behaviours like we are seeing today. The CFMEU has 74 representatives currently before courts in some 36 matters. That is who those opposite are beholden to. The Leader of the Opposition owes his position, his seat in that chair, to the support of the CFMEU. He should come out and condemn them for the behaviour that they continue to display on a daily basis. On this side of the House, we will stand with small and family business in defence of this behaviour day in and day out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  All Australian households and all Australian businesses know all too deeply that a deep, profound energy crisis has emerged under this Prime Minister. That deep energy crisis has led to a collapse in confidence in our energy system, and it's seen power bills go up and up for households and for businesses. It's very clear what we need to start to bring that crisis to an end. We need sensible, centrist, bipartisan energy policy. But what we saw today by this Prime Minister was the final act of capitulation to the hard Right of the coalition party room on climate change and energy policy. We saw the big man at the press conference declaring victory over his nemesis, the former Prime Minister, but actually what happened in that coalition party room was a weak act of surrender. The white flag is flying high over the Prime Minister's office now because what he announced at the press conference was an energy plan that will not see a single renewable energy project built for a decade, an energy plan that will see the rates of installation of rooftop solar cut by a half and an energy plan that will channel billions and billions of taxpayers' money to building new coal-fired power stations. This is a plan that will smash jobs and investment in renewables. It will achieve no significant cuts in pollution from this sector that is responsible for a third of the total carbon pollution in our economy and it will push power prices up even further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever debate there was, and whatever media leaking and speculation there was, it is very clear that this was a victory for the right wing in the coalition party room. And the fact that the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for New England, was able to support this energy plan tells you everything you need to know about it. This Prime Minister, who once said he would not lead a party that was not as committed to effective action on climate change as he was, has joined the war against renewable energy and bizarrely decided to spend billions of dollars of taxpayers' money on new coal-fired power stations. Any credibility this man had in supporting evidence-based policy and in taking serious action on climate change and power prices lies in tatters today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For two years the Labor Party has been constructive about this policy area. On the emissions intensity scheme that the minister supported before he was vetoed by the former Deputy Prime Minister in 2016 and on the clean energy target, which, again, the Prime Minister and the minister for energy supported last year before being vetoed by the former Prime Minister, federal Labor offered its support in spite of the fact that they were not our preferred policy prescriptions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this National Energy Guarantee we have also been consistently constructive and consistently positive, but what the Prime Minister has offered up today is a plan to smash renewables and to channel taxpayers' money into building coal-fired power stations. We cannot support that. The National Energy Guarantee, which is still the subject of negotiations at the COAG process, is an investment framework, but you have to have a plan for investment to make it mean something. This government's plan for investment will not see a single new renewable energy project built for an entire decade. It will smash investment. The National Energy Guarantee is a vehicle for our energy system that this government intends to drive back to the 1950s. Australians will end up paying the price for this Prime Minister's abject weakness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This plan will smash jobs in renewable energy. It will cause thousands of job losses, according to all modelling, in the renewable energy industry. Just as the former Prime Minister caused one in three jobs in the renewable energy sector to be lost in their last attack on this industry, according to the ABS, this plan will do nothing to cut pollutionânothing!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The firm that's done the modelling for the National Energy Guarantee for this government and the Energy Security Board, Acil Allen, has pointed out recently that a sector responsible for a third of the carbon pollution in our economyâthe electricity sectorâwill do just one-twentieth of the job of reducing pollution to achieve this government's inadequate Paris targets, leaving all the rest of the heavy lifting to other sectors of the economy that don't have low-cost technology available to do it for them, because this Prime Minister is too weak to take the argument up for a serious and ambitious emissions reduction obligation on the electricity sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also do nothing on prices. Particularly this minister trumpets a $550 saving for households from his policy. Where have we heard that before? That's got an odd ring of familiarity to it for most Australian households, who very clearly remember this same party promising that the power bills for Australian households five years ago would go down by $550. I don't know about my colleagues on this side, or on the other side, but I suspect none of them have had a constituent come up and say how glad they are that the Liberal Party's promise was fulfilledâthat their power bills went down by $550âbecause the experience across the country has been power bills going up and up under this government. The $550, or $400 anyway, according to the modellingâthat merchant bankers' gobbledegook, to use the language of the member for Warringahâis connected to Labor's Renewable Energy Target, the bill to discharge the Renewable Energy Target, which this government, thankfully unsuccessfully, tried to abolish a few years ago. The other $150 is some theoretical decrease in borrowing costs for new energy projects. It is hard to see how that will end up in householders' pockets, when the government's own modelling shows that a not a single new project will actually be built. This is funny money that households will never end up seeing. What households will end up seeing under this government, particularly pensioner households and households in receipt of allowances, is a $365 cut to the energy supplement. If they are a couple they will see a cut of around $550 a year, not the $150 funny money through a reduction in borrowing costs. This is real money that this government has been trying for two years now to cut from some of our lowest income households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to all of the modelling and all of the expert advice, the surest way to bring down power prices is to expand renewable energy. Modelling by RepuTex released only a few weeks ago showed that wholesale power prices under Labor's more ambitious plan to cut emissions by 45 per cent would be 25 per cent lower through the course of the 2020s than under this government's inadequate plan, which will see no investment and no downward pressure on power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But perhaps the most abjectly weak element of the Prime Minister's announcement today is that over the last few days he has decided to channel billions of taxpayers' dollars into building new coal-fired power plants, which the industry itself has said are uninvestable. Kerry Schott, the Chair of the Energy Security Board, the board providing advice on energy policy to this government, has said there is no way companies will be investing in new coal-fired power stations, not just because they take eight to 12 years to build, not just because they're massively more expensive than solar and wind power, a fact borne out by the government's own modelling, and not just because of the enormous carbon risk, the price risk and the regulatory risk that investors are shying away from, but because they're simply not going to work in the modern electricity market. The member for Eden-Monaro pointed out in his first question to the Prime Ministerâand I'm sure he will have more to say about it this afternoonâthat Snowy Hydro has made it very clear that you can have new coal or you can have Snowy 2.0. You simply cannot have both. Snowy 2.0 works only in an environment where there is substantial new building of renewable energy, something that the Prime Minister has weakly vetoed in his announcement today. For this governmentâwhich I originally thought had a plan to land an energy policy that would have broad political and industry supportâto achieve that plan, this Prime Minister had to stare down the hard Right. We've seen today that he's too weak to do it. He has completely capitulated to the anti-renewables ideology of the hard right wing of the party room. Australians will pay the price. They will pay the price for his weakness. They will pay the price in fewer jobs, more pollution and higher power prices.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FRYDENBERG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  When the coalition came to government, it inherited a basket case of an energy system from the Labor Party. We all remember the chaos and dysfunction that characterised the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. We remember prices going up each and every year. We remember Australian households being hit by a doubling of energy prices when Labor was in office. We remember that great Athenian model of democracy, the citizen's assembly. We remember Cash for Clunkers, that great idea that was right up there with pink batts. And we remember the dreaded carbon tax, which imposed a multibillion-dollar impost on Australian families and businesses, so much so that Labor had to spend billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money shovelling it out the door in one hit to the coal-fired generators. You don't hear them talk about that much anymore. That was the Labor Party's record when they were in office. We know that the member for Port Adelaide was quite embarrassed by it, because he put out a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate Wars</span>, in which he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The truth is that we in Labor had sent too many mixed signals about climate policy â¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ we've made mistakes in â¦ the design of our policiesâ</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">and, wait for itâ</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ Australia's voters were determined to see the back of the Labor Government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the reality of what happened when Labor was in office. They also ignored the advice of their own Energy Market Operator about the impact that the large gas export industry on the east coast of Australia would have on the supply-demand dynamic, driving prices up and reliability down. That was the impact of their ignoring of the Energy Market Operator's advice in their own energy document.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We came to government with that situation. What did we do? We abolished the carbon tax. The member for Port Adelaide seems to dispute how much of a saving went to Australian families. The ABS said that the abolition of the carbon tax resulted in the single biggest drop in electricity prices ever recorded. I'm reading from an ACCC press release on 28 July 2015:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC believes that, given all the available information, the Commonwealth Treasury's estimated $550 cost savings to households is reasonable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the ACCC. Since that time the Abbott and then Turnbull governments have been taking action across the board to reduce power prices. We've done a number of things. We've intervened in the gas market to ensure more gas goes to Australians before it's exported overseas. The ACCC have reported that making that available to the market has seen gas prices drop by up to 50 percent. That is good news not only for electricity users, because, as some of the big coal-fired generators have come out of the system, gas has been setting the price of electricity about twice as much as previously, but also for large energy users for whom gas is an important feedstock. I'm talking about the fertiliser, chemical and paper industries and so forth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wholesale electricity prices are falling significantly. The wholesale electricity price is down by about 25 per cent this year. Last week the wholesale spot price was around $68 per megawatt hour compared to $101 per megawatt hour at the same time last year. That is happening as a result of the Turnbull government's interventions. Network costs have also been cut. Rates of return when Labor was in office were about eight to 10 per cent. It has now fallen to around five to six per cent. That can be worth a couple of hundred dollars a year to households. I took legislation through this parliament successfully abolishing the limited merits review, which has meant that no longer are the networks gaming the system. If Labor had done that when they were in office, they would have saved Australian consumers $6.5 billion, but they didn't do it; it has been up to us. Now we have a new binding rate of return, which could also save significant costs to consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're helping customers to get a better deal through the retail market. Since the Prime Minister's meeting with retailers last August 1.6 million households on expired or default plans have been contacted and offered better deals, half a million households have moved off the expired or default plans to better deals, and another 1.3 million households have got better deals. There's also the government's Energy Made Easy website. For those who are listening on their radios across the country, energymadeeasy.gov.au is the government's comparator website. When you go on it, you can compare your electricity bill to those offered by other retailers and save hundreds of dollars that way. It has had over a million hits since the Prime Minister met with the retailers. Electricity prices turned the corner on 1 July this year when prices came down in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, and we're hoping to see the same thing happen when Victoria does a reset in January.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also invested in important energy infrastructure. Most importantly, as the member for Eden-Monaro celebrated, welcomed, was delighted, was excited, was jumping from his chair with joy, that the Turnbull government is delivering Snowy 2.0, a major energy infrastructure project, a pumped hydro scheme which will be the largest of its kind in this part of the world, that will be 2,000 megawatts, that will create 5,000 jobs, that will power 500,000 homes. That's the reliability that we are bringing to the east coast of Australia, which Labor never did. We're investing in pumped hydro projects, through ARENA and elsewhere, in Cultana in the Upper Spencer Gulf, in the member for Grey's electorate in South Australia, and in Kingston in Queensland. We've identified 14 high priority or highly probable pumped hydro projects and hydro projects across Tasmania, to help Tasmania become the battery of the nation. We've talked about a second interconnector to provide Tasmanians with energy security and also to provide more power into the east coast of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this work is having an impact, but it also leads us to the National Energy Guarantee, which I'm so pleased that my colleagues endorsed today to take to the next stage, when the states will hopefully sign on before the end of October. The states now have no excuse. They asked our party room to endorse it, and we did. The National Energy Guarantee was put together by the independent experts. Together with our other policies, it will drive electricity bills down by $550 for the average household, and wholesale prices by 20 per cent, which could be worth millions of dollars to the large energy users. It also has the enormous support of industry, business and energy consumer groups. Listen to what Energy Consumers Australia said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the Final Detailed Design of the National Energy Guarantee â¦ includes updated modelling which confirms that the Guarantee can deliver much needed savings for households and businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was Energy Consumers Australia. What about the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representing more than 400,000 Queensland small businesses? I'm speaking to the member for Dawson, because the member for Dawson has many businesses that would be involved with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the day, the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) promises what weâve all been waiting for â a downward pressure on electricity prices and policy certainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New South Wales, the 190-year-old New South Wales Business Chamber, with 19,000 businesses, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia can't afford more flip-flopping on energy policy. We need to get a national energy policy that provides certainty, improves energy affordability and security and reduces emissions before the end of 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are similar endorsements in Victoria, in Tasmania and across South Australia. We've seen BHP, we've seen Rio Tinto, we've seen Aurora, we've seen Dow Chemical, we've seen the National Farmers' Federation, we've seen BlueScope. We've seen Energy Users Association and Manufacturing Australia. We've just seen the Australian Industry Group; Chemistry Australia, representing a $40 billion industryâthe likes of 3M, Dow, Ixom, Qenos, Orica. These are the companies that employ millions of Australiansâblue-collar workers. They are imploring us to support the National Energy Guarantee. They say, 'Listen to the experts.' They say, 'Put aside your politicking and your posturing. Get behind a policy that puts consumers first. Get behind a policy that maintains our international competitiveness. Get behind a policy which will reduce the bills of Australian families.' That's why the Turnbull government is getting on with the National Energy Guarantee. That's why the Turnbull government can deliver lower power prices. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'm very delighted to follow the minister, the member for Kooyong, who follows in the proud traditions of the most memorable member for Kooyong, the first colt. I think the current minister is probably the second colt. He certainly replicates Andrew Peacock in being all potential but never realised. That's the sad truth of the minister's contribution, because he skips over one important fact in his speech. He has been in power for five years. They have been in power for five years.

                  </a>  In office, maybe, not in power. They're responsible, over those five years, for a doubling of wholesale energy prices and for the retirement of 5,000 megawatts of coal-fired power without adequate replacement. That is on his desk. That occurred on his watch, but he would have us forget all about that. He would have us forget it, think that we'd just woken up and that yesterday was September 2013 and now we're here, with nothing in between. But what we've had is five years of coalition infighting on energy policy that has led to a doubling of wholesale energy prices. We had Direct Action for three yearsâthat 'fig leaf' and 'fiscal recklessness', as the Prime Minister referred to it. We had Josh's emissions intensity scheme for 12 hours, and what a glorious 12 hours it was! The minister did an interview with Fran Kelly in the morning, which was quite articulate, quite reasonable, quite sensible. Within 12 hours, he'd surrendered. I've had indigestion for longer than Josh's EIS policy! That's the sad truth of Josh's approach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the clean energy target for a year. Again, it was junked because he couldn't get it through the conservatives in his own party room. Now we've landed at the National Energy Guarantee, the NEG, founded on a six-page letter. We had the minister and the Prime Minister claiming credit today that they stood up to the bullies in the party room and they stood down the conservatives. They stood them down. Unfortunately, seven words undermine his argument completely. Seven words undermine his argument about the NEG: as endorsed by Barnaby Joyce. 'As endorsed by Barnaby Joyce' is the sad truth of this policy. This is abject surrender. This is the equivalent of a nation that's been invadedâas the foreign troops are walking down their main avenueâdoing a press conference, saying, 'That was our plan all along. Having those foreign troops walking down our avenues was the plan all along.' It's a sad, sad indictment of energy policy in this country. Such is their abject surrender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What would the NEG deliver in terms of decarbonising our economy? It would deliver four wind turbines over a decadeânot four wind farms, four wind turbines. That is less than what we put in place each week! That is the sad truth of this policy: emissions reductions of fewer than two per cent over a decade. What's even worse is that we're now at a stage in the energy market where investing in renewable energy is also investing in lower power prices. So, by standing in opposition to renewable energy and decarbonising our economy, they are also standing in opposition to reducing power prices. That is the sad truth of their stance. It's been confirmed by RepuTex's economic modelling, which said that if Labor's policy of around 45 per cent emissions reduction is adopted then power prices will be 25 per cent lower than under the proposal by the coalition. Even if you look at the government's claimed $550 of power savings, $400 of the $550 comes from Labor's Renewable Energy Target, not their NEG. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad truth is they are standing against the tide of history. The brutal economic facts are that if you support renewable energy you will not only decarbonise the economy; you will also drive lower power prices. You can achieve both. They stand in opposition to both, because the Prime Minister and the minister couldn't stand up to the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah; they couldn't stand up to the member for New England; they couldn't stand up to all the other fossils in the party room. But it's not just them who will suffer. It's households in our electorates that will suffer. It's our children who will suffer. It's our grandchildren who will suffer. The government will be condemned by history for this abject surrender.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  Let's face it: that was five minutes of our lives that we will never get back! It was not a hole in one on the mini golf course speech. In fact, it was quite the reverse. It was a long diatribe off the worst drive down the fairway from the member for Shortland. But this is the problem that we now have with the Australian Labor Party and their position on energyâincoherent and lacking an understanding about the fundamental nature of the market and what is necessary to deliver cheaper prices to households and reductions in emissions, or how to make sure that when people turn on the switch the light comes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make these remarks as somebody who, frankly, was proud to oppose the emissions trading scheme introduced by the former Labor governmentâproud of the fact that I fought the carbon tax, which was fundamentally bad policy. It would have undermined the security we needed in this country, it would have shifted too much of the burden onto technology that wasn't able to deliver the outcomes that Australians needed and, ultimately, it would have delivered price hikes well in excess of even the ones we incurred under the bad policies of the previous government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is also why I support the National Energy Guarantee. It's the first policy put down on the table of the nation that actually allows for technologies that produce energy to be compared like for like because they carry obligations. Renewables, with their role of making sure that we provide energy using the forces of the earth, carry with them obligations that they have to be reliable at the same time and they have to compete in a fair marketplace. Fossil fuelsâcoal or gas, traditional and conventional fuelsâhave to meet emissions reduction obligations as part of competing against renewables. But you get like for like, apple for apple, not the current opposition's policy, which is simply to favour some technologies, force them into the market and pass the buck onto Australian households and consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the NEG seeks to doâstabilise the market to drive investment to improve the outcome for Australian households. It also spells the end of the bad policy that has infected the national energy grid, led by bad policymaking by people in this place in years past, and the end of programs by allowing them to go to a natural end, like the Renewable Energy Target, which no-one's disputing has forced a lot of renewable energy into the grid but at the incredible expense of reliabilityâhaving a stable marketâand, of course, at the incredible expense of households, who have had to pick up the bill to subsidise the interests of multinational corporations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of this chamber, they're concerned about the top end of town, despite their protests, but they're only interested in the multinational renewable top end of town. They're interested not in consumers or in the interests of Australian households but merely in the people who come in from overseas and bring technology. And they think they should enjoy a subsidy along the way, often to the extent of tens of millions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I compare the end of the RET and all these other programs, and what's being done with the NEG, to the end of tariffs, where you had huge distortions in the economy and the market that were mostly picked up by passing the costs on to consumers. The challenge for this government, which it is actually going to meet through the NEG, is to undo that damage to create a stable environment for new investment and to actually have a competitive market operating that seeks to drive down prices and deliver the outcomes that households and consumers need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What will we see if we go down the NEG path? Yes, we will see an increase in investment, and, yes, it will be technology neutral, so we're going to leave it to the market to decide what to invest. Yes, there will be an increase in supply, including of low-cost energy sources, which will deliver cheaper bills for Australian households. That's a pretty good outcome. What are the obstructions to this path, to building the investment that will grow the future economic opportunity of this nation? It is those that sit opposite, as they carry on like a bunch of schoolchildren over whether they should support this policy, and of course the Victorian state government, who seem to have no interestâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  Well, it's happened again, hasn't it? The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, all of them, are selling out once again. Brave, brave Sir Malcolm, like a character out of <span style="font-style:italic;">Holy Grail</span>, has bravely turned tail and fled! This man, in his cowering, craven capitulation to the carbon-captured members of his own party room, has given up on the very things he said in this chamber. We were all here, weren't we? We watched that speech he gave, backing in Labor's climate change and renewable energy policy and crossing the floor to vote for it. Where are those days now? Where is this hollow man?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we've been discussing, of course, the effect of this NEG on the market, renewable energy and climate change. This Prime Minister and this policy are the biggest threat to the Snowy 2.0 project, which they've touted as their great vision. In fact, we know it wasn't. It was just a project Malcolm photobombed that the Snowy Hydro Corporation had in train well before he discovered it. They'd put in their feasibility funding application to ARENA, the body those opposite tried to destroy in February last year before Malcolm turned up in March. And, of course, the Snowy 2.0 project will be funded from their own money and from private investmentânot a cent from this government. That's a critical factor: private investment. One of the most important factors of the Snowy 2.0 project was that an economic feasibility study was conducted by Marsden Jacob Associates. That report tells you everything you need to know about the way the market needs to go and about the relevance of Snowy 2.0. This government tried to bury that report. They told Snowy Hydro: 'Don't put that out there, for God's sake. Please don't do it.' That's been confirmed by Snowy Hydro. They've said their shareholder asked them not to put it out there. Eventually, Snowy Hydro did anyway because they had to. Why? Because their investors need to know this information. And the decision that's going to be made in December will be affected by the factors spelt out in this report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And here is the report. This is it. It exists on the Snowy Hydro website. None of these guys have read it, and I think that is the greatest advertisement for the need for more investment in education, because these guys didn't read the Finkel report and they haven't read any of this. And some journalists need to have a closer look at this, too. What you'll see spelt out, when they talk about the economics, is that the long-term commitment on renewable energy makes the Snowy 2.0 project feasible economically. It gives it its greatest economic and market impact. And what is the long-term commitment that is spelt out in this report? There it is on page 4. That long-term commitment is a target of 60 per cent renewable generation by 2040. There it is in black and white, and it matches, by the way, perfectly with Labor's renewable energy target trajectory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is an ambitious renewable energy target that makes Snowy 2.0 viable. That is the way it will work in relation to the market, by providing the firming to that transition to 100 per cent renewables, so any attempt to slow down that transition to renewables or to reintroduce coal-fired power will threaten the viability. And we know that because the CEO of Snowy Hydro and their chief operating officer have told us that. Paul Broad said: 'From our perspective, new coal doesn't stack up. We'll outcompete them on price and reliability. We can outcompete a new HELE plant. And Snowy 2.0 only stacks up when more coal power exits the market. The amount of coal base load that comes out of the market determines the viability of Snowy 2.0.' And, of course, that's been backed up by other experts, including David Carland, an energy finance specialist, who said that the government has a choice. This is really what underpinned my question today. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The development of a major new coal-fired station will destroy the viability of Snowy 2.0. The federal government needs to make a choice: does it want Snowy 2.0 or does it want a major new coal-fired station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And everything in this Marsden Jacob report underlines that coal is dead as a future source of power. It will gradually phase out. It spells out the time lines for the major power stations that will die. But it also says that carbon capture and storage and these technologies they tout are not sustainable for the future of the market. In fact, they say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the technology is not yet commercially deployed and is unlikely to be viable without a significant price on carbon â¦ This technology has not been proven on a commercial or large scale, its costs are not known, and it is considered unlikely that it will be commercially viable until well into the 2030s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  One would read into the wording of this matter of public importance todayâwhich is 'The division in the government over its energy policy'âthat the Labor Party, of course, doesn't have any division on major issues. I welcome the fact that my party is able to discuss things in a robust way and that there are alternative points of view. I well remember the lead-up to the 2013 election when the member for Hunter was caught on television laughing at the Prime Minister's talking points. The Prime Minister at the time was Julia Gillard. The member for Hunter said: 'I brought the manual with me. I'll see what it says.' There is only one view from the Labor Party because having an alternative view means expulsion from the party. Are we to assume, for instance, by the wording of this MPI, that 100 per cent of Labor Party members are in favour of lifting the renewable target to 45 per cent by 2030 and there's no division in the party? Are we to assume that they are in favour of raising taxes on small and medium business owners? In fact, are we to assume that there is no dissent in their ranks over the policing of the integrity of our borders? Is it 100 per cent over there? Is there no alternative view in the Labor Party? Goodness me! What a load of rubbish! Well, of course there is in the Liberal Party. There are alternative views are on all major topics, and that's something we should be proud of, and we actually foster that within our ranks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me tell you a little bit about electricity. I've said to my party room this morning that I have been around this story of electricity in Australia for, I think, longer than anyone in this House, because it was in 2011 that Alinta came to me and said: 'We are having trouble at our Northern Power Station. What's happening in South Australia is that we're getting an explosion of renewable energy under the auspices of the RET, and it's actually reducing the number of days on which we can sell electricity into the market at a profit.' In 2012 I met with the AEMO commissioner, and he said to me at the time: 'Don't worry about it, Mr Ramsey. Even if the Northern Power Station at Port Augusta closes, the upgraded interconnector will take care of that. South Australia will be all right. You've got nothing to worry about.' Well, he was wrong and I was right, unfortunately. We were plunged into darkness. South Australia currently has 52 per cent renewable energy, and let me tell you: even though there are no longer incentives there in the RET, people are still building. That's fine. I'm not upset about people building wind farms and solar farms. But every one that gets built undermines the business case of the baseload generators. It reduces the number of days a year that they can supply electricity into the market at a profit. But we need them. Even though it might be only 20 days a year or 40 days a year, we absolutely need them, because there are no other answers in the system at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the NEG does is provide an incentive for operators to build baseload electricity, because at the moment, as long as those on that side of this House sit across there and say, 'Whatever you do, when we get into government we're going to undo it,' there will be no investment in baseload electricity. We've had an investment freeze for years now. We've got the business community on side. We've got the consumer groups on side. I think we'll get all of the state governments on side, but we've got most of them. What we need is for the Labor Party to come on side and say, 'All right, we accept that for Australia's benefit we need to land on some mutual ground, and we will not promise destruction if elected to parliament.' That's when you'll see the coffers of private investment open up, and they will start to invest in new generation capacity in Australia that will provide baseload electricity to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our best chance. We have nearly all the balls lined up. This morning in our party room, there was overwhelming support for pushing ahead with this course of action. I am very confident that the minister will reach agreement with the states in the next month or so. What we needâwhat Australia needsâis a signal from the Labor Party that they'll come on board too and we'll get bipartisanship. I heard a call for bipartisanship on the other side. This is your opportunity. Show the investors of Australia that you've got faith in Australia, you've got faith in the citizens and you want to help reduce power prices, not send power prices northward. Do you really want to go to the next election saying, 'I'm in favour of higher power prices?' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

National policy on energy security should deliver two things: it should deliver reliable energy and it should meet our renewable targets. The Prime Minister keeps trying to convince Labor that his government has the settings right, but it's not us that they need to convince. We know where we stand. In 2016, Labor supported an emissions intensity scheme. That scheme was vetoed in the coalition's party room by the backbench. In 2017, we supported the Clean Energy Target. Again, it was vetoed in the coalition's party room by the backbench. And now we get to see the real Prime Ministerâa Prime Minister who is unable to lead a party, a Prime Minister who is held hostage by climate change deniers and right-wing ideologues, a Prime Minister who would sell out the future of Australia's energy security to appease a small, vocal minority in his party room.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the 2018 Future Thinking Conference, hosted by the Energy Users Association of Australia, Dr Kerry Schott opened her presentation with some ideas and with an assurance that no new coal power would be built, NEG or no NEG. She said that there is no longer an investment case to build new coal-fired power stations in Australia, because 'the cost of coal is always going to be more than the cost of wind and sun'. Let me repeat that: 'the cost of coal is always going to be more than the cost of wind and sun'. She continued:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">You are unlikely to see a new coal-fired generation plant built unless there is a change in technology and a decline in the price of coal.</span>

For several years now they've invested their time, their knowledge, their skills and their resources into developing new renewable technologyâinto developing inverters and batteries for solar power. They've come a long way in what they've achieved, pouring their hearts and souls into their work. Kevin Davies came to see me the other day, concerned about this government's NEG, and particularly concerned, as we are, that the woefully low emissions targets will ensure that there will be no investment in renewables, despite the fact that renewables are cheaper. The low emissions target that this government has put forward, because this Prime Minister has capitulated to the right-wing of his backbench, will not encourage investment in any large-scale renewable projects for a decade. These are all facts. They are undeniable facts, and the Prime Minister needs to stand up and listen. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  Right now, for the first time in quite a while, there is an absolute gulf between the coalition's energy policies and those of the Labor Party. Whilst the Labor Party have previously been sitting on the fence, it now seems they are coming out in abject opposition to the National Energy Guarantee, and it seems as though they are now talking about the fact that higher electricity costs are not a problem for the Australian people but are in fact proof that the system is working. The Labor Party now has this modus operandi which effectively says, 'When we have really high electricity prices, that's proof that everything is just fine.' It's a huge gulf in policy. It's a difference in priorities between those of us representing regional areas, where we understand that many people are having trouble paying their energy bills, be they electricity or gas. More importantly, when they head off to work in high-energy industries and businesses, they're under pressure to hold their jobs, because of the sheer cost of running those businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this has happened in a state where the Labor Party has a moratorium on gas extraction and exploration. They have some scientific process to look at where the reserves of gas are, but if you want to cut through all the rubbish, you'll find that nothing has happened in relation to gas. They are scared senseless in Victoria, and the state Labor Party are doing absolutely nothing when it comes to onshore gas. They're happy for another part of Australia, like Western Australia, to develop a gas industry and pipe or ship gas over to Victoria, but they don't want any onshore gas in Victoria, because while it's okay for another state, somehow or other it's not okay for Victoria. They are quite happy for the cost of energy and electricity in Victoria to go through the roof, because they have a system of thinking that says, 'We're going to be the environmental guardians of our own state,' but are happy to bring gas into the system that has been extracted in other states. I heard the previous speaker talk about how we should be looking at more wind and solar, backed up by gas. That's fine for Western Australia. I hope that's what they do in Western Australia. We're not allowed to do that in Victoria, because Victoria has stopped any drilling or extraction of gas in that state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any onshore gas is taboo, even though none of the 1.5 million gas wells around the world have any scientific evidence to suggest contamination of aquifers or some health problems for the people surrounding them. However, the GetUp!s, the Lock the Gates, the Labor Party and the Greens are all still talking about the evils associated with extracting natural gas from wells around Australia. Unfortunately the poor people in Victoria have to wear this, because that's the leadership that they have. The arguments around gas were previously described by former Labor Party Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, I think, as the worst policy debate that Australia has ever had, because fear, sensationalism and lies have overcome the science. As we know, many of the people in the Greens, and the GetUp!s and the Lock the Gates, are continually putting to the National Party, 'Why don't you believe in climate change and accept the science?' I accept the science associated with climate change; why don't the Labor Party and the Greens accept the science when it comes to gas? They're too scared to accept that there is no science with a negative view of gas exploration.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current main industry players in Australia are hugely supportive of the NEG. The vast majority of the government party room are hugely supportive of the NEG. The Labor Party seem to think it's a crime if you have a view outside that of the party room, but we in the National and Liberal parties think it the best thing ever that you can speak your mind in this parliament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What must it be like to say to Alice or Isla or Jack or Ronan, 'Sorry kids; as much as I love you, there were some big bullies who wouldn't let me do what I knew was right'?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be absolutely galling, but that's exactly what we're seeing opposite, with a hopeless division that means the Prime Minister faces something within his party room that he has no power to control. His weakness means that the future he is leaving, not just for his grandchildren but for all our grandchildren, is a much poorer future. The one legacy he might have been able to leave, the one ambition, the one that cost him his job first time round, the one policy that could have shaped Australia's future as a 21st century energy market and the one policy that could lower energy prices for consumers is yet another thing that the Prime Minister is profoundly failing at. He's too weak to fight the Neanderthal view within his party that we need new coal. That view is not shared by anyone with any credibility anywhere in the world. The chair of the Energy Security Board, Dr Kerry Schott, says the cost of building a new coal-fired power plant is always going to be more than the cost of wind and sun. Dr Schott says the cost of running a clean-coal plant is much more expensive than running a combination of wind, solar and gas, or, better yet, wind, solar and pumped hydro. She is one of many. There is consensus. Now all we need is consensus on that side of the House. That's what we're not getting. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not come to this place in my 50s only to focus on what life is like for Australians in the second half of their lives. We need to focus on what life is like for my children now, for when they're my age, for their whole generation, for their children and for their children's children. It's time those opposite got their heads out of the sand. There is a clear and pressing need to act and to act now. The fight that they're having gives the lie to the fact that for years the industry investors have been saying they need a clear set of rules, a framework which allows them to make decisions and which doesn't get dumped from one government to another. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my work before parliament, with investors, I remember the relief at a policy announcement that Australia would have a price on carbon. There was the hope of certainty. That was years ago. Since then it's been a shambles because of the lack of leadership on that side of the chamber and by this Prime Minister. As soon as the investment framework is in place the industry will be able to move forward. It is so keen to move forward. It's vital for us to have a framework now and then to have enough ambition to drive investment. That's what the government's plan lacks. Their target will be reached before the NEG really starts, with rooftop solar alone helping it achieve that target. How ambitious is their target? We're talking two per cent. That's the actual target that we're really talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian National University found the proposalâreduction targets of 26 per cent on 2005 levelsâwill put Australia towards the bottom of 35 OECD countries. Guess what? That weakens our investment potential. The ANU College of Law researcher Dr James Prest said that Australia may even be at risk of failing its international obligations. Let's be clear: our international obligations under Paris were very, very modest. By international comparison, he says that Australia's aim for renewable energy is clearly quite unambitious. That's what we're talking about: ambition. My ambition is that we leave a better future for our children. This policy doesn't do that. Dr Prest says that the review of renewable targets in all OECD countries shows that only five of the 34 countries have a lower target than Australia and some of these already have high levels of renewable electricity production. Who will be below us? The Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Canada andâwait for itâthe United States. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the consequence of having such an unambitious target? It is a disaster for this country going forward. We're throwing $444 million at the Great Barrier Reef but not addressing the real issues that matter. We need decent targets that protect all our children and grandchildren. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Acknowledging the incredible passion around this topic, a topic that for 11 years has galvanised Australia like no other OECD economy, the debate between environment and energy, we are slowly getting to the point where experts have come together to design a structure that looks after three mutually exclusive fields: affordability, responsibility and reliability. You can toss a dime, and it's not going to land on an area that's going to cover those three areas adequately. I guess our great concern is that the Labor Party, until now, in their six years in government, simply watched energy prices double. The Labor Party, at federal and state level, continue to exacerbate the situation with their job-destroying bans and moratoria on exploration, and their unrealistic renewable targetsâwhich at this point cannot be met in a way that allows pensioners to pay their power billsâand their open hostility to dispatchable, reliable baseload power. This is a real fatwa against these areas of power policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government just takes another approach to this. We are taking action to fix this mess to make sure that people can afford their power bills. We are focusing on just keeping the lights on before we start worrying about renewable targets for 10 and 20 years in advance, when I'm sure we'll be apologising for the actions of Labor governments right now. The National Energy Guarantee cuts electricity prices, ends subsidies, ends the picking of winners and ends the passing on of these costs directly to consumers. We're endeavouring now to create a level playing field, an agnostic energy source approach that means more supply and ultimately lower prices. It's about having all forms of energy competing equally in Australia's energy mix. That $300 a year that we are reliably informed can be savedâan average of $550 a year deep into the 2020sâunder the NEG will make a real difference to families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're requiring power companies to cut better deals, to inform customers of the better arrangement and to secure gas supplies for Australia rather than exporting gas overseas and putting downward pressure on network costs. Labor's alternative indicates some scotomaâa blind spotâthat they are unable to address. Our actions are already having some impact. Wholesale prices are already down, thanks to gas availability, by about 25 per cent. My state of Queensland has had an 8.5 per cent drop in small-business power prices, and around 5.4 per cent for households. Labor's alternative has primarily been one of blackouts and higher energy prices, which they get away with by offering small payouts to pensioners to keep them onside. We know that when Labor was last in office these prices doubled, and then we had a leader of the Labor Party with a 50 per cent renewable energy target and no idea of how we'll get there, no idea of what price will be paid by pensioners. We're going to put pensioners first, put low-income households first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new tax on electricity means that if Labor's back in office power bills could be $500 a year higher than they would otherwise need to be. That's way too much of a burden on Australians' shoulders. Let's put our shoulder to the wheel and do our part and allow others to do the same before reckless policies harm jobsâbecause once you lose a local job it often doesn't come back. This guarantee has been backed by the expert Energy Security Board. It's made of these two obligations. First of all, the thing you never hear Labor say, is the reliability obligation. It's set to deliver the right level of dispatchable energy from ready-to-use sources. That might be coal, gas, hydro or whatever, but it's got to be there, in the thousands of megawatts, to make sure that when wind and solar enters irregularly into the grid we can cope with it. This makes retailers responsible to have that base load available; otherwise, they can pay large penalties for failing to do so, and a price fall is the result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People ask, 'How can the NEG reduce prices?' Well, it does so by reducing those spikes where power is inordinately expensive for very short periods of time. This allows Australians to have more money in their pockets. That's where they want the money. They don't want it going to energy retailers. Memo to Labor: we don't enjoy paying high power bills where we don't have to. When it comes to reliability, no longer should intermittent sources like wind and solar be surging into our grid, causing the risks of brownout and the inability to have base load go to go with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank a number of the groups that got behind the NEG: the BCA, ACCI, AiG, Manufacturing Australia, and all of the energy usersâBHP, BlueScope, Rio, Santos, JBS, Origin, AGL, EnergyAustralia, Energy Networksâand all of the irrigators and the mineral councils, the forestry product producers, infrastructure partnerships, Grattan and energy consumers. They're all lined up against the Labor Party. They have this party in the crosshairs. Stand up for reliability and affordability and support the NEG.</span>

Labor is very concerned about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 as a whole. We voted against it last time it was before the House, because of the reduction in the repayment threshold for higher education contributions. We think that this is another example of the Turnbull government's war on young people. We've just heard this week of young people going without food while they're studying at university.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government seems to be making it harder and harder for people to get a higher education. They've tried to cut university funding every single opportunity that they have had throughout the entire period that they've been in government since they were elected five years ago. They originally tried to implement a 20 per cent cut to public funding for universities and a reduction in the HECS repayment threshold. They then tried to make it a 7Â½ per cent cut, plus an additional cut on top of that. That also failed in the Senate. Then, last year, what did they do in MYEFO? They implemented a $2.2 billion cut to university funding, and that is being felt on university campuses around this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does this government have such a problem with higher education? Why is this government seeking to find ways to cut higher education funding every time it gets the opportunity, and why does it seek to make life harder for students and people who have recently been to university? Make no mistake: that's what this bill does. HECS, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, was supposed to be an income-contingent loan scheme, because it purported to represent the private value of higher education.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  It's important that we acknowledge that two tranches of amendments are being considered together: the first tranche by the government is to change some of the timing in relation to the implementation of these measures, and the second tranche that had come from the crossbench relates to loans fees in respect of the HECS arrangements and the FEE-HELP arrangements for certain table 2 institutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will oppose both sets of amendments. Obviously they're being considered together. We are very concerned about the continuation of the coalition's war on young people. This is yet another example of this government trying to make it harder for people to get a higher education and trying to make it harder for people who are on low incomes to be able to get by. This is a government that doesn't care about the housing affordability crisis facing young people in this country. They absolutely do not care about the fact that young people are finding it harder and harder to get a quality education. It's not just the $270 million that was cut from vocational education in this year's budget. There was also $2.2 billion cut out of universities in MYEFO alone last year. This is yet another example of the war on young people. The government is now seeking to decrease the point at which people make a higher education contribution. This is an attempt to make people who are worse off pay HECS, even though they are demonstrably not receiving a private benefit from their higher education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of HECS is for people to make a contribution in recognition of the private benefit they receive. How much private benefit is someone getting from their higher education if they're on 42 grand a year? How well off is someone on $42,000 or $45,000 a year? What do you think you're doing with these changes? You are making it harder for people to get by. You're making it harder for young people, particularly, to get by. We don't know, on this side of the House, why you hate young people so much. We don't know why the Turnbull government is so, so determined to make it harder for people to get a higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the government were elected in 2013, they have taken every opportunity to attack the higher education sector. There was the 20 per cent public funding cut that they tried to bring in in the 2014 horror budget. They failed to get that through. Then there was the 7Â½ per cent funding cut plus an additional funding cut on top of that last year. They failed to get that through. They finally got through their $2.2 billion cut administratively, bypassing the parliament, in MYEFO, and now they're making a further attack on our university system and on young people, reducing the threshold so that people who are earning very low amounts of money have to start making an additional contribution to the Commonwealth government because they had the temerity to get above their station and go to university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how the other side feels about us and the people that we represent going to university, because the Prime Minister has told us. The Prime Minister looked over at our side and said, 'Look at you people; you all went to university, ' as if having a higher education is something that we should be ashamed of. But we are proud of the fact that so many of us on this side of the parliament are the first in our family to go to university. Our parents might have left school at 15. Our grandparents might have had to live in a tent during the Depression. Our parents and our grandparents might have come from very, very working-class stock. But our parents worked hard and they helped put us through university. We understand aspiration on this side of the House. You lot like to talk about it. We like to demonstrate it. We are the living embodiment of it. That's why we'll stand up for students. That's why we'll stand up for people who go to university. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you think this bill is going to do to someone who goes to work for a charity, for a community legal centre, in a low-paid occupation? Do you think there's going to be an incentive to work in the community sector? Why would people do it? They're already going to take a discount on wages. Why would you punish them further by taxing them, by making further higher education contributions required so that you can just gather a little bit more money from them, even though they're working in that lower paid occupation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we won't stand for it. We'll stand up for aspiration. We'll stand up for people who want to go to university. We'll stand up for low-paid working people, because they deserve champions, and they will have them in this place as long as Labor is here. We will stand up for working people, and that includes people who went to university. It also includes vocational education. It also includes making sure that we do something about housing affordability. This government might be waging a war on young people, but young people will always have a voice in the Labor Party. The young people of Australia, who are this nation's future, will always have a voice. That's why we'll fight so hard on climate change. That's why we'll fight so hard for funding for vocational education and we'll stand up for public TAFE. That's why we'll always fight your cuts to university funding. That's why we'll always stand up against your cuts to the pension. And that's why we will oppose these amendments and this bill, because this bill punishes young people and it punishes lower paid workersâand you should be ashamed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  We don't agree with these amendments and we don't support the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, because it is one more example of this government's vandalism when it comes to education. This is a government that, just before Christmas, cut another $2.2 billion from our universities, not by taking it through the parliament and allowing us on this side to make clear our opposition to these university cuts but by pushing it through in the midyear economic update, just before Christmasâa $2.2 billion cut. All this government has done is make it harder for young Australians to get a university education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what do we want? We want every young Australian to have the opportunity, if they're prepared to work hard and study hard, to get a great educationâat university, at TAFE; it doesn't matter. But we know that most jobs of the future will require one of these. They will require either a university education or a TAFE education, and this government is wrecking both. It is wrecking universities, making them harder to afford and harder to attend, and it is wrecking TAFE, by ripping billions out of vocational education, apprenticeships and traineeships, including hundreds of millions in the last budget alone. We know that many Australians are already turning their backs on a university education because they just can't afford it. This week, just days ago, we heard that one in seven university students are regularly going without food, because they can't afford to study and eat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was speaking today to one of our major universities that says that a large proportion of the homeless young people in their city are university students who haven't got a place to live. We saw an article this week in The Conversation about young women in particular trading sex for accommodation, including students who were doing this. What are we doing to our young Australians that we are making it so impossible to make ends meet to invest their time and their energy in a university education that gives them hope for the future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredible that we are asking young people on lower and lower incomes to pay a larger share of their income, repaying their debt sooner. We know who this hits hardest. It hits people in lower paid jobs harder, because they will be spending a disproportionate amount of their income, that should be covering necessities, on repaying their education sooner. We know that most of these people will be women. These measures disproportionately affect women, and Labor has said so all along. Sixty per cent of all Australians with a HELP debt are women and two-thirds of the Australians impacted by these changes will be women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course our investment in education as a nation benefits the people who get the education. But those students, when they graduate, we hope go on throughout their professional lives to earn well and repay their debtânot just their HECS debt but their broader debt to society. Through their increased taxation as their wages increase they are supporting other young Australians to get a university education. Investment in education doesn't just benefit the individuals who receive the education; it benefits our nation. We know that Australia cannot be a wealthy and successful nation when we continue to cut university funding, as those opposite have done, and cut access to university education, as those opposite have done, by freezing university funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our investment in university education has a substantial economic return. Just today, we saw another report, commissioned by the Group of Eight universitiesâI think done by London Economicsâsaying that in 2016 $12 billion was spent on their universities and $66 billion was returned in economic growth through that investment. Research, discovery, innovation and learningâthe economic activity of the people who are working to supply the universities, particularly in our regional communitiesâmakes a huge difference.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="230886" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I rise to speak on these amendments. There are two points in particular that I would like to make. Firstly, I support the amendments that will be before us, and potentially discussed in a little bit more detail shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would like to say is that I am particularly keen to support the amendment that deals with the removal of the loan fees from students of the table B providers. In particular, that affects one of the universities in my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coastâthat is, Bond University. For some time I have worked with Bond University, with the Vice Chancellor, Professor Tim Brailsford, and with students at the university for the removal of the loan fees. It has been a contentious issue. I have fought long and hard to have those fees removed, so I'm absolutely delighted to support that amendment today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point that I would particularly like to make is in respect of vocational education. Let me start by saying that we are most definitely the party that is going to produce the results in the vocational education field. When Labor were in government, they absolutely decimated the sector. I've said before and I will say againâand I will continue to say itâthat Labor, when in government, brought vocational education in this country to its knees. They did that by significantly reducing employer incentives in the vocational education space, and apprenticeships in particular. Under the former Labor government, the number of apprentices that we had in training dropped dramatically. When I speak of apprentices, I am, of course, speaking of Australian apprenticeships, which include apprentices and trainees. This government has put $1.5 billion on the table to increase the number of apprentices that we have in training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are clearly some strong target areas that we need to look at, and we're working with a number of states. There are five states and territories that have signed on to the national partnership agreement: New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. We are continuing to work with them on the projects that they will be implementing to improve the number of apprentices that we have in training, not just in the coming year but for four years in total under the national partnership agreement, because this government recognises how important apprentices are to the future of Australia. So we'll be working with the states and territories in some targeted areas. We're certainly going to be looking at health, at ageing and at the disability sector. We'll also be looking at manufacturing, and we'll be looking at agriculture. We will work with every single state and territory to make sure that we are addressing the skills shortages that currently exist in this country and will continue to exist unless urgent action is taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when I say that we are the party that will stand up for vocational education, I can assure you that we have got the runs on the board, and we will continue to do that. It was just recentlyâmaybe six weeks ago or maybe eight weeks agoâthat one of the key stakeholders in the vocational education sector said to me that, for the first time, they can see the green shoots in vocational education, because, after such a long time in the darkness under Labor, we are now seeing some significant gains being made in that space. There is clearly more work to be done, but we have done a lot already to clean up the nightmare that we were left with when we took government.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apprentices are and will continue to be our target into the future, but we will continue to look holistically at education. I've said before in this place that we see education as a highway where you can start with early childhood and you can go through schools, you can go into vocational education and you can go into higher education. We will continue to strongly support education in this country to make sure that everyone has the opportunity for a quality education.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about education, one of the things that we must be mindful of at all times is ensuring that the education that we are providing to our young people, not just at school but through vocational education and in higher education, is of a high quality and that those coming through higher education or vocational education are, in fact, job ready and have the skills that industry is crying out for. This is what this government stands for: high-quality education at universities, at schools, in vocational training and in our early childhood centres. So what we will do is continue to take up the fight to make sure that our children in Australia have the opportunity for an ongoing high-quality education.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  Young people across this nation must look at this government and think, 'What did we ever do to you?' This government is trading off the future of young people time and time again across significant portfolio areas, making it more and more difficult for them, and it comes into this place with a bill like the one before us, which adds to that burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people in my communityâand, I'm sure, the communities of many of my colleagues across the boardâare facing challenges in getting, firstly, into post-secondary education opportunities. We know the impacts of the freeze on higher education funding and what that will do to universities and the offerings that they can make to students. We know that that will put pressure on them to decrease the opportunity to get a university qualification if that's where your interests and your ability lie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say I really admire the assistant minister's capacity to try and spin a good story out of what has been the devastation of the vocational education sector on the government's watch. She consistently says that this government is a serious friend of vocational education, but you've just got to look at the figuresâthe massive drop in the number of people undertaking vocational education, the huge decrease in the number of apprentices and trainees. It's like they've got one little lifeline that they cling to in this space, so the assistant minister constantly raises the fact that Labor cut back the employer incentives for traineeshipsânot for traditional apprenticeships. That was because there was a misuse of traineeships going on. If the government are critical of Labor's ensuring integrity in the provision of apprenticeships and traineeships, which is what we did with those changes, then I can only assume that they don't have any interest in the rigour and integrity of the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a couple of weeks ago, I was meeting with people involved in the TAFE sector about their concerns about the impact on diploma enrolments at TAFEs across the countryâacross electorates, like my ownâas a result, to a significant extent, of the changes that the government has made around the VET FEE-HELP loan arrangements. They're causing a real problem. We know that diplomas are right in that sweet spot where a lot of future career opportunities are going to lie. A lot of people, particularly those retraining or re-entering the workforce, and young people straight out of school, will go and do their certificate-level courses in areas where there's going to be huge job demandâaged care, child care, disability careâand then seek to add a diploma onto that. But we've seen a massive drop-off in diploma enrolments, something the government just doesn't have an answer for. It's the same with apprenticeships: there are over 140,000 fewer apprenticeships on their watch. If, as the shadow minister says, there was a problem with what Labor was doing, why have the government been digging the hole deeper? They haven't put in place a policy that has arrested, let alone reversed, that trend. And so, as we've seen, for young people across the board, post school, the pressures are mounting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then let's add in the cost of housing. I've had many young people, under 30, say to me, 'I don't think I'll ever own a home.' This is what young people say to you now. They're struggling to pay rent because the market is so competitive for them. So they've got those cost burdens on them. Then they're trying to support themselves while they're studying. Let's not even get into the incompetenceâhow long it takes to get youth allowance processed and actually get payments coming into your bank account. I've heard stories of people who are entitled to youth allowance going a whole semester with no income. Then the government say, 'We'll get rid of their penalty rates,' if they've got a job that they work on a Sunday so they can actually make ends meet. 'Yes, we'll get rid of those too.' Then, just to top it off, they bring this bill into the parliament and say, 'Even though you're earning as little as $42,000,' which is not a lot of moneyâas the shadow minister said, the idea of HECS is to pay it back when you're reaping the benefits of that investment; on $42,000, you'd be lucky to be keeping your head above waterâ'we're going to rip into you and take some money from you now.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no wonder that young people will be looking at this government, asking: 'When are you going to give us a go? When are you going to give us a future that we can look forward to?' And I haven't even touched on policy areas such as climate change or healthâtalk to young people about private health insurance. This government is completely out of touch with young people's needs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  We do not agree to these amendments. We do not agree to these amendments, and the reason is this: a few moments ago, the Prime Minister and his entire frontbench got up and walked out of the chamber, turning their back on this debate just as they are turning their back on the young people of Australia. They are turning their back on the young people of Australia. Make no mistake about it. From a government which has lectured Australians and the Australian Labor Party on the need for tax cuts, what this policy represents is a tax increase on young people at a time in their lives when they can least afford it.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are making it harder for students to get into university by increasing the tuition fees that they pay and by reducing the funding that is available to universities to support new students. They are making it harder for students to stay at university through a whole mix of policies, which the member for Cunningham has now just gone through. The fact is that it is harder for a young person to keep a job and to ensure that they're earning enough from that job, because of penalty rate cuts and because the jobs are not paying enough to keep pace with the cost of living increases. They are making it harder for them to get into university and stay in university, and they are making it harder for them to pay their debts once they have left university. That is why young people around the country are asking, 'What has this government got against us? They are loading us up with debt and making it harder and harder for us to meet those expenses when we leave university.' They have got nothing in their policy swag for the young people of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just part of the suite of education policies which are having a pernicious impact on young Australians. It goes hand in hand with the $17 billion worth of cuts to school education. These people over here think it is more important that we give big banks a $17 billion tax cut than it is to give a struggling public school or independent school assistance with their teaching, assistance with their school facilities and some additional funding to help struggling students meet their education needs now and into the future. It also comes hand in hand with their cuts to TAFE. I'm reliably informed that there are in excess of $3 billion worth of cuts to the TAFE system. So it's harder to go to school and harder to go to university. What are your options? Vocational education, generally. But this mob over here, with their born-to-rule attitude, are making it harder to get into TAFE as well by ensuring that they are cutting funding for TAFE and ripping the guts out of the vocational education system, with $2.2 billion worth of cuts across the vocational and higher education system. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Australia deserve better than what is on offer from this government. There used to be a time when the Prime Minister used to lecture Australians about the importance of being a smarter country. He used to tell us about how all Australians had an obligation to ensure that we pulled together and became a smarter country. You can't become a smarter country if you're ripping the guts out of the school education system, if you are ripping the guts out of the university system and if you are ripping the guts out of the vocational education system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">he message to the Prime Minister, the message to all of those backbenchers who are feeling very, very nervous indeed after the last round of by-elections, is to come back to this place and reject these amendments. They have a choice. They can stand by their Prime Minister and go down the gurgler with their Prime Minister or they can stand up for their electorates. They can stand up for the young people in their electorates and reject these amendments, reject the cuts to the vocational education system and the school education system, and say quite clearly to their Prime Minister, 'We do not support the tax cuts to big business or the $17 billion giveaway to big banks. Let's invest that money into schools, universities and the vocational education system. Let's put our priorities where they should be.' It's in the young people of this country. Not the big banks, not the big corporations. Let's get our priorities right. We can't become a smarter country if we're doing dumb things like this. </span>

It's a rotten day when you have to stand here in this parliament and defend higher education and the opportunities available to young people in this country. This should be a non-partisan matter. What happens to this country when we stop supporting higher education and stop supporting universities and the students that attend them, day in and day out, to get themselves a better life? This should be non-partisan. Why is it that the Liberal Party always pick off the low-hanging fruit? The low-hanging fruit for them is universities. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of universities around this country. I'm proud to have worked for one for about 10 years, at the University of Western Australia. It's where I learnt so many things. I was also an undergraduate there. Like many people on this side of the House, and I'm sure on the other side of the House, I'm the first in my family to graduate from a university. I was a state schoolkidâI went to Safety Bay Senior High Schoolâand I've got to say, in speaking for the first time at the despatch box as a shadow minister, I'm very proud to have been a state schoolkid and to be defending higher education and universities in this country. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I worked at the UWA for many years, and I've had a lot to do with the five universities in my state: Curtin University in Bentley; Murdoch University in South Street, close to my electorate and the member for Tangney's electorateâI don't see him speaking against the cuts to Murdoch University, which is desperately in need of good, adequate funding to help its research program; Edith Cowan University; and the private university, the University of Notre Dame Australia. The poor public universities need this funding to help the young people of Western Australia. A $2 billion cut to their income, to the competitive grant that they get, which is an effective freeze on places for Western Australian students in Western Australian universities, is denying Western Australian young people the opportunity to go to university. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has no idea how the university sector is funded. We heard the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, cry about the rivers of gold that he thinks universities have inherited over the last couple of years through the demand-driven system. What the demand-driven system did was allow more peopleâyoung people who would never have thought university was accessible to themâto go to university. That's what the demand-driven system, introduced by the Gillard government in this place, brought to the young people, to all people, of Australiaâgreater opportunities to go to university. And what does the current minister for education, Senator Birmingham, have to say about it? He calls it 'rivers of gold'. Well, go tell that to a vice-chancellor who has to spend several millions of dollars of their annual income trying to maintain things like, I don't know, libraries, museums or expensive art collections that they don't necessarily collect themselves but which have been gifted to them by people that are generous benefactors. They are great gifts to universities. These are some of the things universities have to maintain. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What should we have? Should we have 100-year-old institutions just crumbling to the ground so that these rivers of gold can go elsewhere? Why do the government ignore the fact that there's a cross-subsidy between research and education in this country? The reason we have a research-teaching nexus in universities in this country is so students who attend universities as undergraduates can learn from the best researchers in the country and in the world. That is of great benefit to all of us. The members on this side spoke about the Prime Minister's ridiculous and empty innovation agenda. We saw where that went. Where did it go? It just popped up, we had a nice couple of graphics that whirled around for a while, and then it all petered out. Do you know where the real innovation is happening? It's where the actual science is happening, and that's in universities. It is done by students, research students as well as undergraduate students, and their lecturers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we see today, which is going to bring down the threshold for when students have to pay back their HECS and HELP fees, is going to deny more people access to the greatest kind of education you can get. It's an amazing opportunity that this government are seeking to deny young people. It's an outrageous attack, and a continual, persistent and consistent attack, on young people in this country. The government just keep piling on the pressure on young people. They won't do anything about housing affordability. Oh, no, they won't do that. They won't do anything about penalty rates. Most young people are working in pubs and bars to try and make ends meet while they're at university, but they won't do a thing about penalty rates. Instead, the government are just going to make it harder for vulnerable people, for people from low-SES areas to go to university. That's a crying shame, and they should be ashamed of themselves.</span>

I thank the member for Brand for her contribution. She quite rightly paid particular attention to the fact that this Orwellian treatmentâso-called sustainabilityâof higher education is in some way supporting the university sector and supporting the ability of people to go to university and advance themselves in life. We know, on this side of the chamber, that this represents the most grievous attack not just on the universities but also on young people and people in the regions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the pleasure to representâas does my friend the member for BraddonâNorthern Tasmania, an area which historically has underperformed. There has been a lot of economic analysis as to what it is that holds back Northern Tasmania and Tasmania as a whole. Of course, the fact that the Tasmanian economy has significantly underperformed the equivalent economies even in regional Australia is something that has been the subject of economic analysis. One of the theories underpinning this is the fact that educational attainment, in particular higher educational attainment, is not keeping pace in Tasmania. So what we need is not less support for higher education and the higher education sector in areas like Northern Tasmania and other regional communities throughout Australia but more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thesis is that average incomes in the regions are significantly below those in urban communities. We have better educational attainment in the urban communities, while the regional parts of states, particularly in a state like Tasmania, suffer from lower educational attainment. And in the cities we see a greater representation of people who have graduated with higher degrees. It is reasonable to suggest that investment in educationânot denying investment in educationâis the way this parliament should proceed. We know, on this side of the House, that investment in higher education and education generally is an investment in the economy in the long term. This government, as I've said previously, has a one-point plan for the economy in Australiaâa one-point plan which involves shovelling $80 billion worth of money out the door, in particular to the big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there's a better way to proceed. We know it's not coincidental that the amount of money that is being invested in the tax cuts for the big banks is roughly the same that is being denied to education.</span>
                </p>

                    </a>  Thank you to the member for Bowman. He should know a conspiracy when he looks at it. The important thing is that the Labor Party, this side of politics, has recognised that investment in education is important, particularly for regional Tasmania. That's why, during the 2016 federal election campaign, we committed to the university transformation project in Northern Tasmania. We committed to the fact that we need to improve educational attainment in Northern Tasmania. We want to see higher education with better numbers of students graduating from university, higher incomes and higher productivity, particularly within the Tasmanian economy. Every small business in Northern Tasmania should aspire to the fact that they will have better productivity by paying their highly educated workforce more and, of course, improving the economic performance of their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there is no doubt that people recognise that universities represent a significant opportunity for economic growth. Recent studies suggest that the mere presence of higher numbers of university graduates in an economy significantly drives employment not just within the graduate cohort but within the wider workforce. What's the response of this government? The response of this government is to make it more difficult for people to attend university or, if they do attend university, they'll have a higher education debt, which they'll pay off earlier, because this government simply don't see our young people or our people in regional Australia having the opportunity to get ahead. We know that regional Australia, regional economies and the other states throughout Australia need this investment in higher education. It's vitally important that we push back, that we reject these amendments and that we reject this legislation. Thank you.</span>

                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I want to echo what has already been said about the appalling impacts of the substantive provisions of the legislation to lower the thresholds and make young people repay their education debt earlierâbut I'll touch on that in a moment. At the outset, I want to call out the appalling process that the government has gone through, which has been almost an abuse of the House. We have debated a version of this legislation twice at length. Sloppy reheated seconds came back when the government couldn't get the first go through, so they thought, 'We couldn't get $42,000 through; we'll try $45,000.' They shunted that off to the Senate. They read the writing on the wall that it was going to again fail in the Senate and die where it should've, and at the last minute they've cooked up a dodgy deal with the crossbench, which the House has not been briefed or advised on. We haven't had a moment to reflect on what it actually means. It's an appalling way to make education policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From what I've been told there is a second amendment. We are debating two amendments concurrently, and the debate so far has focused quite rightly on the awful impacts on young people in our communities, but the other amendment, which we're being told we have to debate and vote on concurrently, relates to extending loans to table B providers for private universities and removing loan fees for these institutions. That may be a good idea. I understand that Labor has an open mind to this. This is exactly the kind of issue we would publicly and transparently consider with consultation in a proper, grown-up policy process. All the government muppets who ran away from this debate are going to wander back in, stick their hands up and have no idea what they're actually voting on. In fact, hardly anyone in the House has any idea what we're voting on, because the government has done some dodgy deal with Senator Bernardi in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't understand the policy impacts or arguments around extending loans for table B providers for private universities. The extension of the loans in the system may have some value, but we have said that, in government, we would consider it in our national inquiry on post-secondary education, where everyone can have a say. It's probably old-fashioned, with the government's approach to making policy and legislation, to actually allow members to understand what they're voting on and put the detail in front of them; nevertheless, I think it is important that the House understands that we're voting on two very different things, one of which has never been part of the government's legislative proposal and has never been considered or debated in any sense by this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the other provision, the government's latest attempt to make life harder for young people, we hear from those opposite that lowering the repayment threshold, the income at which young people will be forced to repay their education debts, doesn't really matter, because it's just $5 or 10 bucks a week, not a lot of money. It might not be a lot of money to people in hereâto those opposite, who just awarded themselves a tax cut worth $7,000 when it fully rolls outâbut $5 is a lot of money to people in my community, to students struggling to make ends meet and put themselves through university while the government opposite cuts their penalty rates. On behalf of young people in my community I don't accept that $5 or $10 is a just little bit of money; it is significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to speak up on behalf of my electorate. During the last campaign I doorknocked more than 12,000 houses over 18 months and asked people, 'What matters most?' The No. 1 priority that kept coming back was education, whether I was talking to a young person thinking about their future, a grandparent worried about their grandkids, or a parent worried about how their kids are going to get to TAFE or university. Most particularly, migrants, who come to this country seeking a better life for their kids, with a laser-like focus on education. In the electorate that I've been proud to represent almost 60 per cent of people are born in another country. They come here, work hard and look for education. This bill takes us in the wrong direction. It makes it harder for young people to get into university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about our partners and friends in Asiaâour competitors in the coming decadesâthe OECD and everyone else say we should invest in two things: infrastructure and education. A smart country would be lowering barriers to education so that the brightest kid from the poorest family can have a chance to go to university. That was part of my family story. My mum left school at 15 in Footscray. Her family could not afford the uniforms to go to a school that offered year 12. My father, on the other hand, had the opportunity to pay his way through university. He failed a bit and just kept paying. That was seared into my consciousness: every kid, no matter their circumstances, should be able to go to university.</span>

The minister's response contained additional information which enabled the committee to conclude that, while certain measures in the plans do limit freedom of expression, they are nevertheless likely to be compatible with this right, because they are sufficiently circumscribed and are only as extensive as necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. This illustrates the constructive process of liaising with legislation proponents to identify relevant information in order to assist the committee in its assessment of legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018, which contains amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act to give force of law to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, known for convenience as the multilateral convention. The multilateral convention is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax agreements to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and to improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The proposal was announced by the government on 8 June 2017, at which point they announced that Australia had signed the multilateral convention and that they would introduce a bill to give the convention the force of law in Australia. The measure is estimated to give an unquantifiable gain to revenue over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The multilateral convention is just one of many action items in the OECD's and G20's base erosion and profit-shifting strategy to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational firms. The project was initiated by the G20 in 2012 and is headed by the OECD. Although Australia has adopted many of the multilateral convention's articles, it has not agreed to article 10, an anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions, also known as tax havens. It has not agreed to article 12, the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status through certain arrangements, despite an earlier Treasury paper indicating that Australia would adopt this article.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Labor are left in the position where, while we support the bill, we haven't received a clear indication from the government as to why they aren't supporting article 10 and article 12. Given the government's lack of action on multinational tax avoidanceâin particular, their lack of action on tax havensâwe're particularly concerned about the government's failure to agree to article 10. So I want to note now that the failure of the government to provide a clear rationale for not signing up to these two articles means that a future Labor government would use the resources of Treasury to explore the ramifications of not signing these two articles and consider whether or not that question would be revisited by a future Shorten Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the multilateral convention enters into force for Australiaâand subject to the entry into force for the relevant partner jurisdictionsâit will have the following impacts on Australia's existing tax agreements with partner jurisdictions: first, in respect of withholding tax on amounts paid or deemed to be paid by a nonresident on or after 1 January, occurring on or after the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and the partner jurisdiction; second, in respect of other taxes levied by Australia in relation to income profits or gains of any income year beginning on or after six months after the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and each of its relevant partner jurisdictions; and, third, in respect of the mutual agreement procedure and mandatory binding arbitration, generally the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and each of the relevant partner jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that parliament ratify the instrument, but I would draw the House's attention to the additional comments from Labor members and senators where they said that the committee process was 'constrained by inexplicably vague information provided in evidence from Treasury', relating to some revenue details.. The only non-Treasury submission to the committee process was the Tax Justice Network's. While overall supportive of parliament ratifying the instrument, they noted disappointment that the government had chosen not to support articles relating to tax havens. It's our understanding that if the bill isn't passed by the government's intended time frame of this month then a year of implementation would be missed. As such, Labor can assure parliament of our support for the expeditious passage of this bill through the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we debate in this place the issue of multinational tax avoidance, we do so in the broader context of my second reading amendment, noting that many of Australia's largest firms have paid no tax for the past few years. While inequality is high and rising and while this government has been cutting health funding and education funding, its priority still remains an $80 billion tax cut to big Australian firms, $17 billion of which goes to the big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australia is missing out on billions of dollars in tax revenue due to the government's failure to act on tax loopholes. Labor has a clear and costed plan and clear proposals on improving tax transparency, so the Australian people can see more tax being paid by multinationals and garner a clearer picture of exactly how multinational tax avoidance is affecting the public coffers. Labor has proposed public reporting of country-by-country reports which could help stem the flow of missing money. But we've seen from this Treasurer an unwillingness to close the loopholes. Corporate profits have soared. Australia's company tax rate is only in the middle of the G20 pack, and we now have the example of the United States, whose corporate tax cut has not flowed through to a significant increase in wage growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all of that, the government remains wedded to a big-business tax cut. They talk a big game on multinational tax, but their ads, in many cases, have cost more than their measures have actually raised. They've spent more on patting themselves on the back over multinational tax avoidance than they've raised through attempting to close loopholes. They were walking around claiming that their multinational tax laws had clawed back some $4 billion in multinational tax revenueâa claim which unravelled when it was revealed that the revenue was for tax years prior to the commencement of the government's multinational anti-avoidance law and their diverted profits tax. On 22 August 2017, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services claimed that, of that $4 billion 'about $2.9 billion came from just seven companies alone'. Labor legislation was being applied in all seven cases cited by Minister O'Dwyer. Specifically, the cases involved Labor's Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The coalition voted against these bills in both houses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That wasn't an isolated fib. There was extraordinary chutzpah from the Turnbull government when they tried to claim credit for the Australian tax office's victory over Chevron in the Federal Court by claiming their own piecemeal tax measures were 'working'. On the day of the Federal Court decision, Treasurer Morrison tweeted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Chevron will pay more than $300m to the ATO proving the govtâs program of tax avoidance funding and new measures is working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that he didn't tell his Twitter followers was that he voted against the very laws which secured that judgement against Chevron. If Treasurer Morrison had had his way, if the parliament had gone the way he voted, then those laws wouldn't have got up, and the Chevron decision wouldn't have gone through, because, in 2012, the coalition voted against the then Labor government's Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The Treasurer voted against it. The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services voted against it. Yet, when that very bill was used to secure a judgement against Chevron that improved the budget bottom line and slightly reduced the debt blow-out that is occurring under this government, the Treasurer and the minister for revenue didn't issue a mea culpa. They pretended to the Australian public that it was their laws which had secured that judgement. Their reason for voting against that 2012 loophole-closing bill was a claim that the law was retrospective, but, in reality, that law simply clarified the operation of our tax laws and made sure multinationals couldn't exploit loopholes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've also seen is that, as well as misrepresenting their own votes, the government have misrepresented Labor's votes. They've said that Labor voted against the multinational anti-avoidance lawâa simple mistruth. Labor never voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. What they may be confusing is Labor's voting against a dodgy deal between the Liberals and the Greens to water down tax transparency in Australia and take two-thirds of the private firms out of the tax transparency net by raising the threshold for tax transparency disclosure. I've got to say that, when I'm on my street stalls, I'm not besieged by constituents saying to me, 'The real problem is we have too much tax transparency in Australia!'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we first came towards the first reporting deadline, we saw a farrago of confused excuses from this government as to why we oughtn't have tax transparency. They said it was a form of red tape. They said it would create security concerns, raise the kidnap risk for those running private firms, while later admitting that they had received no advice on kidnap risk from security or policing agencies, leading one tax expert to describe the purported kidnap risk as, 'The stupidest excuse for non-disclosure', that he had ever seen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From this government we've seen an attempt to hide the truth from the Australian public about what big firms are paying. We've seen an attempt from this government to mislead the Australian people about their own record on multinational tax avoidance and about Labor's voting record in this place. Labor knows what needs to be done. We'll continue to lead the debate on multinational tax avoidance. If the Turnbull government were serious about tax fairness, it would adopt Labor's plan to close tax loopholes and crack down on tax evasion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's plan includes tightening debt deduction loopholes used by multinational firms, improving the budget by billions of dollars over the medium term. Labor's plan involves introducing public reporting of country-by-country reports, which is high-level information about where and how much tax was paid by large corporationsâthose with over $1 billion in global revenue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's tax plan involves providing protection for whistleblowers who report to the Australia Taxation Office on entities evading tax. Where whistleblowers information results in more tax being paid we would see them collecting a share of that tax penalty. It is not a radical idea, one which exists in an analogous form in the United States at the moment, and one which would ensure that we get greater compliance with our tax law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. That will allow everyone to find out who really owns our firms. Shareholders shouldn't be able to use complex structures and sham ownership to avoid complying with corporate transparency rules. Yet, the government has explicitly said that while at some point in the undefined future they might do something about a beneficial ownership register, it won't include trusts. That beneficial ownership register itself is nowhere in sight and the government is devoting paltry resources towards introducing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing mandatory shareholder reporting of tax haven exposure. If companies are doing business in a tax haven then they must disclose to shareholders that activity as a material tax risk. We would guide companies on which jurisdictions carry a material tax risk through a tax haven blacklist. Labor's multinational tax plan includes appointing a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation, ensuring community sector voices are heard in tax design and review processes. Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing public reporting of Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre data and requiring the annual public release of international cash flow data. Our plan would require government tenderers to disclose their country of tax domicile if they're bidding for government contracts worth more than $200,000. Those with particular tax domiciles wouldn't be ruled out, but we believe that it's appropriate that, if a firm is headquartered outside Australia, the Australian taxpayer is aware of where that tenderer is headquartered for tax purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's multinational tax plan develops guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds. Those guidelines will be developed by the Australian Taxation Office in collaboration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Labor's multinational tax plan would require that the Australian Taxation Office's annual report provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. Finally, Labor's multinational tax plan would deliver more tax transparency by restoring the original tax transparency thresholds. When Labor enacted tax transparency laws, under then Treasurer Wayne Swan and Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury, we had in place a $100 million threshold for both public and private firms. In a dodgy deal between the Liberals and the Greens political party, this was raised to $200 million for private firms. That had the effect of taking two-thirds of the private firms out of the tax transparency mix. While the Greens have belatedly backflipped on this, supporting our private senator's bill to restore a lower threshold for reporting, the government eventually gagged debate when that bill was returned to the House. If the government really cared about transparency, if they really cared more about making sure that Australians know what company tax is paid, rather than protecting their mates, then they would facilitate debate in this House on that bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals won't close tax loopholes. The Liberals won't crack down on tax havens. Since coming to office, the Liberals have cut over 4,000 staff from the Australian Taxation Office. Only Labor has a complete tax-haven plan. Only Labor can be trusted to get tough on multinational tax avoidance.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  It's my absolute pleasure to second the amendment and to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018. The government's Treasury website states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is leading the global fight against multinational tax avoidance and is cracking-down on taxpayer tax evasion with a number of reforms announced as part of the 2016-17 Budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, how can that actually be possible when one in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax in the last three years? Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison say they've been cracking down on tax avoidance, yet we know their true tricky priority is looking after their buddies in big business. They are not only not cracking down on tax avoidance but indeed are giving them a further $80 billion tax cut. What a joke. There's no way that Australia's biggest money-makers aren't contributing to our nation's tax reserves! But unfortunately that is precisely the case. In 2015-16, 17 of the top 50 companies paid no corporate tax, leaving just 33 to shoulder that burden. Between them, they provided just under $20 billion worth of tax. Interestingly, the Prime Minister's old employer, Goldman Sachs, is among these. While it had revenues of at least $1.8 billion over the last three years, with an operating profit in each of those years, it paid zero dollars of corporate tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is being deprived of billions in tax revenue, thanks to loopholes that the Turnbull government refuses to act on, despite Labor's alternative of tax transparency laws showing just how the people of Australia are losing. There are numerous studies and analyses that show the extent to which multinational tax avoidance prevents national governments and their citizens from receiving the funds they are due. This in turn inevitably means the tax burden falls unfairly on domestic companies and individuals, that global inequality is sharpened, and that public goods and services are not funded or delivered. We know that fair taxation is an essential element of a well-managed domestic and global economy. It is both inefficient and indeed immoral when companies play tricky, complicated games in order to avoid contributing their fair share to societyâthe society from which they derive their existence and indeed their profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor in our policy on properly assessing and taxing, could help stem the flow of missing money. The Treasurer, on the other hand, doesn't want to get his boys in big business offside and doesn't want to close these loopholes. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate actually places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy he has is a big-business tax cut. The government continues to talk a big game on multinational tax, yet to date it has failed to actually deliver any significant results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The multilateral convention that we are here to discuss as part of this legislation today is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax agreements to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and improved dispute-resolution mechanisms. The multilateral convention is one of many action items of the OECD in the G20's base erosion and profit shifting strategies to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational companies. This is indeed a global effort and global push, but one that it seems the Turnbull government doesn't want to wholly sign up to. The multilateral instrument will enable jurisdictions to swiftly modify their bilateral tax treaties to implement measures designed to better address multinational tax avoidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although Australia has adopted the majority of the convention's articles, there are two major components that for some reason this government has decided not to agree to. The first is article 10, an anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions, which is a euphemistic way of saying tax havens. This article denies treaty benefits where an entity that is a resident of a jurisdiction party to a bilateral tax agreement derives certain income from other jurisdictions. The Tax Justice Network is opposed to this decision of government. It believes the Australian government should adopt article 10 without reservation to further deter the use of secrecy jurisdictions to avoid paying tax. The OECD notes this particular article was intended to address:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ potential abuses that may result from the transfer of shares, debt-claims, rights or property to permanent establishments set up solely for that purpose in countries that offer preferential treatment to the income from such assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The network is deeply disappointed this government has not adopted the article as it provides a loophole for big business to continue to avoid taxation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second article that this government has refused to adopt from the treaty is article 12. The intention of this article was to ensure where an intermediary habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principle role in concluding substantially finalised business contracts in a jurisdiction on behalf of a foreign enterprise that arrangement would be deemed to constitute a permanent establishment. A permanent establishment is a taxable presence threshold for determining whether a jurisdiction can tax business profits derived by a foreign resident enterprise. This means, potentially, a foreign enterprise can avoid local taxation of business profits by implementing arrangements that circumvent the existing treaty based definition of a permanent establishment. The Tax Justice Network, again, have told us that they are deeply disappointed that the Australian government has decided to not adopt this provision, which is a reversal of their initial position. The network believes that this article would have assisted in further curbing foreign multinational entities from seeking to artificially avoid creating a permanent establishment. This, in turn, will prevent the government from taxing these businesses profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these obvious flaws, Labor do support the treaty action overall. But we observe that this government has done virtually nothing to address the key issue of multinational tax avoidance through the refusal to take up these two critical articles. Even from opposition, Labor has been alone in carrying forward the vital policy work and policy arguments on this vital issue of multinational tax avoidance. Back in 2015 Labor proposed a comprehensive multinational tax package that included a number of measures specifically designed to address the scourge of debt deduction loopholes. This alone would have added $5.4 billion to the budget bottom line over a decade. Elements of this proposed package included the adoption of worldwide gearing ratios to address the issue of thin capitalisation; the implementation of a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian legal entities, including trusts, as per the G20 principles that Australia has adopted; and the restoration of $100 million as the tax transparency threshold in relation to the public reporting of tax data for private companies. It would also have appointed a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation and delivered increased compliance funding for the Australian Taxation Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the Turnbull government talk a big game on multinational taxation, but they've spent more on spruiking their laws than the legislation has actually directly raised, continuing the coalition's form of neglect of this pressing reform area. In 2012 the coalition opposed Labor's tax law amendment on cross-border transfer pricing, which, after passing, was integral to the ATO's recovery of some $300 million from Chevron. There are numerous studies and analyses that show the extent to which multinational tax avoidance prevents national governments and their citizens from receiving the funds that they are fairly due. This in turn leaves the tax burden on domestic business and on individuals in each nation. This result serves only to heighten global inequality and the lack of funding available for the vital services needed in our community for our citizens, for our people. Labor regards fair taxation as an intrinsic and essential element of a well-managed domestic and global economy. It is both inefficient and, as I said before, immoral when companies are able to play the game, use the loopholes, and put their funds and run their profits through tax-avoidance centres instead of paying their fair share under the tax regime that should fairly apply in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were serious about tax fairness, it would adopt Labor's plan to close loopholes and crack down on tax havens; it would tighten debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies, which would improve the budget bottom line by billions of dollars; it would introduce public country-by-country reporting of tax information specifically about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations; and it would provide protection for whistleblowers who report tax-evading entities to the ATO. We believe these whistleblowers should be rewarded where information provided by them results in more tax being paid, allowing them to collect a share of that tax penalty. Let's make sure we get the real word on what's happening. The joint parliamentary committee report was unanimous in its view as to the changes that we should see to whistleblowing laws here in Australia and, once again, the government squibbed on its proposed changes to whistleblowing legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to introduce a publicly accessible register for the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. This will provide transparency. It will allow anyone to find out who the real owners of our firms are and to see if they are complying with tax requirements and laws, instead of using these structures to avoid taxation. The government should introduce mandatory shareholder reporting of tax-haven exposure. Companies must disclose to shareholders as a material tax risk if a company is doing business in a tax haven, because there are real risks for the ongoing profitability of those companies where they do this contrary to what not just should be the law of this country but is the law of many others. The government should get on with appointing a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation to ensure community views are heard in tax design and review processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it should be introducing public reporting of AUSTRAC data and requiring the annual public release of international cashflow data. But there's more the government could and should do. They should require government tenderers to disclose their country of tax domicile. All firms tendering for government contracts worth over $200,000 could be made to state their country of domicile for tax purposes. Given we'll provide them with taxpayer dollars, it probably makes sense to know where those dollars will end up. The government can develop guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds. They could require the ATO to annually provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. They could deliver more tax transparency by restoring Labor's $100 million threshold for public reporting of tax data by private companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this bill, but we note it is still deficient in the way in which the government has signed up to this treaty. Without the resources of Treasury we're not in a position to know precisely why the government declined to adopt the treaty in full but, under a Shorten Labor government, we will review that decision. We want to best understand why the government is doing what it's doing. Why is it not signing up to ensure we have the tightest of tax laws in this country, to ensure we don't have leakage, to ensure we have the revenues we need to provide the services our community badly needs and in fact deserves? We will also, as it would seem we are left to, continue to lead the debate on multinational tax avoidance, because we know that when multinationalsâor indeed anyoneâdon't pay their fair share of tax, the rest of us are left to pick up the tab. That's not fair to the Australian taxpayer or the Australian community, and it would seem that the government is quite happy to not be fair.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I'm speaking in support of the amendment moved by the member for Fenner. The Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018 contains amendments to the tax agreements act to give the force of law in Australia to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. Labor does support this bill, subject to the amendment that's been moved by the member for Fenner. But we note that the government has declined to adopt two of the articles in the convention that are designed to deter the use of tax havens. Under a Shorten Labor government we will review the decision not to sign up to those parts of the treaty, utilising the resources of Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at the detail of the bill, the multilateral convention is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax arrangements. This helps to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The multilateral convention is one of many action items of the OECD's and the G20's base erosion and profit shifting strategy to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational companies. The project was initiated at the G20 in 2012 and is headed by the OECD. Although Australia has adopted the majority of the multilateral convention articles, it has not agreed to a number of key aspects. They are article 10, which is the anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictionsâor tax havens, as they are more commonly knownâand article 12, which covers artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status through certain agreements. I want to note that, without a clear rationale from the Turnbull government about their refusal to sign these tax haven measures, a future Shorten Labor government, if we are elected at the next election, would utilise the resources of Treasury to explore the ramifications of not signing these two articles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to tackling multinational tax avoidance, it's Labor that's been leading the way, with the Turnbull government following in our wake. One in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax for at least the past three years. There's a lot of anger and resentment out there at the moment in the community about many of these corporations. We've seen that in the approach that many people have taken to the banking royal commission and to the disclosure of the amount of tax that big companies actually pay in this country and the enormous deductions that they're able to use to basically reduce their taxable income and in some cases pay no tax at all. It should never be forgotten that it was Labor that originally established these tax transparency rules to oblige those companies to disclose the amount of payments they are making to governments through the taxation system. And it was the coalition that got into bed with the Greens and watered down those tax laws. They reduced the number of companies that are subject to the law and therefore have to report on an annual basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government claims that they're about tax transparency. But in practice they're actually doing the opposite, reducing the amount of transparency and the number of companies that need to disclose the tax that they pay to the Australian government. We all know that this government's priority at the moment is an $80 billion tax break for the biggest companies throughout the country. They want to give a tax cut to some of the largest corporations in Australiaâwhich include those big banks that have done such a wonderful job by the Australian people over the course of the last decade! As we're seeing in the royal commission, they've been such great backers of Australian small businesses, farmers, and families and have been so generous in their approach to their insurance arms, to their wealth management arms and to disclosure and transparency! Yet this government wants to give those sorts of organisations and the people who run those organisations, and their shareholders, a tax cut. Well, Labor simply won't stand for it. We've had enough of these organisations ripping off the Australian people, being deceitful, being dishonestâsending farmers, small businesses and families to the wallâand getting a tax cut. It's not on, and we're going to stand up for those hardworking small businesspeople, the farmers, Australian workers and their families, and oppose this government's dastardly attempts to give those organisations a tax cut. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is also missing out on billions in tax revenue thanks to loopholes that the Turnbull government refuses to act on, despite Labor's tax transparency laws showing just how much the people of Australia are losing. The introduction of key public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Laborâin particular in the resources and extractive industries such as mining, oil and gasâcould help stem the flow of missing tax revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's also leading the way in ensuring that large Australian resources companies are good corporate citizens and maintain accountability and transparency through systems that not only ensure they pay their fair share of tax but help combat corruption, particularly in countries where they're operating offshore mining and resources projects, many of them in our backyard in the Pacific. Our policy will require large extractive companies to disclose payments arising from any activity involving exploration, prospecting, discovery, development and extraction. Disclosure under the regime will be on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. Payments to be disclosed include taxes on income; production and profits of companies; royalties; dividends; signature discovery and production bonuses; fees, including licence fees, rental fees and entry fees; other payments, licences and concessions; payments for infrastructure improvements; and production entitlements such as profit resources. Payments must be disclosed if they are made to any national, regional or local authority of the country, including a department, agency or state-owned enterprise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disclosure under this regime should apply to large extractive companies in Australia. A large company shall be defined as a company that meets at least two of the following criteria: it has a balance sheet total that exceeds $50 million, its net turnover on the balance sheet date exceeds $100 million or the average number of employees during the financial year to which the balance sheet relates exceeds 250. A single or series of related payments within a financial year must be disclosed if the payments amount to at least $150,000. A mandatory reporting regime for extractive industries will increase the availability of verifiable, disaggregated information from company financial reports regarding payments made to governments, and this information would build public accountability and trust in companies and governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Shorten Labor government, if we're elected, will also establish a multistakeholder committee to work with the government on the implementation of the reporting regime, including defining project-level reporting and the establishment of an online reporting mechanism to ensure public transparency and accessibility. The legislation would include equivalency provisions so that companies captured by other jurisdictions due to cross-listing on stock exchanges would only be required to lodge one report. If we're elected, the extractive industries transparency regime will require subjected companies to begin reporting payments in 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In line with consultation from interested stakeholders, this policy mirrors as closely as possible the UK scheme and the equivalent provisions contained therein. Our policy, if we are elected, will ensure that extractive companies are among the most transparent and accountable in the world. Our companies will be adopting best practice when it comes to ensuring that they're disclosing payments to government and they're transparent, accountable and combatting corruption in the countries in which they operate. Improved transparency and accountability in extractive industries is an effective mechanism to combat corruption in developing and developed countries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it's clear that the Turnbull government doesn't want to close some of the corporate tax loopholes that exist. Some of those relate to tax havens that are part of the OECD and the G20's base erosion and profit shifting agenda. That's evident in the fact that they're not signing up to that article contained in that plan. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy that they have is one for a big business tax cut, not further transparency, and that's simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor is proposing to look at those additional two articles that the government hasn't signed up to, and that's why we're proposing and promising that if we're elected we'll go further, with additional transparency and accountability, particularly in the resources and extractive industries, on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. I urge all members to support the very sensible amendment that has been moved by the member for Fenner.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="LKU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I listened carefully to the speech of the member for Kingsford Smith on the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018, and I was a little disappointed to find that it was devoid of so many facts. So, I appreciate the opportunity to now set the record straight when it comes to the government's commitment to tackling multinational anti-avoidance of tax. If a multinational corporation makes money in Australia, it is right they pay tax in Australia. The Turnbull government has introduced new laws to close loopholes, to ensure that profits are taxed here. The Turnbull government is absolutely determined to make sure that everyone is paying the right amount of tax, and large multinationals must pay their share. Deliberate tax avoidance will not be tolerated, and tax cheats will be tracked down and will face the full force of the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the Turnbull government have taken strong action and introduced tough new laws, Labor, by contrast, when they were in government, did virtually nothing to combat tax avoiders, and in opposition they opposed our Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and the introduction of the country-by-country reporting regime. Paying tax is not optional. The Turnbull government will ensure that multinational companies pay the tax that they owe in Australia. As a result of our new laws, more money will be invested here, benefitting our community and helping guarantee the essential services and infrastructure that Australians rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the fact-free contribution by the member for Kingsford Smith, I'd like to place on record that, since the government established the Tax Avoidance Taskforce, the Australian Taxation Office has raised around $7 billion in income tax liabilities against large public groups and multinationals. The Australian Taxation Office has collected $4.1 billion in cash, with $3.1 billion of that amount from multinational enterprises. Of that $3.1 billion, the Australian Taxation Office has collected over $1 billion from ecommerce companies. The government's coordinated plan to tackle profit shifting and avoidance of Australian tax law will keep paying dividends as well. The Australian Taxation Office confirms that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law alone has seen additional sales income of $7 billion each year now being returned in Australia. Furthermore, hundreds of millions of dollars of additional GST revenue is now being paid. The Australian Taxation Office has publicly indicated that there is a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government and not supported by those opposite. In fact, Australia is leading the way in combatting multinational tax avoidanceâno thanks to those who are not trying to find solutions to the problems that we have identified and tackled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would, though, like to thank those who have made a contribution to this debate. This bill will help Australia to quickly and efficiently modify the majority of Australia's bilateral tax treaties to bring them into line with international best practice when it comes to tackling multinational tax avoidance. It will complement the other measures implemented by the government to enhance tax system integrity, including the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, country-by-country reporting and the diverted profits tax. The multilateral instrument is a unique tool that is expected to update more than 1,100 bilateral tax treaties worldwide. At present, based on the known positions of other jurisdictions, the multilateral instrument will modify 31 of Australia's 44 existing bilateral treaties. Modifying these treaties through the multilateral instrument will save time and expense, significantly, for Australia, compared to the alternative of bilaterally renegotiating each treaty to achieve similar outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The multilateral instrument will ensure that multinational entities are no longer able to exploit Australia's bilateral tax treaties in order to avoid paying tax. Additionally, the multilateral instrument will provide greater certainty for taxpayers by strengthening current tax treaty related dispute resolution procedures. Australia has committed to working closely with its treaty partners to resolve treaty related tax disputes through the multilateral instrument. Where both treaty partners agree, taxpayers will also have access to independent and binding arbitration, thereby allowing disputes to be resolved more quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking to the future, the government will continue to work with the G20 and the OECD bilaterally to ensure that the international tax system operates as efficiently, fairly and effectively as possible. The multilateral instrument clearly demonstrates the benefits of international cooperation, and the government encourages other jurisdictions to adopt it to the fullest extent possible. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEAY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  Thank you for the opportunity again to speak on the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017, as I only had a minute yesterday. In continuation, I want to stress from the outset that this bill will actually mean a loss of hundreds of thousands of seafarer jobs in this country. Many of those could potentially be from my electorate. I'm from an island state which is predominantly an export state, and a number of shipping companies could potentially be at risk from this bill. It will mean that foreign ships and foreign crews could come in and take over some of the destinations and the work undertaken by Australian crews and Australian ships. We've seen it before with this government when it's been issuing permits left, right and centre that have resulted in hundreds of Australian jobs being lost, replaced by foreign workers. I've heard the Prime Minister say time and time again, 'The government is the friend of the worker.' Well, not when it comes to the maritime industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was born into a seafaring family. My father was a seafarer. He was a steward on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Princess of Tasmania</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Empress of Australia</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Abel Tasman</span>, where he passed away at sea while I was quite young. These vessels were largely passenger ships bringing visitors to and from Tasmania. Much like the current <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of Tasmania</span> ships, they also had a large freight component.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to share with the chamber what a local seafaring job means to people in my electorate. I have a number of ports in my electorate, probably more than any other electorate in Tasmania, so there are many, many people that are supported by the shipping industry in Tasmania. Being from an island state that is absolutely reliant upon Bass Strait shipping, Tasmanians have a strong cultural affinity with the sea and with Bass Strait. Maritime operations are central to life in my electorate of Braddon and are vital to the Tasmanian economy. Like many in my home town of Devonport, Bianca, whose husband works as a seafarer, saw the crew from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alexander Spirit</span> when it was docked in Devonport in 2015âwe have just celebrated the third anniversary of that dispute. The crew were told they would be sacked and replaced when the ship next docked in Singapore. This action has had a profound effect on her family and puts a human face on what it would mean, should this government have its way. Bianca told me: 'I lay awake at night, worried about my husband's job, worried that he and his shipmates are going to be replaced with a foreign crew, without warning. The current coastal shipping laws mean some security for my family. It means that my children, as proud Australians, will have a chance to go to sea, just like generations of my family have done before me.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 99 per cent of Tasmania's freight volumes are moved by sea. The timely and efficient movement of passengers and goods to the mainland not only mean hundreds of local jobs but also supports important industries in tourism, agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, and the mining and manufacturing sectors. The most recent data from Tasmania's Department of State Growth states that over 12.5 million tonnes of freight is moved through Tasmania's publicly owned ports. An additional 2.4 million tonnes of freight is move through Port Latta, which is in my electorate. Tasmania's freight task is a mix of bulk commodities, at 65 per cent, and containerised freight, at 35 per cent. Eighty per cent of Tasmania's sea freight is for interstate trade, 17 per cent is for international exports, and a small amount is direct overseas freight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our containerised freight task is also seasonal. For imports, volumes increase in the spring and early summer. For exports, volumes increase between the summer and late autumn, driven by agricultural production. Tasmania is well serviced by three Australian owned and crewed shipping companies: Toll, SeaRoad and TT-Line. Just last week Toll Shipping announced its two new Bass Strait freighters are expected to start operating on 1 March next year. My local Burnie newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span>, reported that this is part of a $311 million spend, which the Melbourne headquartered company said would significantly increase shipping capacity between Tasmania and the mainland and support economic growth and rising demand for Tasmanian produce. The vessels set to operate between Melbourne and Burnie are being purpose-built at a cost of $170 million. The project also includes $141 million to upgrade terminals, wharves and berthing facilities at both ports. Toll Group managing director, Michael Byrne, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the largest ever investment by a logistics business in the Bass Strait, and underpins Toll's commitment to the Australian domestic market and the Bass Strait trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another Bass Strait operator, SeaRoad Shipping, launched its $110 million <span style="font-style:italic;">Searoad Mersey II</span> vessel in 2016, which lifted the operation's capacity by 62 per cent. They also have plans to replace the <span style="font-style:italic;">Searoad Tamar</span>. All of this investment and the hundreds of jobs it supports would be placed at risk by this bill. That is unacceptable to me and to the people in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tasmanian Integrated Freight Strategy</span> contains the following statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmaniaâs freight system underpins business and economic growth in the state. â¦ It also equips our economy to optimise growing national and international demand for Tasmanian products. A reliable freight system is critical to Tasmanian businesses retaining and accessing new markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would think the ears of those opposite should be pricking up on this kind of language.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A large proportion of Tasmanian sea freight is also time-sensitive, reinforcing again the need for reliable shipping services. This time-sensitive task is especially important to Tasmania's agriculture and aquaculture industries. These are high-value products and include seafood, cherries and berries. Currently, there is no dataset that comprehensively defines or quantifies the time-sensitive freight market. However, the Tasmanian government, through Infrastructure Tasmania, has recently completed a report examining production volumes and potential market growth across 28 time-sensitive freight commodities, including salmon, potatoes and frozen meat. The findings of this report are significant when you give consideration to future freight volumes and a vital need for a regular and reliable shipping services. The review found that even under a modest growth scenario the time-sensitive freight segment is forecast to increase by 43 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I trust the House now understands how vital a regular and reliable shipping service to Tasmania is. This government has destroyed Australia's car manufacturing industry, and now it seems that this government is determined to destroy Australia's coastal shipping industry and, more broadly, our maritime industry. I have listened intently and I'm yet to hear one member on the opposite side say the magic words, 'I support the Australian shipping industry, Australian ships, Australian crews and Australian jobs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with so many other pieces of legislation that come into this place, this government has form. A previous bill that sought to deregulate the Australian domestic shipping industry resulted in replacing Australian ships with foreign ships and replacing Australian crews with cheap overseas labour. Tasmanian-owned shipper SeaRoad said at that time that they could be forced to replace local crews with foreign workers. SeaRoad was also concerned that that bill would ultimately lead to reduced services and increased prices. The government's own modelling from that bill anticipated that four of the six ships serving the Bass Strait would be foreign-flag vessels if that bill was passed. Fortunately, the Senate saw the multiple flaws in that piece of legislation and rejected it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with the failure of that bill, a dozen Australian ships have been reflagged as foreign ships, replacing Australian crews with overseas labour. I put this test to every member sitting opposite who intends to support this bill: go and speak to one of the many, many workers on the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alexander Spirit</span>, who were sacked at the stroke of the pen by Senator Abetz, which meant that those ships were going to be sent off, replaced by a foreign ship with a foreign crew. Many of those workers, including in your state, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, have yet to find other work. The crew of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alexander Spirit</span>, while docked in Devonport, were told they would lose their jobs when the vessel next docked in Singapore. While this ultimately did happen, I was heartened to see the strong community support for the crew of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alexander Spirit</span>. Those crew members were not local to my home town, where that dispute took place. They were from across the country, but the community stood beside them. Braddon voters, Tasmanians and Australians do not want to see Australian jobs going to overseas workers. This is what this bill would do, and those sitting opposite who vote for this are potentially sacking hundreds of seafarers and replacing them with foreign workers doing exactly the same job as the Australian workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that; this bill places more risk on our fuel security and our national security. To some members opposite, these are important factors that they support at any other time of the week. If they vote for this bill, to me it's just an ideological attack on maritime workers and the industry and any future notional support from those opposite to espouse national fuel security as something they care about is just a hollow, insincere gesture. If those opposite are truly concerned about fuel security, as I know the member for Canning isâhe's the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Securityâand Liberal Senator Jim Molan, they should cross the floor and not support this bill. It's that simple. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will explain a little bit further. I've spent a lot of my time outlining why a regular and reliable shipping service is critical to Tasmania. I would have thought that to give the Australian shipping industry confidence the government would want to achieve bipartisan support. In fact, in the minister's own discussion paper for this bill he said that bipartisan support is essential. On this count alone he has failed. This bill allows temporary-licence foreign-flag vessels to significantly vary their freight volumes and the days they are carrying the domestic freight, at the same time making it almost impossible for an Australian general-licence ship to contest those movements. This means that Australian shippers simply won't know what is being carried until after the event. In effect, this means that any half-smart foreign operator and 'compliant' local freight company can game the system to use foreign-flag ships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is also disappointing is that despite the minister making a commitment to consult on this bill, he did not do this appropriately. Australia's peak shipping industry body, Maritime Industry Australia Ltd, was not invited to the consultation sessions on this bill. MIAL's membership includes Toll, SeaRoad, ANL, North West Shelf Shipping Services Company and BP Shipping to name just a few. No other Australian maritime businesses, except Carnival Australia, which is a cruise ship operator, were invited. How can you possibly consult on shipping changes without speaking to the actual shipping companies? It was almost as if the minister wanted to consult in an echo chamber, where the sounds he heard were the ones he wanted. If he had consulted with MIAL, he would have heard thisâand I quote from MIAL's media release from September last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there is nothing in the Bill to assist Australian shipowners compete with foreign ships that have all but unfettered access to coastal trades. We held low expectations on that front and unfortunately haven't been disappointed there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a damming indictment of this bill from Australia's peak shipping industry body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following discussions with SeaRoad, I understand Bass Strait may currently have some protections. There is only one temporary licence available for Bass Strait. If one was issued from Devonport to Melbourne or Bell Bay to Melbourne, SeaRoad would be able to object and stop it. Similarly, Toll could do the same from Burnie to Melbourne. However, I invite the government to provide Tasmanian shippers with an assurance that this will continue, because I am concerned that, if this bill passes, Bass Strait may be opened up more widely to temporary-licence vessels. I am advised that this could be the case. If this is the case, how can potentially opening up Bass Strait to the whim of foreign shipping companies achieve the Tasmanian Liberal government's own objective of a reliable shipping service? What measures will the government put in place to prevent foreign shippers cherry-picking Tasmania's peak periods, thus undermining existing Australian owned shippers? What guarantee can the Prime Minister give to ensure Tasmania is serviced by Australian flagged shippers? I look forward to receiving these answers, and I will be on it until I get those answers. But there are so many other reasons why Labor will not support this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  Welcome back to the member for Braddon. I'm not sure how much you've learnt in the time you've been away, but I was interested to listen to that long list of great Tasmanian products that you are very confident about growing, and I know the Hodgman government is very confident about the growing agricultural sector in Tasmania. But it seemed to me that you were very focused on the jobs of MUA workers and very poorly focused on the jobs of those who work in agriculture. There is repeated evidence that the Australian coastal shipping trade runs at roughly four times the cost of the international trade, and that will be worn by the Tasmanian industries that you're so very proud of and that I'm keen to see succeed as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You also touched on fuel supplies. If we lose the coastal shipping trade, there is not one Australian registered tanker. There is not one tanker. Every voyage has to be offered up to the market and then it is passed by, which is a two-day delay, and then it is given to international shipping. So, unfortunately, you are defending something that has virtually passed us by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember that we debated this bill in 2012. The member for Grayndler, then the minister, brought in the platform that we are living on now. He was very keen to give his mates in the MUA a good run. At the time, there were 22 Australian registered vessels. That was down from 55 six years before. Now, as it was then, the fleet remains old by world standards. We are the fourth-largest user of shipping in the world, but for most of the tasks we are served by a competitive world practice. But, if you're an Australian business needing Australian supplies, it's a whole different world. It's roughly four times the cost and a whole lot of red tape. This bill seeks to streamline, to speed up, the permit system. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, when then Minister Albanese brought in the current act, he said it was designed to ensure the Australian shipping industry survived. In 2012 there were 30 ships. In 2018 there are 13. That reduction was under the act that the member for Grayndler said would protect Australian shipping. There was a reduction in deadweight capacity, over those six years, of more than 65 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The average age of the registered fleet, all 13 of themâthere are 13 registered under the Australian flagâis 24, up from 23 last year. The oldest vessel is 26 years old and the youngest is two. There is one vessel that is only two years old. But, if you remove the two-year-old vessel from that list, every other vessel is at least 17 years old, and the average age goes up to 26. This is a very old fleet by world standards. In fact, the world standard is around 13 years old. It's 13, and we've got a fleet servicing Australia that is 26 years old. The largest vesselsâand this is interestingâthose over 10,000 tonne deadweight, are all over 19 years old. Sadly, in June, CSL's <span style="font-style:italic;">Iron Chieftain</span>, used to bring coal to Whyalla, suffered a fire on board. While it is still actually registered, it has been retired. The<span style="font-style:italic;"> Iron Chieftain</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>was our largest vessel, at 50,600 tonnesânot too bad a size. The next largest vessel we have surviving in the trade is 27,700 tonnes. So it's a 20-year-old fleet, when the world average is 13. I'm glad the member for Grayndler has just walked in, because it is his act that has brought us to this stage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How strong a message do we need? We are still protecting, basically, a dying species. There are 13 ships left in the trade. When will we wake up and realise that the horse has expiredâor perhaps, a bit more like Monty Python, that the parrot is dead? Electorates like mine are in the firing line. Nyrstar in Port Pirie; GRA in Thevenard, out west of Ceduna; Liberty OneSteel in Whyallaâthey are all users of coastal shipping. The best way to avoid this overly expensive and antiquated fleet is to import product as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of addressing that bill in 2012, I brought up the issues for GRA, west of Ceduna. It is cheaper, as it was then, to bring gypsum in from South-East Asia to Brisbane and to Sydney than it is to ship it around the Australian coastâbasically, from just west of Adelaide, to Sydney and Brisbane. It's four times the distance, but it's cheaper to bring it on the overseas fleet. I'm even hearing stories at the moment of companies talking about shipping their goods to Indonesia and then bringing them back again so they can avoid the coastal shipping trade. This is an incredible inefficiency that we are visiting upon our industries.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I touched on oil tankers; we don't even have an oil tanker. There is not an oil tanker registered in Australia. Yet, if the refinery companies want to shift fuel up and down the coast, they have to put that out to tender on the Australian marketâonly to find no-one tendersâand then they can go to the international market. Talk about ridiculous red tape. We need to let this system evolve to reflect the Australia that we are living in at the moment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also raised, in 2012, the cost of demurrage. I haven't checked the figures again, but I don't imagine they're much different today from what they were then. Demurrage is $10,000 a day. That is when a ship is lying off-port, at anchor, waiting to get into the loading dock. It's $10,000 a day for an international ship and $37,000 a day for an Australian registered ship. That's enormous! That is an enormous difference. Essentially, we are inflicting extra cost on our fully Australian industriesâthose employing Australian labour, as the member for Braddon talked about; those that are giving a leg up, an opportunity, to our kids. We are imposing extra costs on them to protect an ever-dwindling number of jobs in the MUA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament is indebted to a former member for Wakefield, Bert Kellyâa heroic man who waged a one-man battle against tariffs in Australia throughout his time in parliament. Gough Whitlam eulogised Bert Kelly at his funeral. He said, 'No one man has done more to change Australian economic policy as a backbencher than Bert Kelly.' Bert Kelly talked about lowering tariffs and protections when it was completely unfashionable. His adage was that one man's tariff is another man's job. So it is with the coastal shipping act. The protection of the marine workers is costing jobs in the rest of Australia. Other people are paying the cost of those jobs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a free and open economy in most cases. We certainly have to trade with the world. We sell 75 per cent of the food we grow to the world. We are a major export nation. In as much as we can access overseas shipping for the bulk commodities, we are treated well. But in as much as we're trying to support our manufacturing industry, shifting commodities around Australia for the blast furnace in Whyalla or the blast furnace and metal manufacturing plant in Port Pirie, or trying to get gypsum from Kevin around to Melbourne so we can use gyprock to build Australian houses, we are imposing a major penalty on those employers and on those businesses. This bill doesn't seek to abandon the Australian maritime industryâeven though, probably, if I had my druthers, I wouldâbut perhaps it is being a bit more pragmatic about the world in which we live at the moment. It is an assessment of the capacity of the Australian fleet. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also seeks to lighten the red-tape disincentives for superyachts to come and visit our communities. I'm not too sure how many superyachts you have, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta. I don't have one yet.

At this stage, it's difficult for them to come to Australia, because they'd have to get single-voyage permits, so they go to New Zealand and they go to Fiji. So, New Zealanders and Fijians are benefiting from Australia's coastal shipping act. It seems absurd, really, doesn't it? I don't know how it's protecting jobs here. I don't even think it's protecting our superyacht owners. Perhaps it's protecting their wharf space from Europeans and Americans coming into their little bit of port. I don't know. I mean, it is clearly absurd. Of course I'm making fun of the situation as it sits at the moment, but this bill seeks to get past that, to open up tradeâas we should. We should always be opening up Australia to trade, on every front. We should always be breaking down the barriers that impose costs on our local businesses. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, this bill is not as ambitious as the one that was put forward by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Truss, but it is a reflection of what's happened to the shipping industry, which, despite the efforts of the member of Grayndler, continues to dwindle. More than 50 per cent of the capacity has gone since Mr Truss introduced that billâ63 per cent in 2012. Half the vessels have gone. The age of the vessels is double the world average. The writing is clearly on the wall. We are protecting an inefficient and outdated industry here, and Australia needs to sharpen up, get on with its act and reflect the realities of the day. This bill goes a little wayâa little wayâto addressing some of the issues that Australian industries face. I recommend it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I rise to oppose the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017. Australia is an island continent girt by sea, located in a relatively remote part of the globe. Almost all of our imports and exports are transported in the hulls of ships. Equally significantly, one-tenth of global sea trade flows through our ports. However, despite this obvious reliance on the maritime industry, Australia's own merchant fleet, as well as the skilled workforce it trains and employs, is fast disappearing. Our responsibility is to prevent the demise of this proud industry. The government's approach is to hasten the demise of this proud industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about more than jobs and skills; there are also very sound national security and environmental reasons for having an Australian fleet. Firstly, there are clear synergies between our naval and merchant fleets. Defence experts have long recognised the importance of maintaining a domestic maritime workforce that ensures Australia has a pool of highly skilled labour that can be quickly mobilised during times of war or other national emergencies. A national workforce forum that was established with a former Public Service Commissioner as chair, involving industry, the Navy and the agricultural sector, came up with a consensus proposal to advance workforce development with a very modest contribution from the Commonwealth, which was cut to zero as one of the first acts of the incoming Abbott government. Australian seafarers also undergo stringent background checks to ensure they pose no security threat. We hear a lot from this government about national security, including relating to people on boats, yet this government is prepared to have overseas seafarers whose backgrounds are a mystery on ships around our coast and in some cases in our harbours and our ports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, Australian seafarers are familiar with our coastlines and have a vested interest in the protection of our world renowned environmental assets such as the Great Barrier Reef. All of the significant maritime incidents around our coast over recent decades have something in common: a foreign flag on the back of those ships. Be it the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacific Adventurer</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Shen Neng</span>, an enormous ship that ploughed into the Great Barrier Reef off the coast because the captain literally forgot to turn through the channel, the major maritime accidents that have occurred in our waters and New Zealand's in recent decades have involved foreign flagged vessels crewed by foreign seafarers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are good economic, national security and environmental reasons for having an Australian fleet, which is why the former federal Labor government was so determined to rebuild Australia's shipping industry following years of neglect. Our goal was simple: we wanted to see the Australian flag flying on the back of Australian ships with Australian seafarers carrying more Australian goods around the Australian coastline. We wanted to see an international fleet with the Australian flag on the back of it and with Australian seafarers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After extensive consultations with all sections of the industry we put in place far-reaching reforms that were designed not as a protectionist model but as a model which reduces the costs faced by Australian shippers in order to level the playing field with their international competitors. The 2012 reform package amended legislation from the Navigation Act 1912. The major legislation governing shipping in this nation had been in place for literally 100 years. There were all sorts of arcane provisions in that legislation, such as the fact that a captain could be free from prosecution if they literally murdered a lunatic, defined in the act, around the coastline. That was part of the legislation that was still in place, which was derived not of course from 1912 but really from Westminster in the 19th century. Yet it hadn't been updated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a comprehensive update. The package included a zero tax rate, more-generous accelerated depreciation arrangements, rollover relief for selected capital assets, new tax incentives to employ Australian seafarers, and an exemption from the royalty withholding tax for bareboat leased vessels. To further strengthen the local industry, an international shipping register was created, allowing operators of Australian flagged vessels to employ mixed Australian and foreign crews on internationally agreed rates and conditions. These measures were based on extensive reform programs that had already been implemented by other maritime nations, including the United Kingdom, Japan, China and Denmark. For example, when the UK government introduced a tonnage tax in 2000, its fleet almost doubled in size in just the next seven years. So, while others were employing policies to keep their industry afloat, our industry was sinking into oblivion. Importantly, Labor's changes did not preclude the use of foreign vessels. They simply required that firms needing to move freight between Australian ports first seek out an Australian operator. When none was available, foreign vessels could be used, as long as they paid Australian-level wages on domestic sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our efforts to revitalise this country's shipping industry didn't stop there. We also enacted that first major rewrite of the nation's maritime laws in a century. We've made sure that oil companies pay for any and all damage that their ships may cause. We developed Australia's first national ports strategy, and we replaced a myriad of confusing, often conflicting state and territory based laws and regulations with just one national maritime regulator, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, administering one set of modern, nationwide laws. However, for Labor's suite of reforms to work, they needed time. Because they relied upon investmentâand investment decisions don't occur over a month or even a year; they occur long term, for the life of the vesselâthey needed that certainty. Before the reforms even took effect, the coalition sought to undermine them. Their attacks were calculated to create uncertainty and doubt in the minds of those considering investing in the Australian industry as to the durability of the regulatory changes and the new tax incentives. Still, some companies, like SeaRoad in Tasmania, certainly did invest in new vessels. But, not satisfied with white-anting Labor's reforms in opposition, once elected the coalition moved quickly to scrap them altogether and dismantle what remained of the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us want to reduce the cost of doing business in Australia, but at what cost, if the cost is the destruction of a strategically significant industry and the loss of a highly skilled workforce? In the end, that will put up costs over a period of time if you don't have Australian competitors. The legislation put forward by then minister Warren Truss put ideology ahead of the national interest. Contrary to the coalition's repeated claims that their proposed changes were designed to eliminate red tape and strengthen shipping, what they were about was eliminating Australian jobs. That wasn't a matter of rhetoric or argument from the Australian Labor Party. You just had to look at the regulatory impact statement. The regulatory impact statement attached to that legislation stated explicitly that the savings were as a result of the replacement of Australian seafarers and wages with foreign seafarers being paid foreign wages. Ninety-three per cent of the savings that were identified were as a result of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No other major advanced nation has attempted to engage in such unilateral economic disarmament, which is what it was. For this reason, the Senate rejected the coalition's legislation after the evidence of people like Mr Bill Milby of North Star Cruises, who gave evidence that he had actually had consultations with officials from the department of infrastructure at forums where this policy was launched. Of course, it was launched at the body run by the foreign shippers. That was where the policy was launched. When Mr Milby asked for advice on what to do, he was advised to replace the Australian flag, to register as a foreign flagged vessel and to replace his Australian workforce with foreign workersâquite extraordinary. That was the evidence given by Mr Milby before the Senate committee in this parliamentâan extraordinary proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen since then is, quite frankly, an abuse, including by the department, with regard to the way that the legislation has been implemented. The legislation, as it currently exists, provides for temporary licences. We did that to allow flexibility. What has occurred is abuse. Perhaps the most obscene example of that is the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>takes the raw materials for aluminium from Western Australia over to the smelter in Portland on the coast of Victoria and then goes back again. There is nothing temporary about the <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span>. Yet, in the middle of the night, seafarers were thrown off that vessel. People on that side talk about thuggery. People were thrown off their workplace in the middle of the night to be replaced by foreign workers. I don't understand how the National Party, a party that says it's about the Australian national interest, can support that, but it has supported it over and over again. On this government's watch, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacific Triangle</span>, the CSL <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacific</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lindesay Clark</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tandara Spirit</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">British Loyalty</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hugli Spirit</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alexander Spirit</span>, the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span>, the CSL <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">British Fidelity</span>, the CSL <span style="font-style:italic;">Brisbane</span> and the CSL <span style="font-style:italic;">Thevenard</span> have all gone, replacing the Australian flag with the white flag when it comes to the protection of Australian jobs and the Australian national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will only accelerate the industry's decline, eventually consigning Australia's status as a proud maritime nation to the history pages. That would be an unbelievable development for an island continent like Australia. It's no wonder that, the last time this legislation was before the other chamber, it didn't even get a second reading. People like former Senator Nick Xenophon and others, who always vote for a second reading in the other place because they argue that that's just allowing further debate, saw this legislation as being so reactionary, so against the Australian national interest, that it didn't even get to that stage. Let me tell you: this legislation will not go anywhere either. It is sunk before it has even been through this chamber, and that is a result of the implications which are in it. That's why there's no support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In spite of the fact, as we've run through minister after ministerâand there have been four infrastructure ministers in the recent period that I've shadowed; it's a revolving doorâI've said that I'm prepared and Labor is prepared to have constructive dialogue, but they are not interested. This legislation was introduced not by this minister or the minister before, but, I think, the one before that. Minister Chester, I think, introduced this legislation. It has not received any support. The Australian shipping industry itself opposes this. The workforce opposes this. People who actually understand this industry are all opposed to this legislation because it would undermine the integrity of the entire coastal trading regime. So we will be moving a second reading amendment, and then we will have further amendments in consideration in detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the two sets of amendments in this bill which are particularly problematic. The first amendments relate to the tolerance provisions. The proposed changes to the tolerance provisions would further deregulate what is already one of the world's most liberal coastal trading regimes. The proposed amendments would make it almost impossible for a general licence holderânamely, an Australian-flagged vesselâto contest work, because their owner-operator would never know the actual volume to be loaded or the precise loading date. So they're being asked to basically go for a contract for work without knowing when it'll happen and what the task is. No wonder the domestic industry opposes it. In its submission to the discussion paper, the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ultimate voyage carried out may bear no resemblance to the original voyage for which the Temporary Licence was granted. AIMPE opposes this proposal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the peak industry body, Maritime Industry Australia Ltd:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without the tolerances being meaningful (and remembering that these were expanded by the 2012 reforms from 10% and 3 days to 20% and 5 days) the system may as well be deregulated entirely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Maritime Union of Australia says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such open-ended tolerance provisions would totally undermine accepted commercial arrangements and make it impossible for a GL holder to contest a cargo, as the GL holder would not know what they are contesting. The ability to position a ship when the loading date could vary by up to 30 days would be commercially untenable for a GL holder, as would be the unknown nature of the cargo volume.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Operators of vessels involved in the coastal trade have also expressed their concern about changes to the tolerance limits, including CSL, which currently owns three Australian-flagged vessels operating around the coastline. According to another, ANL:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no justification for putting this forward. There is a flexible regime now, but it works. By way of comparisonâand I note the member for Dawson is here; he's a bit of a fan of President Trumpâin the United States, there is no possibility of any ship other than one with an American flag on the back of it taking goods from San Francisco to Los Angelesânone! They have a completely closed system, and that's a bipartisan position supported by both the Democrats and the Republicans in the United States, because they understand that it arose out of the need to defend their nation. As a result of that and the emphasis they have on defence, they understood the importance of having a national maritime industry. Yet, here in Australia, which has one of the most liberal regimes in the world, this mob want to make it impossible to have an Australian-flagged vessel with Australian workers on it. Just think of the implications for national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second proposal in this legislation is to so-called streamline the temporary licence variation process. I've already spoken about the abuse of the temporary licence process when it comes to vessels like those that replace the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span>. Currently there are two types of licence variations to an existing temporary licence. Firstly, there are authorised matters, namely a change to a loading date or volume on an existing planned voyage. Secondly, there are new matters, which authorise an entirely new voyage on an existing temporary licence. In the name of streamlining the bill proposes replacing the two types of licence variations with a single provision. However, reclassifying the addition of a new voyage to an existing temporary licence from a new matter to an authorised matter would halve the time available to a general licence holderâAustralian shipsâto apply for that new voyage from the current two days to just 24 hours, cutting it in half. In practice that would make it more difficult for the Australian industry to compete. Those opposite say they stand for Australian industry. According to Maritime Industry Australia Ltdâthis is the peak Australian industry, not the Maritime Union of Australia; this is the industry, the employers and the bossesâany new voyage should be subject to the existing time frames for GL holders to respond or else the integrity of the system is undermined as GL holders' rights and opportunities are reduced. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech the former ministerâDarren Chester, the one three ministers back, who introduced this legislationâassured the parliament that the bill makes amendments to the existing regulatory regime, rather than fundamentally restructuring it. However, in light of the two amendments I have just highlighted, this statement is not the case. This is what Maritime Industry Australia Ltd said on 13 September last year. They warned this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there is nothing in the Bill to assist Australian shipowners compete with foreign ships that have all but unfettered access to coastal trades. We held low expectations on that front and unfortunately haven't been disappointed there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be sure, the regulation impact statement is explicit about the bill's goal of increasing the presence of foreign vessels around the Australian coastline. This what is it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the current framework makes it unattractive for foreign ships to enter the coastal trading sector â¦ These amendments â¦ will remove the barriers that currently face many foreign flagged vessels under the current system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There you have it. They are saying explicitly what this legislation is about: favouring foreign-flag vessels rather than Australian vessels, all because of their ideology. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The destructive potential of this bill isn't limited to what remains of the Australian-flag merchant fleet. Just this week, Coral Expeditions, which is based in Cairns, has written about their opposition to this legislation. This is a cruise company whose vessels are crewed by Australians. They employ 150 seafarers in regional Queensland, North Queensland and Far North Queensland. They've been going for 34 years, and they're planning to invest some $100 million to acquire two new additional builds that will employ another 70 Australian seafarers. These cruises go to the Kimberley, Arnhem Land and Cape York regions. However, if the bill now before the House were to become law, it would not only jeopardise Coral Expeditions' expansion plans and the jobs they would create but it would threaten the very survival of the industry. This is what the company says: 'It will have the unintended consequence of killing off the growing and globally respected Australian-flag expedition cruise ship industry.' So says the group general manager, Mark Fifield, and the commercial director, Jeff Gillies. The letter concludes with this simple request to the parliament: 'We urge that the current restrictions on coastal trading for foreign flagged passenger ships be maintained in order to facilitate the steady and sustainable development of coastal tourism and the Australian seafaring industry.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke before about Mr Bill Milby of True North. He was opposed to the previous legislation. On the current legislation, he says this: 'The purpose of temporary licences was to allow foreign ships to carry cargo and passengers in the event that cargo and passengers were already waiting in a port to be shipped from one destination to another. This amendment allows foreign ships to apply for and be granted a temporary licence when there is no cargo or passengers thus allowing the foreign ship to wait at any port and choose to bid against any general licence holder at any time.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, I want to touch briefly on the issue of superyachts. Over the past 12 months, there's been a concerted lobbying campaign to make it easier for foreign flagged superyachts to charter in Australian waters. They have sought changes to the coastal trading act which in turn would afford them protections from Customs obligations. In this bill, the government is attempting to do this, but the problem is that what it is doing through this legislation is potentially harming existing, more traditional sections of the domestic maritime industry. Indeed, it could open the way for foreign transhipment and bunker barge operators to apply for temporary licences to work around the Australian coast. Currently the companies performing these activities, which usually begin and end in the same port, are Australian based and employ Australian seafarers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, Labor is open to reforms that are specifically about that industry and will promote the growth of the industry to the benefit of communities up and down the Australian coastline. But what we're not about is supporting reforms that have unintended consequences such as those that I have just described. We think a better, more sensible long-term solution would be new standalone legislation covering all tourism operators, both local and foreign. Alternatively, the government should give consideration to amending the Customs Act.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this legislation as it stands is flawed. We will fight this legislation in the House. We'll fight it in the Senate. We'll continue to argue the case, because this is about a government that's not prepared to stand up for Australian industry and Australian jobs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  With great pleasure I rise to speak on the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017. I want to talk about the aspect of this bill relating to superyachts and the provisions around superyachts, because one of the greatest benefits of the bill will be the jobs that are created out of an expanding superyacht industry. I'm particularly thinking of jobs that will be created in my electorate, around the Great Barrier Reef, one of the prime spots that superyachts want to come and visit, particularly the Whitsunday Islands. The Whitsundays are somewhat of a sailing Mecca. This weekend Hamilton Island Race Week starts, followed the week after by the Shag Islet Cruising Yacht Club race week, where every sailor is also a vice-commodore. The Whitsundays are just so beautiful. People who have been there, who have been out on the water and seen those islands, know that this is a world-class destination comparable to any around the world when it comes to sailing, whether it be Monaco, the Greek islands or the Caribbean. Being biased, I've got to say that it's better.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Whitsundays, just near Airlie Beach we have the Abell Point Marina, a very large marina that's been developed in recent years by the company there, headed by Paul Darrouzet. They have been instrumental in pushing for the establishment of a superyacht hub in the Whitsundays. Kate Purdie, the general manager at Abell Point Marina, emailed me today saying that it's expected that large numbers of superyachts will venture into the South Pacific in the next few years leading up to the America's Cup in New Zealand. For the Whitsundays to benefit from this influx of superyachts, it is imperative that we have charter rules similar to those of other South Pacific countries, such as New Zealand. Should charter be permitted in Australia, it is expected that vessels will stay significantly longer in the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem, as was alluded to in that email from Kate from Abell Point, is that there are currently impediments amongst our regulatory settings that prevent superyachts from gaining a temporary licence for a round-trip voyage. The regulations currently force superyacht operators to pay customs importation duties and taxes, so they simply don't come. Why would they? When you're paying the equivalent of 10 per cent on a vessel that's $50 million or $100 million, you simply go elsewhere. So, we don't get them. We have some domestic superyachts, but in terms of the big international drawcard, we simply don't get them. They go elsewhere. They go to New Zealand, they go to Monaco, they go to Noumea, they go to Vanuatu and they go to Fiji. They go anywhere else that doesn't have these impositions. What ends up happening is that we just lose the revenue. There are significant economic benefitsârevenue in particular, as I said. The ability for these vessels to charter would unlock about $1.64 billion for our national economy, creating almost 12,000 jobs. That's money that I want to see pumped into the Whitsundays economy, pumped into the Mackay economy and pumped into the Townsville economy. That will be pumped into the Gold Coast and it will be pumped up into Cairns, and jobs will be created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bizarrely, there is an argument that's been put here, and I've heard itâand I've got to say, it's quite unfortunate that I heard some derogatory remarks by the Labor Party around this provision, as if this is some benefit for the richies. They simply don't come. They don't come to Australia, because of this tax. So, no money is actually being paid in tax at the moment. They don't come. We have domestic vessels here, but the significant number of superyachts that sail around the world go to places where there's no financial imposition on them like what we have in Australia, so they don't come, and we don't get that income. We could be getting income, because if they came and then they chartered the superyachts we'd be collecting the GST on all the tickets that went out. But they don't even come, so we don't get anything at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Blue-collar workers would receive a very big benefit from superyachts being here in their droves. Tradies and small businesses would be the big winners from superyachts spending time in Australia. Each vessel spends millions of dollarsâabout 10 to 12 per cent of their vessel value annuallyâin maintenance, which goes directly into small family-owned businesses up and down the coast, in these marinas, and employs workers. It's critical for all of these ports, particularly in places like the Whitsundays. Industry peak bodies are saying that superyachts domesticallyâand perhaps there are a few that come in from time to time, but not manyâadd about $590 million to our economy, but it could generate $3.34 billion by 2020-21, if the regulatory settings were right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, Queensland Treasury commissioned an economic impact study of the superyacht sector. It was done by the Queensland Labor government. The strategy forecast Queensland's share of the global superyacht sector to increase by about 10 per cent, making Queensland a key destination for superyachts throughout the Asia-Pacific. The majority of the benefits would be in the Whitsundays, Cairns, and Port Douglas. Again, this is a critical reason why I'm here speaking on this and pleading with the other side to let it pass so that we can create these local jobs. It is money spent in the local community. But it's more than just the vessels getting fixed or serviced. There's the retail spend of the people who go on these vessels. They are very, very rich indeed and they drop a fair bit of coin when they're in a port. There are the food servicesâfood that has to be loaded onto the vessels for the people on them. There is the accommodation, if they stop for a little while. Then there are the running costs, the repairs and maintenance and other provisions and supplies. Having a single superyacht in the marina at Abell Point, or any marina for that matter, would push about $50,000 to $60,000 a week into the local economyâa job a week. I'm told that in Noumea they have about 200 sitting there for a week every year. Think of the income we're losing. That is a lot of money flowing through a regional economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to give a lot of credit to Paul Darrouzet for being at the point we are at today with this legislation, Paul being the owner of Abell Point Marina. Back in 2016 we started this journey of looking at these provisions. He got in contact with me and said that, unfortunately, due to 20-year-old restrictions we achieve visitation from less than one per cent of the world's superyachts. Consequently, the vast economic benefits inherent in these visits are reaped by all of our Pacific neighbours, and specifically New Zealand, with its now world-class superyacht refit, repair and new-build industries. He said at the time that six superyachts that he knew of had stated in writing their intention to avoid the region in the next year, unless those regulations were removed, either by legislation, regulation, ministerial instrument or whatever is necessary. He has begged this place to remove the bureaucratic roadblocks and allow Australia's emerging superyacht industry to achieve its potential. We are here today to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will exempt superyachts from paying customs import duties and taxes. It will remove the five-voyage minimum requirement, which better reflects the superyacht operating model. Superyachts are often chartered for a single voyage at a time. The operators follow the best weather and cruise the Pacific's beautiful locations, like the Whitsundays. The legislation will also broaden the definition of a voyage to include round tripsâsuperyachts can't get temporary licences, because they're usually round trips that start and leave at the same port. The legislation will also allow vessels to dry dock under a temporary licence, which means repairs and refits of superyachts can be done in these places, once again pumping money into local economies and creating a hell of a lot of local jobs. I am told that what this legislation will not do is remove protections for Australian-flagged superyachts. An Australian-flagged superyacht operator with a general licence would still have the same right to contest an application under the coastal trading act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an industry that is ripe for the picking. We've just got to get the settings right. Let me just explain the flow-on benefits that this could potentially have. There's a little community called Bowen in my electorate. Bowen has been a Labor town for a long, long timeâuntil recently, I have to say. It is a coalmining town and a port town. These are salt of the earth workers. It's a little town that's suffered a death of a thousand cuts economically. Slowly things have been whittled away from it. We've pumped in government services there but industries have closed down, meatworks and saltworks have scaled back, and there have been knocks to the ag sector there. Adani, which everyone opposes, and the expansion of Abbot Point could have lifted that town up by now but, no, that's not to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Darrouzet has a vision to have a huge marina down there at Bowen, which would have servicing centres for superyachts within it. This could create a whole new industry in that small town, which, as I said, over a long period of timeâdecadesâhas been dying a death of a thousand cuts economically. It could revitalise the place. It could create so many new local jobs just if we did this one thingâif we passed this billâbecause there are people who are already looking to jump on board that potential investment and get it going. I'm very hopeful that we'll be able to deliver that for Bowen, but it is going to take this bill getting passed through this place to get that done, otherwise all these opportunities are dashed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say that a lot of work that I have done, along with other people in the superyacht industry down here, over the last couple of years will probably have been in vain if this is not passed. We've done a lot in terms of changing the settings within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, working with the former environment ministerânow health ministerâand working with the current environment minister to get settings changed where these superyachts were restricted throughout specific areas of the Great Barrier Reef. They are completely unnecessary restrictions, because these are first-class environmental vessels. While they're big, big ships, they actually carry a very small environmental footprint. They go to very sensitive areas and they do it in a very well-managed process and a well-managed operation where they're not upsetting the local environment. We've done all that. We've achieved all that. We got the settings changed when there were people at the start saying, 'You probably can't do that. People will get upset,' but no-one's been upset. They've all been achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do now is remove these financial barriers that currently send these superyachts to Noumea, Fiji and New Zealandâanywhere elsewhere where there's no financial barrier. All these other places are reaping the rewards in terms of the spend that the people who go on board the superyachts bring to local communities. They're getting the jobs. We're not getting them. We're not getting them in Cairns. We're not getting them on the Gold Coast. We're not getting them in Townsville, Mackay, the Whitsundays or Bowen. The sad thing is that if this doesn't pass this place, we just won't get them. It will go begging. It will take a long while before we get back to this place again where we're able to have a bill before the House that actually allows us to do this. It would be a great, great shame. For a little town like Bowen, a solid Labor voting town over most of its years of existence, another economic opportunity will be denied to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are cheap shots that can be thrown, and they have been thrown in this place, about removing the GST off superyachts like it benefits the rich. It's nonsense. It will benefit these poor people in Bowen who are unemployed, underemployed and desperately seeking work. It will benefit the workers in Airlie Beach. It will benefit all of these communities up and down the Queensland coastline that could potentially have superyachts in there revitalising their communities with that extra spend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge each and every one of the members of this House to think of those communities, think of those job opportunities, think of that money that could be pumped into these economies and vote for this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  I will respond to the member for Dawson's speech on the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017. I could not help but think to myself, here he is advocating for the removal of GST from vessels worth $100 million, a tax that his party introduced to this parliament over the vehement opposition of those of us on this side. If his party hadn't introduced the GST he wouldn't be having that problem. You might want to think about that, Member for Dawson. This is a problem entirely of your own party's making. You brought in the GST; now you have to live with it. And to think that he stood there advocating for the removal of the GST from vessels worth upwards of $100 million, while the people of Bowen, when they go to their local shops, have to pay GST on the goods that they pay forâthose good, hardworking people still have to pay the GSTâwell, it just beggars belief and says everything about those on that side of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is an island country. We are the only country in the world to straddle an entire continent. From east to west, north to south, we are surrounded by water. Of all the countries in the world, you would think that we, above all others, would cherish a domestic maritime fleet. Of all the countries in the world, you would think that it would be Australia that would home to a strong coastal shipping industry and that it would be Australia training the best maritime engineers, the best shipmakers, the best sailors and officers, the best technicians and the best navigators in the world. But that is increasingly not the case. Under the Howard government, Australian shipping was decimated. The Liberals happily turned a blind eye to massive rorting of temporary licences for foreign vessels in Australian waters, leading to the near disappearance of Australian vessels and Australian crews on our coastal routes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor defeated the Howard Liberal government, we introduced the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012, which breathed new life into the sector by changing tax rules and tightening the rules around foreign vessels. The member for Grayndler was infrastructure minister at the time, and his changes to the coastal trading act remain Australia's biggest maritime reform since the passing of the Navigation Act roughly 100 years earlier. But now, again, we have a new attempt by the Liberals to cripple Australian coastal shipping, and, more particularly, to target the men and women who work on Australian ships. I've heard it said by some that the decimation of coastal shipping is an inadvertent by-product of this. I don't believe it is. I think it's the aim of the governmentâto decimate Australian coastal shipping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not beat about the bush: we all know that the Liberals hate Australia's coastal shipping sector because its labour force is unionised and refuses to doff the cap. While workers are unionised, whether on ships or building sites, in schools or hospitals, or on trains, the Liberals will do everything in their power to bust them apart, because they know that workers who are not unionised are easier to control, will accept lower wages and will not stand up for their rights in the workplace. The Liberals care about one thingâgetting the cheapest deal possible. They don't like Australian coastal shipping, because it costs more than the rust buckets crewed by exploited foreign workers that can get goods from A to B for a few dollars less. Little wonder then that the Liberals are so committed to repealing Labor's legislation, which provides fairness for workers and certainty for investors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we're speaking about today seeks to deregulate the Australian domestic shipping industry. It will have the same effect on Australian shipping that Liberal policies have had on Australian car manufacturing. It will destroy investment and destroy jobs. Importantly, it will destroy career pathways for young Australians. This bill removes the preference for Australian flagged and crewed vessels, and replaces the three-tiered licencing regime with a single permit system that grants access to vessels of any nationality to work the Australian coastline for a 12-month period. It significantly extends the period of exemption from domestic wage standards for workers on foreign vessels in Australian waters. It's a disgrace. Every bit of this bill is an affront to Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals are actively seeking to replace Australian ships with foreign ships. The Liberals are actively seeking to replace Australian workers with foreign workers. The Liberals are actively seeking to replace Australian wages in Australian waters with foreign wages in Australian waters. And they're not even being covert about it. If they can do this with ships, they will do it with shops, and they'll do it on building sites. How long before the Liberals actively seek to replace Australian shop workers and Australian construction workers with foreign workers on visas? How long before the Liberals actively seek to replace Australian wages with lower foreign wages on land, not just on water? </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  'Do I give them what they want?' That's the question you always ask yourself when you hear an appalling speech. They want to incite a debate, and when you hit back, the debate is exactly what they hoped for. But there has to be a point when this parliament says enough. If we haven't reached that point tonight then for some of us there is apparently no limit at all. In the other place Senator Anning has just delivered his first speech and, in delivering the sort of bile that we get from time to time against Muslim Australians, decided to invoke the term 'final solution'âanother speech belittling Australians, dividing the nation and inciting debate. To those who thought that the best thing may not be to give them what they want, I say, 'If we continue to hold back, they have exactly what they wanted.' Muslim Australians, African Australians, Chinese Australians and, when you invoke the 'final solution', Jewish Australians are now, in the same way as Greek Australians and Italian Australians were in years gone by, subject to prejudice. The bigotry of today is no different to the bigotry of yesterday, and right now we don't have the bipartisanship against it that we had in years gone byâand it must return. The words spoken in the other place are not the words of a proud Australian; they are the words of people who hate modern Australia and hate who we are as Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overseas voices have been encouraged and welcomed into this country. Lauren Southern turned up in my local area with a camera crew from North America, looked around and said, 'It's all monoculture'âjust like when the so-called 'person in charge of multicultural affairs' claimed that we have all these monocultural areas throughout Australia. The film crew and the journo who was there were good enough to ask, 'Which monoculture? Is it the Arabic culture represented by this shop or the Vietnamese culture represented by that shop? The Pakistani or the Pacific islander? Which monoculture are you talking about?' to which Lauren Southern said, 'There isn't even an English pub.' And they replied, 'Actually there's one immediately behind you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our diversity is nothing to be afraid of, but the silence from those opposite is everything to fear, because when modern Australia is under attack in this way, the fight is going to be won only when we get to the point of bipartisanship again, and be in no doubt: we are not there right now. For anyone who was wondering whether we were, a lot changed at the last election, at which members of One Nation were returned to the parliament. At that time, instead of adopting the sort of language that John Howard had adopted, the government members started to refer to One Nation today as being more sophisticated than they used to be. Bigotry is not sophisticated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Longman by-election the government allocated preferences to One Nation, rather than follow John Howard's lead in putting One Nation last. The 18C legislation, not referred to during the election campaign, was suddenly brought on in parliament to give extra licence for racist hate speech. The immigration minister stood right there and referred to Australians not as second- and third-generation Australians but as second- and third-generation Lebanese Muslims, and then described them as a mistake. The government introduced university-level English tests which you didn't have to take if you were emigrating from the five English-speaking nations that are predominantly white: Canada, the United States, Ireland, the UK or New Zealand. They didn't have to do the test; only people from non-white countries had to do it, even if they had grown up with English. In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Weatherboard and Iron</span> the member for New England constantly referred to the poor, white, regional fringe. Why is the white reference there all the time? I say to those opposite that it's not good enough to turn up to community fundraisers and events, say all the right things there and think people won't notice what's been happening in the parliament. Don't apologise for racism, don't imitate it and don't preference it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I'm very pleased to talk about my South West and the projects that I've been working to deliver. As you know only too well, Mr Speaker, the Turnbull government is creating a stronger economy, ensuring that we can guarantee the essential services Australians rely on, provide income tax relief and bring the budget back into balance. We can see this working when we look at the one million jobs that have been created by business since the Turnbull government was elected nearly five years ago. The record is growing, with over 50,000 jobs created in June. It adds to the total of 339,000 jobs that have been created in the past 12 months. This is business doing what business does best. Over 95,000 of those jobs went to young Australiansâthe strongest growth in jobs for young Australians in about 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stronger economy also gives the government the capacity to support some really good local projects. Recently I announced several new projects in the South West which will create new local jobs, and economic and social growth. I secured $1.5 million towards a new depot and first aid training centre for St John Ambulance in Busselton. This is so important to the volunteers who provide countless hours of service to the local community. They are a critical part of our emergency services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also secured funding for the Busselton-Margaret River Airport and the Busselton Foreshore Redevelopment. The Busselton-Margaret River Airport upgrade is another forward step towards securing its redevelopment with over $1.4 million in federal funding for the airfreight hub. The project will enable airfreight services to actually start from the airport, opening opportunities for the region's food and ag and broader sectors. It also provides some greater confidence to the region, which has been in limbo following the state Labor government's decision to fund the final stages of the airport upgrade. This decision has impacted the region's economy and put jobs, businesses and investment at risk. The announcement for funding for the airport by the federal government is in addition to the original $9 million for the airport upgradeâthe actual airstrip itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in Busselton there's a new marine discovery centre to be established at the end of the iconic Busselton Jetty. This will include a multipurpose area and swimming area. The Busselton Jetty is the second most visited tourist attraction in Western Australia, and the new centre will provide the next experience for the tourists who come to our part of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The town of Harvey will also receive a new multipurpose facility, with over $600,000 of federal funding going towards upgrading the community and sports centre. That will include a social room, kitchen, and change rooms. The local people have worked hard for this for several years. The Augusta Cultural and Heritage Winter Festival will be able to conduct historical site tours and cultural talks in collaboration with local Indigenous leaders as a result of federal support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects might seem simple to some people but these are the sorts of job-creating, local economic and social projects that really make a difference, particularly in rural and regional areas like my area of the South West of Western Australia. Members on this side understand how to foster economic growth, nurture growth and create jobs. The government's sound economic management is exactly what is ensuring, as I said, essential services, and it will allow over 62,000 constituents in my electorate of Forrest to receive the tax relief they experienced from 1 July. It is the sound economic management of the government that allows us to continue to keep Australians safe, something that none of us take for granted or should. It is perhaps the primary responsibility for any government. Other local projects, like the Withers Fibre Link ConnectionâCCTV cameras in Bunbury and Nannupâare all local projects which are really necessary. At a local level they help to keep people safe in the South West. We do it at a national level and we do it locally as well. Keeping Australians safe is something that we are continuing to commit to. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="C2T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Thirty years ago the ABC cost us eight cents a day. Now it costs just half that, at about four cents a day. With that four cents it delivers news we can trust 24 hours a day, every day, across the regions and across TV, radio and online. Frankly, you'd really think that's pretty good value for money in this day and age. But no: instead, the coalition's telling the ABC to find another $84 million in savings on top of the $254 million that it has already cut from the national broadcaster since 2014. Why? Well, it sure ain't budget repairârather, it's petty revenge for the baseless view that fair and fearless reporting is somehow biased reporting. Regrettably, it's the Australian public who will pay the price for this vengeful ideological crusade. The reality is that the ABC is competent and efficient and gives value for money. The cuts to its funding are unacceptable and must be reversed. Indeed, stripping funding fundamentally diminishes Australia's independent media generally and, in particular, the ABC's vital role as the nation's emergency broadcaster, especially in rural, regional and remote Australia and especially in Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In any case, let's stop thinking about what the ABC costs the community, and instead think of the cost to the community if the ABC falters. In this era of fake news and diminishing investment in journalism the ABC is a priceless source of trusted news. Indeed, 71 per cent of Australian adults watch, read or listen to the ABC every week. Moreover, 82 per cent of Australians trust the information provided by the ABC, making it the nation's most trusted media organisation. It really is the place Australians turn to, the voice they trust. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Never is what I say truer than in times of emergency and disasters like bushfires, floods and cyclones, when the ABC is often the only source for the latest advice, warnings, news and information. Moreover, as mobile phone batteries run flat and power is lost, it's only the ABC, on a battery-powered or car radio, that links people to life-saving advice. For example, during the Dunalley bushfires in Tasmania five years ago, a lack of mobile services in the region hindered Tasmania Fire Service's ability to inform the public. Entire communities were cut off for days without power, but people could still access advice and warnings about the ever-changing fire front on the ABC. There's no doubt this service saved lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how does the federal government reward the ABC for performing such a vital role, which no other media organisation could replace? With funding cut after funding cut, it's politics at its worst. No wonder the public is fed up with politicians. I emphasise again that the ABC presence in the regions is vital and priceless, especially as commercial media, looking to cut costs, are increasingly abandoning the regions and retreating to the major metropolitan centres. For instance, in Tasmania, just this month WIN axed its locally produced news bulletins, leaving a few journalists on the ground from Monday to Friday to gather content to send to Wollongong. There, almost 1,000 kilometres away, producers and presenters who may never have set foot in Tasmania will deliver the news, trashing the fundamental principle that local knowledge is a vital ingredient of journalism. On weekends there won't be any local content. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, in the north of the state there's a big question mark hanging over the future of the two newspapers published by Fairfax, which are subject to a takeover bid by the Nine Network, which has no appetite for a couple of regional newspapers in Tasmania. No wonder there's a palpable fear in newsrooms across the state that WIN's exit will be just the first domino to fall in the beginning of the end for local news in Tasmania. Imagine if the ABC, reeling from budget cuts, starts eyeing off its regional offices. Who would be left to tell the stories of the drought? Who would be left to cover the bushfires and natural disasters that don't happen Monday to Friday or in convenient proximity to the metropolitan newsrooms in Sydney and Melbourne? Once the ABC has gone, we'll all look back with regret at what was lost. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  About a fortnight ago I was very honoured to make a trip to Japan, where I and the members for Dawson and Mackellar and two colleagues from the Labor side of parliament made visits to several power stations and to a steel plant and also had meetings with Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; with J-POWER, which is one of Japan's largest electricity generators; and with Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation. The unequivocal message we had from those three organisations, three organisations that have been majorly responsible for the economic success of Japan over many years, was that renewables are not cost competitive. That is the message coming out of Japan. They have done their sums and have worked out that the cheapest way to generate electricity to supply their people is to pay a premium and import coal all the way from Australia to use in their latest technology coal generation plants. That was the clear message they gave us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the month prior to when we went there, the Japanese government reduced its carbon emissions targets. In their electricity sector they were trying to achieve by 2030 a 26 per cent reduction from 2013 levels, which is very similar to what we have here in Australia. However, they weren't doing that by locking those targets in legislation and mandating them with penalties. In fact, I thought it was interesting that their target for intermittent generation of wind and solar combined was a mere 9.4 per cent of Japan's total electricity generation by the year 2030. In contrast, under the NEG modelling, we are looking at something like a 29 per cent to 30 per cent target for intermittent generation facilitiesâand the more intermittent generation capacity you put into the grid, the higher the costs you have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also able to visit Japan's Isogo clean-coal plant in Yokohama. In fact, it is located only six kilometres from downtown Yokohama. It uses ultra-supercritical technology, not only to reduce carbon dioxide emissions but also to reduce sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and particulate matter. Japan is also at the moment planning to roll out something like another 30 new coal-fired power stations across the nation. They have a similar issue to us: their existing coal fleet is ageing. They have done the sums and are going to replace their existing coal fleet with latest technology coal-fired power stations. That is what Japan is doing to ensure their nation stays economically competitive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week some very interesting data came out on the People's Republic of China's China Energy Portal. It showed the year-on-year growth in power generation from the second quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018. All up, it showed growth of 244 terawatt hours, and the main growth came from thermal generation. An extra 176 terawatt hours of electricity was generated using thermal generationâthat's coal and gasâin China in the second quarter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put that number into some type of context, Australia's total annual thermal generation as of 2018 is around 150 terawatt hours of electricity. So what China has added in the last 12 months alone in electricity generation from thermal resources is actually more than Australia's entire production of electricity from thermal resources over an entire year.

                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Before I get to my remarks, I just want to endorse the remarks made by the member for Watson earlier in the adjournment debate this evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This evening, I wish to bring to our nation's attention some of the innovative and really very important community programs operating in the City of Armadale in the electorate of Burt. These are programs that are producing positive, life-changing results that, if expanded to create a critical mass of change, would produce community-wide benefits so that they don't change just the story of the participants and their families but that of the whole community. By pursuing such a critical-mass approach, these programs would not just be valuable proofs of concept and demonstrations of individual programs, which they are, but show the real community-wide benefit that can flow and the savings to government that can be achieved by truly joined-up interventions and community supports. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of these programs is the Child and Parent Centre at Challis Community Primary School. Before this program kicked off, children were starting school lacking the most basic language and social skills, and these developmental vulnerabilities were significantly higher than the national average. The Challis model brings together high-quality early childhood education prior to preschool meshed with parenthood early intervention programs to complement early learning and address barriers to child development, as well as family supports for a consistent scaffolding to optimise children's progress. This system starts from birth and is delivered through a single point of contact at the school, ensuring that children start school ready to learn and are supported through their early schooling. The results have been truly amazing, with students who have been part of the program outperforming their peers by up to 95 per cent. But we need critical mass, not just one school in the community. We need a critical mass of schools delivering such an approach, lifting the average performance and overall outcomes for the entire community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the Armadale Youth Intervention Partnership, demonstrating how a targeted, collaborative and place based approach with purposely resourced backbone leadership can support better outcomes for young people with complex needs. It's an early intervention model aimed at preventing children from committing crimes and then becoming the responsibility of the justice system, to instead re-engage with school and set on a pathway to employment and becoming productive members of our community. This work involves a trauma-informed response bringing together educators, youth workers, neuropsychologists and others in an intensive intervention that is consent based. This program works with children aged eight to 12 in our community who have high rates of truancy, are known to the Department for Child Protection and are known to police as being at risk of criminal behaviour. While the 63 family members of these seven child participants are involved, it is also the case that these children represent only half of those meeting the at-risk criteria within the City of Armadale, let alone across the entire electorate of Burt. This program has produced very positive results in a short time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, for every day that a young person is kept out of juvenile detention, we actually save $815. Given that approximately one in four juvenile detainees come from my electorate, the government investment in this program pays huge dividendsâspending less on police, courts and corrective services whilst gaining a lot more from the people we have helped. We need to provide more opportunities for at-risk kids not just in the electorate of Burt but across the country before they end up in the juvenile justice system. At the very least, let's try to meet the demand of those across the City of Armadale. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the WA Labor government's proposed three-year pilot, at Armadale Senior High School, of a full-service program which will kick off next year. Schools in lower socioeconomic areas like Armadale are increasingly required to cope with non-academic issues such as health and safety. These often spill into the classroom and hamper students' ability to learn. This program will go beyond the traditional classroom and will help schools support modern families, and the complex issues they face, with a youth and community service hub of health initiatives, life skills, and enhanced education options for students and their families. Again, the opportunity exists for a full community benefit by bringing such an approach to all of our local senior high schools, not just one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact these current and future programs will have on the lives of our children will be hugely significant. They are quite literally changing the story of their lives, but the opportunity is so much more. The positive impact these programs make is muted because they are not widespread enough in the community. They create localised change, but we need that change to have a holistic impact and not be held back by the broader community they exist in. Changing the story of the lives of children and their families also has to be about changing the stories of others in our community and changing the stories that their community has about itself and what it can achieve. We know these and other pilot programs work. We now need to support them to grow and flourish, just as the children within them have already done. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about the drought in my electorate of Farrer and, indeed, in the whole of New South Wales and much of Queensland and to suggest a strategy that my irrigators in the New South Wales Murray region could assist with. I want to make a very important point. While the dryland drought creeps further north, west and south, irrigator allocations in the New South Wales Murray region are at zero. That's not because we've had low inflows into the storages in the upper Snowy Mountains and the Hume and Murrumbidgee catchments. It's actually because the drought in Western Queensland and New South Wales has meant very low flows into and out of Menindee, so the Murray River is doing the heavy lifting, if you like, and transmitting to South Australia the water entitlements that we're obliged to under various environmental watering plans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of this is that irrigators in the New South Wales Murray region are on zero allocation, and this is unheard of, because normally autumn rain means you plant your winter cereal crop, and, by the time it needs wateringâperhaps in Septemberâyou have a general security allocation. But now we're facing the opening of the season tomorrow, and the crops are on the verge of dying. Farmers have spent an enormous amount on the inputs into putting these crops into the ground, and they're now facing their imminent demise. But there is a solution, and that's the really important point that I want to raise tonight. The solution is that there is significant environmental water in the Hume Damâindeed, in the storages. In the southern connected basin, there is over 500 gigalitres of water that has been allocated to the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before anyone suggests that we want to take that water from the environment, of course we don't. We recognise the role and responsibility of the environmental water holdersâCommonwealth, state and around the countryâbut we also know that that water can't be used instantly. In fact, there are plans for it that go into next year. So what we are suggesting is a borrow of existing environmental water storages in the Hume Dam and perhaps in Burrinjuck for the Murrumbidgee, that would be allocated early to finish these winter crops or to enhance the production of winter crops and then be paid back. There's a risk, of course, when you do anything like thisâand we saw that in the Snowy borrow that was effected last yearâbut the principle was sound. Irrigators, irrigation corporations and perhaps even the New South Wales government would be prepared to underwrite that risk. We're not talking about months. We're talking about weeks during which we will see the crops die, and then the farmers that I represent in this region are looking at no income for 18 months. It is just plain ridiculous that, while these crops are dying, farmers are seeing the water going straight past their farms on its way down to wherever it is allocated a long way from them or sitting in the storages, which are relatively full, waiting for the environmental allocation that's required of it later on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The upside of farmers in the New South Wales Murray region being able to grow crops is, of course, that they would provide fodder for the dryland farmers elsewhere in the state and perhaps also in Queensland, where the minister for agriculture has had drought in his own electorate for eight years. So it really makes perfect sense, and it's a win-win. We're talking fodder crops. You could bulk out the cereals for fodder. You could cut hay. I know my colleagues in Victoria, the members for Murray and Mallee, are also on this case because they face a similar, if not quite as bad, set of circumstances. What we're saying is: we can help with the drought. I had one farmer today contact me to say: 'I'll do it for nothing. I just want to help my fellow farmers.' So it's really important that everybody who has a dog in this fight brings it to the table and gets the responsible, official bureaucracy to do whatever it takes. It's really important that we solve this problem for our farmers. I've spoken at length to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. I've spoken to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. I thank the minister for agriculture for his interest and investment in finding a solution. I thank the Prime Minister for working hard on behalf of our farmersâsomething that he has always been very well and truly committed to. But I know that we can do more, and I am looking for an environmental borrow from the storages in the upper catchment to look after the farmers in my electorate of Farrer.</span>

They deserve recognition. The census data from 2016 reveals that the number of people who care for someone with a disability is 20 per cent higher in Blair than the Queensland state average. Carers need support, and that support is provided by the many organisations around Blair that provide disability services. One such organisation is the Endeavour Foundation, who recently opened a new flagship learning and lifestyle centre in East Street in the Ipswich CBD. The Endeavour Foundation team in Ipswich offers services to people with a disability who have left school and are transitioning to various forms of independence. The centre provides lessons in lifestyle skills. There is an in-house kitchen for teaching cooking and domestic skills. They also teach hygiene, budgeting, home maintenance and organisation skills. Participants are taught about safety and awareness in public, banking and using public transport. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centre offers people with a disability the opportunity to socialise in friendly surrounds, to make connections and to undertake activities they enjoy. Participants are encouraged to take care of their mental and physical wellbeing as well as that of their family and friends. The learning and lifestyle centre's focus is on choice, providing people living with a disability the opportunity to find the skills, hobbies and employment opportunities they enjoy. One of the most important features is the virtual reality technology that provides participants with an innovative and unique experience with everyday activities. Clients are taken through tasks, ranging from using public transport to operating a forklift in a simulator controlled VR environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Endeavour Foundation have had a long history of working in Ipswich since they opened Claremont. They purchased that historic home near the banks of the Bremer River in 1957. The Endeavour Foundation now provide support for more than 85 people across Ipswich, including learning and lifestyle services, one-on-one support, community access, in-home support, and respite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November this year I'll be hosting the Blair Disability Links expo in Ipswich and launching the 2019 Blair Disability Links directory. Together with the Blair Seniors Links directory, we have given out more than 100,000 of these directories to people across Ipswich and the surrounding region. This year, following the success of the Blair Disability Links and the Blair Seniors Links directories, we'll be launching the inaugural Blair Sports Links. Ipswich is a sporting community that has produced many champions in their respective sports, including Allan Langer and Leah Neale, who was recently at the Olympics. The directory will connect sporting people from juniors to seniors and everyone in between to a range of sporting clubs. I ask everyone, whether they are working in disability, senior or sporting organisations, to contact my office if they want to be involved in the directories.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Few policy areas are more important to Australians than health and hospital policies. Obviously Australia has a first-class health system, funded by two levels of government. Often those complex hospital agreements that are struck every two or three years can have a big impact on local hospitals, particularly like mine in Redland in the outer metro area of Brisbane in South-East Queensland. I'm rarely afforded the opportunity to visit Redland Hospital. I did have that chance two weeks ago. I sincerely want to thank the staff who made it possible for me to meet with the volunteers at the front door as you walk in, the hardworking A&amp;E staff and those who work in the birthing suites and in the medical and renal dialysis areas of the hospital. It is obvious that this is a massive operation. Australia has first-class tertiary hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Redland operates slightly in the shadow of Logan Hospital. It has elements of coverage from that slightly larger hospital and has staff rotations out of Princess Alexandra Hospital. It's good to see the member for Petrie, who comes from the other side of the river. Obviously they are the beneficiary of some slightly higher funding growth that occurred in metro north, and I'll be exploring that issue a little later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My job, of courseâand the member for Petrie won't be happyâis to look after metro south and to make sure that the funding that we see coming to those hospitals is just as generous, because our population growth is certainly the equal of yours. If one were to drive through North Lakesâand wish that one could get back to Redlands as soon as one canâit would be obvious that the population growth there is no less than the growth we are seeing in Springfield and other parts of Brisbane's south.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when I'm looking at the funding, I'm looking at the state's ability to shift federal money between state funding areas based on where they plan services to be delivered, as opposed to how the federal government does it, which is primarily on activityâand I know that there are some members on the other side who probably don't always enjoy the fact that activity is an element rapidly disappearing from health funding; increasingly, we are looking now at outcomes based funding. But, for the moment, that is how funding is distributed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of great concern that, as to metro south, it is still very difficult to tease apart exactly what is happening in each hospital. If you're a slightly smaller hospital, you're concerned about the 24-hour surgical cover. You're concerned about whether you're large enough to have an ICU that looks after serious operations and the critical care that's often offered in the larger ones. You're concerned about whether you'll actually ever get an MRI licence at all, let alone a Medicare-funded one. And you're concerned about whether there will be adequate parking so that nursing staff can walk home between shifts and get to their vehicle without feeling fear because they're moving in very dark, poorly illuminated and crowded car parks, let alone those who arrive in the middle of the night to start a shift. These are massive concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm glad that there will beâI hope there will beâa Labor Bowman candidate with some expertise, for the first time, in any area whatsoever, and, this time, I hope it will be in health and hospitals. And, if it is, we will be putting very clear questions to them about the growth rates for funding to our Redland Hospital, about the likelihood of carpark updates, and about an ICU and about MRIâthese very important issues for my electorate. I put the Labor candidate on notice in Redlands.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this government used its winter break to continue its attack on hardworking Australians, our community was trying to fix the mess the government has caused through its faulty and haphazard NBN rollout. Over the past few weeks, my office has been inundatedâfloodedâwith phone calls, emails and letters about the absolute disaster that is the MTM, the Malcolm Turnbull mess, rollout in Riddells Creek. While the majority of the town finally received their mixed roll-out, this government showed just how completely incapable it is of doing its job right, leaving out many homes across Riddells Creek. I've spoken to residents who are living just 400 metres from the NBN node, and those houses have been ignored and have no service or telephony services at all. There are small-business owners who can no longer make phone calls. There are families whose kids can't do their homework because there's no connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can the government blatantly gloat about the NBN when people in our communities are being taken off the grid, full stop? And what response do they get from the NBN? 'There's nothing we can do.' Well, that's just not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While some of the residents in Riddells Creek have been 'upgraded', their internet speeds are now half of what they were beforehand! So you don't have to look far to find frustrated Facebook posts from fed-up residents who are just sick and tired of this debacle. Just getting connected to the NBN isn't enough, because the Riddells Creek so-called upgrade is on second-rate old copper, leaving them with slower speeds and regular dropouts. One constituent told me that his signal level was sitting at 67 dBm, when the minimum requirement for reliable connection is 99. Maybe the government needs to get a dictionary to find out the definition of 'upgrade'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout our communities in McEwen, in places like Sunbury, Kilmore, Romsey, Lancefield, Riddells Creek and Gisborne, residents are frustrated that they've been snubbed as to a stable connection and are being forced to fibre to the node and fixed wireless. But never fear! The former communications minister, Mr Turnbull, says he's here! In 2013, the Prime Minister made it clear that households and small businesses who wanted to upgrade their node copper connection to fibre would need to pay around $3,000. But in anything this government does with money, you know it's going to be stuffed up. We spoke to Gisborne residents this week who had tried to upgrade their second-rate NBN connections. They were told it was going to cost $85,264 for a fibre connection. Another resident in Sunbury was quoted $13,746 to make the switch. Now, maths is not this government's forteânumbers are not the Prime Minister's strengthâbut this is an absolute joke. Once again, the Prime Minister has broken his promises, leaving towns in the lurch. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I rise today to talk about a suburb in my electorateâthe suburb of North Lakes in the Moreton Bay Regional Council area. North Lakes was originally part of Mango Hill and was gazetted as a suburb in 2006. If you go to the last census, you will see that there were almost 22,000 people living in North Lakes. I suspect there are a lot more today. In its description of North Lakes and its geography, Wikipedia says:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The suburb is mostly made up of newly developed housing around the North Lakes Golf Course.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The North Lakes golf course is what I will be talking about. Last month there was an announcement that the owner was in negotiations to sell the golf course to a developer who wants to develop retirement living and a nursing home development on two sections of the golf course. It's unclear what would happen to the rest of the land. What is certain is that the golf course as we know it would cease to exist. Many people that I represent bought in North Lakes, not just on the course but in the surrounding communities, to be around the North Lakes golf course and Lake Eden.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very quickly the community has galvanised behind this to make sure that the North Lakes golf club is saved. I've been very clear in speaking to the golf course owner, Adam Simpson, that I don't support the sale of the course for development. I want it to remain a golf course because, quite frankly, North Lakes is already lacking in sporting facilities. Clubs like North Lakes Blues netball club need a new home, as do the Eels AFL club. I'm also pushing for Mango Hill State High School to incorporate a swimming pool, because there is no swimming club other than a small one at North Lakes state high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank those committee members and the 3,000 or so people who have joined the 'save North Lakes golf club' campaign. There have been a couple of rallies, one of which I was able to speak at. The community has said really loudly and clearly: 'We want the golf course to remain.' I thank committee members Phillip Carlson, Amy Carlson, Craig Brown, Matt Williamson, Ryan Harris, Andrew Cathcart, Jill Anschau, Brad Lawler, Katrina Daff and Carl Pollard, who have been very strong in leading the way. I say to the community: I'm with you. I want to see the golf club remain a golf club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today Phillip Carlson spoke to Moreton Bay Regional Council. The committee are pushing for the development application, when it's submitted, to be rejected or for the council to vote no. I thank those councillors I've spoken to asking them to reject the DA. I say to the owner and the VRG retirement group: don't bother submitting a DA. We don't want it in that community. We want it to remain a golf course, just like Redcliffe Golf Club is a community run golf course owned by the council and is making a profit every year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I rise today to state my concerns about the Anglican Church's plans to sell 108 properties in Tasmania, including 76 churches, many of them in my electorate of Lyons. The Anglican Church says it is selling the properties, which also include cemeteries, halls, residences and vacant blocks, to raise the funds needed to pay survivors of sexual abuse under the National Redress Scheme. The sales are expected to raise $20 million, just $4.7 million of which will go to the diocese's $8.6 million redress contributionâanother $2.8 million would come from church funds and $1.1 million from congregation contributions. Three-quarters of the proceeds of the property salesâ$15.3 million of the $20 million totalâis flagged for other church operations and restructuring. Just $4.7 million is earmarked for redress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it offensive that the Anglican Church hierarchy is using national redress as political cover for these property sales. Every member in this place supports redress and the need for institutions to compensate survivors of child sexual abuse. I applaud the diocese for recognising its responsibility to provide redress, but to say all of these property sales are needed to achieve it and then to earmark only one-quarter of the proceeds is a gross violation of public trust and sentiment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The church's plans have sparked a storm of protest across regional Tasmania, especially in my electorate, where a meeting was held earlier this year in the town of Kempton. Another meeting is planned for Campbell Town in the near future. I say to those watching this broadcast that the details of that Campbell Town meeting will be on my social media, on my Facebook page, as soon as possible, and anybody who is concerned about the sale of these churches and properties should certainly get along to one of these meetings. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular concern is the uncertainty surrounding the future of cemeteries caught up in the sales process. Across Lyons, there are cemeteries containing the remains of people who represent the best of our past, such as Victoria Cross recipient Trooper John Hutton Bisdee, who is buried at Jericho, a tiny cemetery attached to a small and isolated church that is listed for sale. Families and community members want to know if they will retain visitation rights. What about those who have prepurchased plots to be put to rest next to their loved ones? If cemeteries are sold to private interests, will there be legal requirements for maintenance and public access? Who assumes public liability? These are all legitimate questions that need clear answers. The reasons for the sales might be legitimate, but they should not be using national redress as political cover.</span>

There are theatrical performances there. There are lots of classes for kids. Various musical events take place there. It's a terrific institution in our community. It's been there since 1977. It was great to meet with Daniel Potter, the CEO, and Cathy Nisbet, who is now the develo;lpment manager, having moved from Kogarah Community Services. I'm really pleased that, as a government, we've been able to assist Shopfront with its important work, through grants through the Australia Council and a substantial contribution to the big redevelopment and renovation that's going on down there at Shopfront at the moment, which is going to create the best performing arts space in the St George area, certainly. It's a terrific organisation, and I want to thank Daniel Potter for everything he does, including judging the annual Banks Junior Short Film Contest. Shopfront is a great organisation, and I am always pleased to visit and do everything that we sensibly can to assist.</span>

There are 135 active members at Padstow Probus, and there's a waiting list as well. That is a reflection of what a great group of people it is. There's so much activity, lots of outings and even overseas trips from Padstow Probus. They are putting so much back into Padstow. It's been around since 2004. May it exist for many decades to come.

They make polystyrene blocks for house insulation. They have written to my office asking a very simple question: how can small business survive? They've detailed that their energy bill has increased by 117 per cent. From the start of May to the end of May this year, Independent Pods were charged almost $19,500. They told me that a year ago, in May 2017, their energy bill was just $8,500. The director of Independent Pods, Ross MacDonald, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Independent Pods is a relatively new business â¦ looking at expanding its production and as a result its employment opportunities. However the drastic rise in electricity costs (virtually doubled from 12 months ago) provides us with significant challenges to absorb such a cost increase and remain sustainable and compromises our ability to invest in our growth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know that the Turnbull government's National Energy Guarantee is grossly inadequate. Malcolm Turnbull's 26 per cent emissions target plan will lead to a collapse in renewable energy investment. It will cost thousands of renewable energy jobs and it will stifle the inevitable transition to renewable energy which is already underway. That is the legacy the Turnbull government has left to the people of Geelong over the last five years. What Australian households and businesses need to reduce power bills, to reduce pollution and to have energy security is investment in renewables, which will only be driven by Labor's commitment to a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report released this year by electricity sector experts RepuTex confirms that the government's 26 per cent emissions target under the NEG will have 'a negligible impact in driving any new renewables investment', whereas a 45 per cent emission reduction target would drive renewable energy investment up to 50 per cent of generation by 2030.</span>

Only Labor will move to restore certainty to the large-scale renewable energy industry. Only a Shorten Labor government will work with industry, unions and other stakeholders to develop a plan for the orderly transition to renewables. Only Labor will look after the workers and communities affected by the modernisation of our electricity generation system. More renewable energy leads to lower prices for consumers and for small businesses.</span>

Time and time again you will see members of the House come into this chamber and the chamber below and speak about identical topics. We are living in an environment where the National Energy Guarantee is topical, and it is a topic which resonates with both sides of the House with the most utmost passion. What both sides of the House agree on is that we're both in pursuit of downward pressure on electricity prices, because it is those who win that argument, who can prove and deliver, who give their party the best opportunity to govern at the next election. That's the hardcore reality.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reality is when we go back to our electorates. You stand and you commit to a 15-minute conversation in a town hall with 500 in the room and you start talking about the National Energy Guarantee. By the time you've got to the end of your opening paragraph, most of the room are rolling their eyes over it and have tapped out. Unless you are across it, it is a complicated and in-depth topic, and I don't profess to be. I have been speaking about it and trying to understand it for the last month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I speak in those town halls, what do I get back from my constituentsâconstituents like Mal and Glenn Abbott, who are irrigators from farms in my electorate? I remember Glenn Abbot telling me a story once. He went to the letterbox, grabbed his electricity bill and opened it at the letterbox. He was sitting in his Toyota and he had to open the doorâhe was physically sick to see the increases in his bills. Quite an animated description, but it gives a sense of how urgently the public want us to deal with this. We just have a different mechanism as to how we're going to get there. The previous speaker articulately outlined that Labor has a policy that looks at 50 per cent renewables. We have a greater mix, where we see coal as a sufficient baseload power source that will be part of the generation source into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak about the spot price and some of the inequities that arise as a result of the spot price. If I have 100 megawatts that I want to procure, and I get the first lot at 80, and I get the next lot at 40 and the next lot at 60, ultimately, in a reverse auction I have to pay everyone the exact same price. There is market failure. This government is about setting to right that wrong.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  There is a widening gap in our society and the government doesn't seem to see it. The government seems to disregard vulnerable people and the hardworking staff who are trying to do their jobs to support them. It continues to cut and outsource Centrelink jobs and will not lift the staffing cap on the National Disability Insurance Agency. This means workers in those agencies are under pressure, and the people who need their help wait longer and longer. They wait for payments. Their phone calls go unanswered. They can't go online. Their frustration grows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How long is acceptable for an older Australian to wait for an age pension? We are told the official time is 49 days, but in the experience of older Australians in my electorate it is much longer than that. Four months appears to be the absolute minimum for constituents who seek help from my office; four months without any income. Four months without access to a healthcare card, which means older Australians, many of whom are on multiple medications, have to pay up to $39.50 for a prescription instead of $6.40. These waits are forcing older Australians to choose between taking their medications and putting food on the table or turning on the heater.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I was pleased to welcome Labor's shadow minister for human services, the member for Barton, to my electorate. During her visit, we learnt a bit more about just why these delays in processing age pensions, carer payments and student payments are happening. We heard firsthand from Centrelink staff. We heard about high workloads, overtime to clear the backlog, and an IT system that just can't cope. We heard that an age pension application can sit in the Centrelink inbox for 49 days before anybody even looks at it. How is this acceptable? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Prime Minister axed 1,180 jobs from Centrelink, and age pension and carer payment processing times blew out. This year he axed a further 1,280 jobs from Centrelink and outsourced a further 1,250 to labour hire. This government is privatising Centrelink jobs and making it harder for vulnerable Australians to get help. Centrelink needs permanent full-time staff trained to manage the complex issues facing income support recipients. Labor will deliver these jobs. A Shorten Labor government will invest $196 million in 1,200 new permanent full-time Department of Human Services staff around the country, reducing waiting times and boosting services. These new jobs will help vulnerable people, improve services and boost local economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just Centrelink staff who are struggling. I also met with NDIS participants and their carers battling bureaucracy. It is clear there are not enough staff to process NDIS packages and reviews and that this is a direct result of the government's staffing cap. It is clear that more skilled and experienced staff are needed to deal with delays and prevent mistakes and unnecessary reviews. The NDIS has been life changing for many people on the coast, but it's important that we do not ignore the problems. The government must lift its staffing cap on the NDIA, to make sure there are enough staff to help participants get the best outcomes. It's what disability advocates have been calling for, and it's what we'll do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>): Last week, the Prime Minister visited my electorate of Swan, in the great state of Western Australia. It was a fantastic morning. The first stop was a visit to Kent Street Senior High School to launch National Science Week, which is running from 11 to 19 August. National Science Week is an annual celebration of science and technology and provides an opportunity for us to recognise the contributions made by our Australian scientists. One of those scientists is Kent Street Senior High School's very own science teacher Susie Urbaniak. In 2016 Susie was awarded the Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools. Two years on, it was great for them to catch up and for the Prime Minister to meet her enthusiastic class of science students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next stop was Lathlain Park, to check out the progress of the redevelopment. In 2016 the coalition government provided $13 million towards the $68 million development of the park, to support jobs and economic growth in the Victoria Park area. I've spoken about this key development within my electorate a number of times in this chamber, and I'm pleased to update the House. It is looking fantastic, and I know the Swan community are eager to see the finished product. While at Lathlain Park, the home of Perth Demons, the Prime Minister and I met up with the Perth Football Club CEO, Marty Atkins, and the club president, Daryle Mann, and inspected the Perth Football Club grandstand, which is anything but grand. The existing grandstand is worn and decrepit and riddled with concrete cancer. The structure is well and truly in need of replacing. It was built in 1959ânot a bad year, but it's something that we need to replace and bring into the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final stop on the tour of Swan was to a local business, Thermo King West in Welshpoolâbelieve it or not, just streets away from where I started my first business, back in the 1980s. Steve Da Rui owns and runs his family business and last year was a recipient of a $20,000 grant under our government's Entrepreneurs' Program. The Entrepreneurs' Program provided Mr Da Rui with access to a business mentor who came in every week for a year to work with him, to get the processes right for his business. Steve explained to the Prime Minister that he'd struggled initially, but, with the enterprise part of the business, they've been able to develop not only their apprenticeship scheme but also their senior technicians, every week. It's allowed them to streamline their processes and come back 12 months later with a far more effective structure. I'd like to congratulate Steve on his success and thank him for hosting us last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the Prime Minister again for joining me to see just three of the exciting things that are going on in Swan. While we were at Perth Football Club, we managed to meet with the local butchers from Exclusive Meats, who are running the 'Every butcher needs a farmer' program, which will be launched on 1 September, with barbecues outside the independent butchers, to raise money for drought-stricken farmers in New South Wales.</span>

Before I go on to make some remarks about the report and its significance for my electorate and the Northern Territory, I just want to acknowledge the good work of the committee and particularly the member for Leichhardt, the chair, and my friend and colleague the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, the deputy chair, for their important work on this report.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of tourism to the Northern Territory is massive, with 1.5 million domestic visitors and around 300,000 international visitors in 2017. In the Northern Territory, about 15Â½ thousand Territorians are employed either directly or indirectly in tourism, amounting to a whopping 11 per cent of the NT's total workforce. The NT government believes that tourism can be a $2.2 billion contributor to the Territory's economy by 2020, given the right support. There is no shortage of potential in northern Australia's tourism industry, and there is plenty in the Northern Territory. If managed properly, and if the challenges addressed in the report are met, Territory attractions like Uluru, Kakadu and Litchfield national parks can lead to increased international and domestic visitation, as well as more tourists returning for repeat visits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently ran a tourism ideas-fest on the NT and Darwin in my electorate, where people came along and pitched their tourism ideasâand there were certainly plenty of those. But it requires investment, and it requires commitment. It requires the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, for example, to start supporting tourism in the NT.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that a Shorten Labor government will inject $1 billion of the NAIF's funds into a northern Australia tourism infrastructure fund to provide financing and concessional loans to build new tourism infrastructure in northern Australia. We know that there is great international and domestic demand for unique cultural experiences. Obviously, the Northern Territory provides the perfect opportunity to grow the developing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism ventures, as do Northern Queensland and the Kimberley. This international interest in our unique cultural experiences was confirmed when I ran another event recently, a forum that looked at how we can leverage off the direct flights between Darwin and mainland China that have now begun with Donghai Airlines. We ran that event to capture the lessons learned from the first month of direct flights from Darwin to mainland China, and Chinese tourists' interest in those unique experiences was absolutely confirmed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the report made 33 well-thought-out recommendations, but I am yet to see much from the government in terms of leadership on them. Recommendation 1, for example, states that the Darwin City Deal should be progressed as a matter of urgency. The current government and the current cities minister are not showing much urgency. In fact, it has been 444 days since the MOU for a City Deal between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government, a City Deal for Darwin, was signed. Other jurisdictions have had their City Deal confirmed much more quickly than that. Having provided all the information that the Commonwealth needs to confirm the City Deal, we are at a loss to understand why, after 445 days, the Prime Minister is unable to get on a plane, fly past the south, get into the Territory and just sign the deal. There is a huge opportunity in Darwin for business events. So the business community in Darwin is joining the call for the Prime Minister to visit Darwin, sign the City Deal and show some sort of interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not going to wait for the Prime Minister to grace us with his presence in Darwin; we are bringing Darwin and the Northern Territory's business community to Parliament House when we again run the Facing North evening on 19 September this year. The economic contribution that we are missing out on in, for example, business events has been estimated to be worth well over $70 million. But it could be worth much more if that City Deal was confirmed and we could get on with building some more infrastructure in our city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those listening that if you haven't visited the NT, and if you haven't got out to Kakadu, you are really missing out. As Daryl Somers once said, 'if you never never go you'll never never know'. It's as true today as it was back then. I extend an invitation to the nation to get up to the Territory and visit our iconic parks. But what I want to say to those opposite is that the cuts to Kakadu National Park have meant that, even though the brand of Kakadu is well known, it is starting to look tired. It requires some effort and some input and some priority from the federal government. I am pleased to say that during the winter recess the shadow minister for northern Australia and member for Blaxland, Jason Clare, visited the Top End not once but twice, including getting out to Jabiru and understanding a bit more about what we need to polish the jewel in the Northern Territory's tourism crown that is Kakadu. Unfortunately we can't wait until we win the lotteryâlike the Great Barrier Reef Foundation! We are just asking for some funding for Kakadu. It needs some federal investment. We need the cuts to national park funding to cease. We need some investment but, unfortunately, we have seen nothing so far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point of feedback that I have received from the consultations I have been doing with the tourism industry in the Top End and from the surveys coming back from the Chinese tourists on the direct flights with Donghai is that they are very interested in Australia and the Top End's World War II military history. Our military heritage is of increasing importance to the Darwin economy as a new generation of Australians take a keen interest in the defence of Australia in the two world wars. In particular, they want to visit Australia's Pearl Harborâwhich, of course, is our city, Darwin, the capital of the north. The bombing was across the breadth of northern Australia. We are working on developing more tourism opportunities so that Australians can come on that pilgrimage to the north and understand our World War II history and see the resilience of a people in the Top End that rebuilt Darwin not just once but twiceâafter the Japanese bombings and after Cyclone Tracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members would have heard me speak in the past about the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rushcutter</span>. I am happy to be able to report to the House that we succeeded in getting the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rushcutter</span>, the World War II patrol boat, off the beach in Darwin Harbour and into a cradle. It is now out of the water and supported in a cradle. We will soon begin the restoration of that incredible piece of our maritime and military history. Again, I commend the committee and, in particular, the member for Lingiari for the work on this report, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orizonsâunleashing our tourism potential</span>, and I do so as the shadow minister for tourism. In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Island Home</span>, Tim Winton said this about Australia:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's good for the spirit, to be reminded as an individual or a community that there will always be something bigger, older, richer and more complex than ourselves to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Northern Australia is home to vast and divergent landscapes, from the rainforests of the Daintree to the rocky outcrops of Kakadu and the brilliant white beaches of Broome. But we are also home to the oldest living culture in the world, our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have passed down their stories and practices through each generation. We are indeed privileged to be part of that culture. Northern Australia has so much to offer, both to its residents and to people from other parts of Australia, such as myself from Sydney, but also to international visitors. It is a very special place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has a responsibility to work with state and local governments, as well as businesses and communities, to unlock the tourism potential of northern Australia. We know that tourism is a super growth sector. It employs one million Australians and generates more than $97 billion in economic activity a year. The Great Barrier Reef alone supports nearly 60,000 jobs in Australia. In the year ending March 2018, Australia received 8.3 million international visitors, up eight per cent, with a visitor spend of $42.3 billion. But this increase is, of course, not evenly shared around the nation. We need to ensure that cities, towns and smaller communities across northern Australia benefit from any policy actions the federal government takes as a consequence of this report. The fact is that, at the moment, the approach of the government is one that sometimes just undermines tourism opportunities in northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, I was contacted by the Cairns based tourism operator Coral Expeditions. It's a cruise company whose vessels are crewed by Australians. They currently employ 150 seafarers, contribute to the development of skills and employment in the Australian maritime industry in northern Australia and deliver economic and community benefits. For 34 years this proud Australian business has managed to remain viable and is now planning to invest some $100 million over the next three years to acquire two additional vessels. To operate those vessels, they intend to recruit an additional 70 Australian seafarersâmore local jobs. Their most popular cruises are to the waters around the Kimberley, Arnhem Land and the Cape York regions. They also offer expeditions along the length of the Great Barrier Reef. However, if the bill that is now being discussed before this House were to become law, it would jeopardise not only Coral Expedition's expansion plans and the jobs that it would create but, more significantly, the very existence of Australian based companies like themselves. In the words of the company's group general manager, Mark Fifield, and its commercial director, Jeff Gillies, this piece of legislation will have the unintended consequence of killing off the growing and globally respected Australian flagged expedition cruise ship industry. This will have a significant negative impact on sustainable tourism and the environment in remote and sensitive coastal areas in Australia and on the revival of Australian seafaring. The letter concludes with this simple request: 'We urge that the current restrictions on coastal trading for foreign flagged passenger ships be maintained in order to facilitate the steady and sustainable development of coastal tourism and the Australian seafaring industry.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that echoes the calls from True North Adventure Cruises, based in north-west Western Australia. Bill Melby came and gave evidence in 2015 during the debate that occurred about the government's coastal trading legislationâthe last time it was defeated. He warned the government that those changes would put him out of business. The government advised Mr Melby to sack his crew, reflag overseas and hire a foreign crew! This is the approach towards jobs in northern Australia of those opposite, particularly in the tourism sector. And this is high-value tourism. This is an industry that we should be cherishing, and yet it's dismissed by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also concerned about the recommendations in this report to remove cabotage when it comes to the aviation sector: recommendations 9 and 30. This would allow foreign airlines to fly domestic routes in northern Australia, having, of course, foreign crews being paid foreign wages, just like the government's approach towards the shipping sector. Such a policy would have in the very short-term a devastating impact on the tourism sector and on access, particularly in the smaller regional towns around northern Australia. What we have at the moment are the airlines, such as Qantas and Virgin, and other smaller airlines, like Airnorth, saying very clearly that what we would have is cherrypicking from overseas airlines in order to remove some of the cross-subsidisation that occurs on some of the smaller routes that fly around northern Australia. We certainly wouldn't have any commercial flights into places in Far North Queensland like Weipa and Normanton, or Mount Isa and Cloncurry for that matter. They would simply disappear, let alone Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory or Kununurra in Western Australia. All of these destinations would be under pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is ideology before reality. We know that Australia already has the most liberal aviation regime in the world. The fact is that as part of our aviation white paper foreign airlines can gain greater access to the capital cities, to the primary international airportsâBrisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perthâif they're prepared to fly through those secondary international airports, be they Darwin, Cairns, Broome or Townsville. Then those opportunities are available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the fact is that we also need to support Indigenous tourism. I sat down in Western Australia recently for a round table, and WAITOC, the Western Australia Indigenous Tourism Operators Council, is a great example of Indigenous communities coming together and promoting experiences, particularly in remote areas, where people's lives could be enriched, literally, by having that experience. At the same time that is creating jobs for people in those regional communities, particularly Indigenous Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the opportunities that are there in the Northern Territory and in Far North Queensland are indeed substantial. We do need to look at the particular needs, as the previous speaker, the member for Solomon, said about Kakadu. I know that the member for Lingiari is a passionate supporter of Kakadu National Park and the opportunities that need to be taken at the time when we have withdrawal of mining around Jabiru. That is an opportunity; it's a challenge, but done right it can create economic opportunity for those communities. Indeed, that iconic site of Kakadu National Park is so importantâthat people are able to experience that wonderful part of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more that we can do, but I say to the parliament that Labor is prepared to work with the government and, importantly, with communities to maximise employment outcomes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia I had the privilege to travel across northern Australia, including the territories of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands, to experience firsthand the challenges that communities are facing in developing tourism and employment opportunities for our First Nations people and local residents. Our committee talked with and listened to a wide range of community members, including First Nations people, business owners and industry and community groups, in order to deliver the final reportâ<span style="font-style:italic;">Northern horizons: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nleashing our tourism potential</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very quickly it became very obvious to me that, regardless of the location, the issues across northern Australia were very similar. Further growth in development is dependent upon investment in vital infrastructure that will encourage and deliver growth opportunities for all. It is no exaggeration to say that northern Australia has a significant role to play in the further development of our growth in and connection with the Asia-Pacific region. This is not only in the area of tourism. Our community-based services and agricultural, health, education and tourism industries all create opportunities for imports and exports, which in turn make a significant contribution to the nation's economy. Developing northern Australia across a diverse range of industries and sectors will also create numerous secure, quality and well-paid jobs for local communities, including apprenticeships and traineeships for our young people, including our First Nations youth. It will also open up a diverse range of business opportunities for First Nations people and other community members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At Nitmilukâwhich is the traditional owners', the Jawoyn people's, name for Katherine GorgeâI saw firsthand an inspirational collaboration between the Territory government, national parks and the Jawoyn people in a professional and diverse tourism operation that is creating local jobs for First Nations people and other community members. The challenges and barriers to developing tourism in northern Australia are clearly evident. But in my view they are not unsurmountable, which is evident in the <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orthern horizons: unleashing our tourism potential </span>report. As a North Queenslander, I take an enormous amount of pride in northern Australia and its enormous potential. But I also acknowledge that success, and a fair go for all, in northern Australia will require a collaborative approach across the jurisdictions of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. We will be much more successful if we leverage off each other rather than compete with each other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report on the inquiry into opportunities and methods of stimulating the tourism industry in northern Australia demonstrates the clear need for the government to prioritise policy development and expenditure in the north, as clearly identified in the 33 recommendations. The single most significant issue that I noted at every hearing that I attended, regardless of the location, was access to timely, reliable and affordable flights. The release of this report is quite timely for North Queensland as this week a delegation of 90 political, business and community leaders from the north have arrived in Canberra to showcase our wonderful part of the country. They are here to have their voices heard and to network with the nation's politicians to discuss the priorities that we believe we need to move forward in our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mayors from Townsville, Charters Towers, Hinchinbrook, Palm Island and the Burdekin are joining representatives from a range of business sectors, including the tourism sector, to discuss infrastructure projects that are vital for the north to grow and thrive into the future. The Townsville Enterprise Ltd Northern Queensland delegation has prepared a thoughtful list of priorities that have been agreed to across the northern region. Many of the identified priorities on the list will not be a surprise to the Turnbull government. It will be no surprise to the Turnbull government that the list of priorities for Townsville includes the following infrastructure projects. It includes $75 million for the Townsville port expansion and a long-term water security solution. We need the government to match Labor's commitment of $100 million for stage 2 of the Burdekin pipeline. On energy infrastructure, we also need the Turnbull government to match Labor's commitment of $200 million to develop hydro energy on the Burdekin Falls Dam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor understands that Townsville is the largest city in northern Australia, with a capacity and willingness to play a central role in the development of northern Australia. But we need real funding and vital infrastructure, not only in my community but across northern Australia. Infrastructure such as I have mentioned will boost Townsville's economy, increase business confidence and expand our connections in the Asia-Pacific, all of which will create secure local jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the Turnbull government has refused to invest one single cent into the infrastructure projects I have mentioned, which is simply unacceptable. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern horizons: unleashing our tourism</span> potential report is now a catalyst for the Turnbull government to get behind the development of northern Australia and start allocating infrastructure funds to the northern Australia regions. The future of our region and northern Australia must not be used as a political football, because developing the northern part of this country is far too important. Northern Australia needs real investmentâand we need it now, not just at election time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tourism industry already makes a significant contribution to employment and the economy in the north. In 2014-15, over 17 million tourists visited Australia and spent over $9.9 billion. However, northern Australia only attracts a small portion of overall visits to Australia. In 2013-14, approximately 9.3 per cent of international overnight stays and 12.7 percent of domestic overnight stays were in northern Australia. This only suggests that there are opportunities to expand the tourism industry to support increased visitation and expenditure across the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to stimulate tourism growth in northern Australia the committee identified a need to increase visitor awareness of northern Australia tourism destinations; to improve access to the north and between major tourism attractions; and to support the tourism industry to develop products, experiences and attractions on the ground that tourists will want to take the time to visit and, more importantly, to come back to again. The committee has made 33 recommendations, as I said, which focus on marketing, coordination, upgrading transport and telecommunications infrastructure, streamlining regulatory processes for tourism businesses, and enhancing and planning the coordination of tourism destinations and attractions across the north. I'm proud to say that Labor has committed $1 billion from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to the Northern Australia Tourism Infrastructure Fund to ensure that we have the much-needed investment to grow tourism in northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was born, raised, educated and married in Townsville. It is where my husband and I have raised our children. I have called Townsville home my entire life, apart from 3.5 years when I moved overseas and south for further studies. Many years ago Townsville was a tourism hub. We were the Mecca for tourists to visit, stay and play. However, due to lack of investment and vision, Townsville's tourism goldmine has been relocated to our neighbour's regions around Cairns. There is an untapped potential for Townsville's tourism market. We have the Great Barrier Reef on our front doorstep. Magnetic Island, one of Australia's top 15 islands, is located only minutes away. We have the cultural historyâa significant cultural historyâof our First Nations people on Palm Island, and we have the numerous garrison sites around our town. Why would you not invest in growing and expanding tourism in Townsville?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Townsville port expansion project is a no-brainer project and is absolutely essential for our tourism industry to grow. At present, Townsville can only dock cruise ships carrying 1,500 people. If the port widening project went ahead our city would be able to accept larger ships carrying over 3,000 passengers. This would only further benefit our tourism industry, not to mention increasing income for our accommodation and hospitality businesses. Cruise tourism is the world's fastest growing tourism sector, which is why Townsville must play a role and have our port expanded. To do this we need the Turnbull government to match Labor's commitment of $75 million to the port expansion project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to say that I hope that the government takes seriously the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Horizonsâunleashing our tourism potential</span> that has just been produced, because this will give northern Australia the infrastructure that is vital to the growth and further development of our regions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to be able to speak to this interim report on <span style="font-style:italic;">Constitutional </span><span style="font-style:italic;">recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span> and, as a member of the joint committee, with the other members of the committee, to say to the Australian community that we've still got a lot of work to do. This is an interim report. It sets down some markers for us, but it doesn't finalise the questions which we've been asked to respond to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I acknowledge the way in which the work of the committee has been undertaken and congratulate both of the co-chairsâSenator Patrick Dodson, from the Labor Party, and the member for Berowra, Mr Leeserâfor the way in which they've ensured that we have had a collegiate and collaborative approach to the deliberations of the committee and to the questioning of witnesses and interviewing of people. This committee has a genuine desire to try as far as possible to come up with what will be a comprehensive and bipartisan report with recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might well be that, at the end of the day, we can't agree on everything. But I suspect there will be significant agreement over a range of questions. I point initially to the foreword of the report, which has been co-signed by both the co-chairs. On page vii, it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We support constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as part of the broader project of reconciliation and recognition of their unique status in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is a very profound and important statement for this committee to make. It is being said with a backdrop of much public debate around the Uluru Statement from the Heart from Central Australia. The next paragraph of that forewordâand I think this explains a great dealâsays:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We understand the frustration about the length of time taken to advance these issues. However, we also note that the Uluru Statement from the Heart represents a major change in the direction of the debate on constitutional recognition with its proposals for a voice, agreement making and truth telling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is true. At page viii, the report continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This interim report indicates our progress to date and outlines what we will be doing next. It sets out the key areas of inquiry, asking specific questions on what a voice could strive for and how it would be designed. It acknowledges that, whatever form future proposals may take, a voice must be legitimate, representative and agreed between the parliament and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, a paragraph or so later, it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the broader community to make submissions examining the principles and models outlined in chapters 3 and 4 and addressing the questions we pose in chapter 7.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to chapter 7 because it is the questions that we need to have addressed in the next processes of deliberation up until we table a report in November. This, I think, is an important statement. It flows from, in many ways, the recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are sick of having things done to them, or for them, without ownership of those things. At 7.27, the committee acknowledges that much of the work to be done should be led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The committee also acknowledges that, in any co-design process, the government should take an active role in participating in any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander led consultations so that the outcomes of the consultations are co-owned by the government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and government can have a richer appreciation for the authentic perspective offered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is a fundamental issue, because we have got to have an understanding that the outcomes of these discussions and consultations need to be co-owned. I had the experience in a previous parliament of engaging in a similar process to establish the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan. What we did then was partner with NACCHO, the peak Aboriginal health organisation, and the First Peoples Congress to hold 17 or 18 consultations around the country. They were led by the co-chair of the congress and by the chair of NACCHO, and they were facilitated by an Aboriginal person. I was there at many of them but as a participantâas someone there to listen, not tell. As a result, we ended up with a policy which was truly something that was done in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. And that is what we seek here. This will not work unless the outcomes of our deliberations are seen to be fair, reasonable and accepted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that backdrop, we've got to understand thatâwhilst it's up to us to have opinions, and we may have themâat the end of the day, what this committee needs to do is to deliberate over what has been put to it. That includes the detail of what a voice might look like. But, sadlyâand this is something which I hope can be rectifiedâwe've had the Prime Minister, as recently as last week, repeat something which he said after the Uluru statement was first released: that he was opposed to the idea of a body elected only by Aboriginal people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, as this report makes clear, there are other Aboriginal organisations around this country which purely elect their representatives. Four of them are Commonwealth statutory authorities. These four statutory authorities are the land councils in the Northern Territory, and their elections of their office-bearersâin the case of the Central Land Council, there's a statement in this report which refers to itâare oversighted and carried out by the Commonwealth Electoral Commission. The only people who can participate in those elections are Aboriginal peopleâjust as, when ATSIC existed, the only people who could participate in the elections of ATSIC regional councillors and ATSIC councillors generally were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is not new. And it's not hard to get your head around the idea that it is appropriate and fair for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, if they want to have a voiceâand they doâand whatever it might finally look like, that it be seen as their voice, not ours, and that it is something which should provide advice to parliament, which is what they have described, and that we should be mature enough to accept that as a reasonable possibility and an outcome which we can accept.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are questions about whether or not this voice, as it's described, should be designed first and then put to a referendum. The possibilities are endless as to what the voice might look like. And what this committee is now asking for is for people to put up the detail of what they propose in such a voice. I have ideas, and other people on the committee have ideas. But there are people in the community, both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have legitimate approaches to this and want their views understood and their proposals heardâjust as with proposals to amend the constitution. A series of proposals have been put to the committee about the possibility of amending the constitution. It's not beyond us to deal with that. Why would we want to be dog-whistling and saying that it's not fair or reasonable and that the Australian community will not accept it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come at a time when we've got an opportunity. We need to take hold of that opportunity and make sure that we accept and address the needs that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have asked us to. That includes the notion of truth-telling and a makarrata and the possibility of treaties. It is not hard, it is not unreasonable and it is something which should be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased with this report, and I think a number of people have been surprised by it, simply because of the depth of it and the considered way in which it has been put together in a very bipartisan way. And I recommend those who have an interest in this subject, including all members of parliament, to read this report closely, and, if they want to, provide submissions to us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I would firstly like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of my parliamentary colleagues the member for Barton, Linda Burney; Senator Patrick Dodson; Senator Malarndirri McCarthy; and the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon. I would also like to acknowledge the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs and Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, for his leadership. I also acknowledge the members on the other side of this committee, because, as the member for Lingiari said, this has been undertaken in a very bipartisan and positive way. The aforementioned members have worked tirelessly on this committee, and I believe that their work deserves thanks and recognition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beautiful Palm Island is in my electorate of Herbert. Palm Island is the largest discrete Aboriginal community in Australia, and I am honoured and proud to represent the traditional owners and custodians, the Manbarra and Bwgcolman people. In honour of Palm Island and in recognition of their centenary celebrations this year, I want to tell the story of Palm Island so that members in this place are aware of their very hurtful history and of how far the community has come, and why it is so important that a voice enshrined in parliament be achieved and that we have truth-telling and a makarrata. The truth of the history of Palm Island has not been spoken about by previous members in this place, so to show my support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart, truth-telling is a very critical and important component.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Palm Island was gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve in 1914. Chief Prosecutor J W Bleakley designated a specific role to Palm Island as a penitentiary for troublesome cases. The establishment of Palm Island was part of a wider national attempt to control the locals by taking control of all aspects of Aboriginal lives at a time now known as the protection era. In every state and territory laws were passed governing where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people could live and what they could and could not do. Representatives from over 47 tribes were displaced and sent to Palm Island for a variety of reasons, including as a prison sentence for troublemakers at other locations and as a result of the destruction of the whole river mission at Tully. More than 47 different language groups were sent to Palm, locating their camps in areas to mirror their positions on the mainland. The enforcement of so many tribes living in one place has generally been cited as a major cause for the unrest on Palm Island over the years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Palm Island became exile and punishment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who disobeyed the strict laws of the day or if people refused to comply with government policy. During this time, people worked for rations, not wages, and they worked hard. Apartheid-like arrangements of space and design extended to the schools, with a white school for the children of the officials and a native school on the opposite side of the road. Children were separated from parents. Men were separated from women by confinement to dormitories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By 1919, a jail was established on Palm Island to confine those who breached the stringent reserve regulations. The authority of Curry and all subsequent superintendents was reinforced by a team of police who operated as a private military force. Speaking out or practising Aboriginal culture and languages resulted in disciplinary action and retribution. Some of the disciplinary action included lengthy imprisonments, public humiliations and floggings of those the superintendent perceived as threatening his control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the scary and scarring history that Palm Island has risen from. It has only been through sheer resilience and determination, the fight for equality, justice and recognition, and the rebuilding of the island left by their ancestors over many years, that we have the Palm Island of today that we all know and love. The First Nations people of Palm Island deserve to be heard and they deserve for the truth to be told. They deserve the right to tell that truth. They also deserve to be recognised. In Herbert, the Manbarra people deserve to be recognised and heard as the traditional owners. The Bwgcolman people deserve to be recognised and heard as custodians. The Wulgurukaba people deserve to be recognised and heard. The Bindal people deserve to be recognised and heard. All of our First Nations people deserve to be recognised and heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Referendum Council has recommended is both plain and simple: for our First Nations to be both recognised and heard. Yet the Turnbull government has turned its back on the demands of our First Nations people to be heard and recognisedâleaving our First Nations people, right now, both distraught and heartbroken. Despite this, Labor fought to establish the joint select committee on constitutional recognition to keep the issue of constitutional recognition on the agenda of this parliament, and Labor has worked hard through the committee to get cross-party support for an Indigenous voice to parliament. Labor has made its point of view very clear: it is completely disrespectful to ask First Nations people for their views and thoughts regarding constitutional recognition and to then completely reject their feedback out of hand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Labor fought hard for the formation of the joint committee for constitutional recognition. The Labor-initiated committee has today released its interim report, putting calls for a voice for First Nations people back on the national agenda. The interim report puts all options back on the table, including constitutional change, the establishment of regional voices, truth-telling, a makarrata and a treaty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate regarding recognition and inclusion of our First Nations people has been going around in circles for far too many years now. The circuit-breaker for this debate was the Uluru Statement from the Heart. This report follows on from those recommendations, with the committee working closely with our First Nations people around the country. What is clear from the report is the committee's intent. For any change to occur it is important to build consensus both among the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and among the people in the general community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the report it is clear that many people support the principle of constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, but there is still much more to be done and further consultation and work to be carried out regarding the design of the recognition. It's important to get the detail of any change right. The committee is currently seeking additional submissions examining the principles and models outlined in the report and addressing the questions posed in the final chapter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee have also made their intentions clear to undertake further consultation, travelling to other parts of Australia to speak with both First Nations people and broader communities before delivering the final report in November. I implore the committee to visit Palm Island and the Torres Strait in order to engage with the wider North Queensland community. North Queensland has a large First Nations population, and their evidence to this committee would be highly valued. It would also show respect to those First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island organisations and community members to make a submission to this very important committee. Please note in particular the questions in chapter 7 that the committee is seeking further evidence, support and clarification on. This issue is far too important for people not to be involved in the conversation. We must get this right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our First Nations people have clearly articulated their position and they want the process started now in order to work towards reconciliation, recognition and truth-telling. Labor has always supported the Uluru Statement from the Heart and remains committed to working with First Nations people to ensure their voices are heard and respected, including through a voice to parliament. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull can no longer ignore our First Nations people. It's time for the Prime Minister to reverse his position and to back the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="123674" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McGOWAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I acknowledge the words of the member for Herbert and I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, for your support. I am a member of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. It gives me great pleasure to talk to this interim report and to call for the community to be involved. There are a few things I'd like to cover in my brief presentation. I'd like to talk about the committee; I'd like to talk about some of the key points in the report; and I'd like to finish by acknowledging an event that took place in my electorate that is relevant to the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, I come from north-east Victoria. One would not normally associate me with being on this committee, but I am so pleased to be there. I am one of 12 members. There have been five Labor members, five LNP members, one Independent memberâmeâand one Greens member. In my career to date this has probably been one of the nicest and most productive committees I've been on. 'Nicest' is probably really not a good word, but the level of respect and the contribution that the committee people want to make to doing this really well should give the people of Australia enormous confidence. It is a parliamentary select committee, so we actually report to the parliament. It has got senators and House of Representatives people working together. The sense of collegiality that exists has been just the most wonderful thing in my experience. I'm so pleased that this interim report is bipartisan. We've worked really closely together on it. It brings to the people of Australia our best efforts at this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's in the report? There are two things in particular that I'd like to bring to your attention. The first is a very strong commitment from the committee to what people have told usâthat they support the concept of a voice. What is that voice about? This is one of the areas where we're looking for more input, but in the report we talk about:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ The Voice will fulfil a number of functions including: serving as a representative body or bodies which provide mechanisms to consult and engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on policies, legislation, and services which affect them, leading to a reduction to barriers to access, to advance self-determination, and as a consequence lead to greater local decision making â¦ to a more unified and reconciled nation and be supported by the over whelming majority of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's no small ask of a voice. But I think it's really important to understand and know that that's encapsulated in the report, and that's what we're trying to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing I'd like to talk about in the report, which I find so useful, is what we call 'design principles'. Chapter 3 outlines the principles which we're looking at to design that voice. I want to use a quote which I think will help set the scene here:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there has been a shift in thinking from the primacy of a national voice to some combination of a local, regional, and national model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased with that, because I think if we can come up with a model that works at the local level, works at the regional level and works at the national level, and in each of those spheres of government, whether it be local government or regional government or the national government, we provide opportunities for voices to be heard, I think we'll be doing a really good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third part of the report that I'd like to bring to the chamber's attention, as mentioned by the member for Herbert, is that chapter 7 is called 'Committee comment'âas separate from some of the information we've been hearing during the inquiry. There are some very strong comments here from the committee and questions that we are seeking more information on. All of chapter 7 talks about this voice:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ common themes have emerged from the submissions and evidence presented to the Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is strong support for the concept of The Voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we haven't really got at the moment is what the voice will look like. What's the flesh on the bones? What's the detail? How do we actually make a national, regional and local voice work? So we're calling for greater input on some of those specific questions. I'm so looking forward to the next period when we actually get to flesh out the question: what are the models that could work and how can we work together on that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area I'd like to pick up on, other than the voice, is what we call truth-telling. The committee is of the view at this stage that there would be value in considering what truth-telling means and how it might work, both in formal and informal settings, at the national, regional and local level, where communities could come together to commemorate both positive and negative examples of the history of our communities. There are some ideas about how that might work. I know in my community there is an enormous interest in truth-telling and how it works both informally and formally. I'm particularly putting the call out to communities to give us some feedback on the voiceâin your community, how would you like to be involved in truth-telling? I know in Australia, we often talk about what happened in South Africa after apartheid and the truth-telling commission that was set up there. So there are some really useful examples that we might be able to look at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'll tell a short story about this report and how it's working in my electorate. I'd like to acknowledge Senator Malarndirri McCarthy. Senator McCarthy is on our committee. She's a senator from the Northern Territory. On Sunday, 29 July, she was invited to present the Kerferd oration, which is an annual oration that's held in my electorate of Indi, in Beechworth. Senator McCarthy was the orator. I was looking forward to seeing her and hearing her ideas, but what I didn't expect is that 500 people would turn up in Beechworth on a cold, wet, rainy day. The population of the whole Indigo shire is not much more than 500! It's a few thousand. But there was a huge number of people who turned up. Senator Malarndirri McCarthy did a fantastic speech and, at the end of it, there was a standing ovation. I don't think I could even begin to explain the feeling in the room of support for what we as a nation are trying to do with this committee. The community want us to do it well. They really want us to address the problems of the past and move on to a future where we as a nation can recognise our history and be proud of who we are and our long historyâ60,000-plus years we've had on this continentâand confidently step out into the future in the next 50 and 100 years, knowing that we are a united people, proud of our history and heritage and ready to really make the most of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So thank you so much, Senator McCarthy, for coming to Beechworth, to my electorate. Thank you so much for sharing your story and for being there for us. I say to my electorate: I'm on this committee and it's got my full commitment to do my very best for the future of Australia. I'm looking forward to representing my community in the next stage. The closing date for submissions to be in is 17 September. One of my other colleagues, the member for Farrer, Sussan Ley, is also on this committee. We share a boundary through the twin cities of Albury and Wodonga. We've invited the committee to come to Albury-Wodonga. We are hoping that will happen on Monday, 24 September. It will be an opportunity for both Albury-Wodonga and surrounding communities to talk to the committee about their aspirations for this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to acknowledge the work of the secretariatâsome enormous goodwill, far beyond what's expected in a normal job. You've done a fantastic piece of work in working with the committee and helping us do our job really well. Could you please pass that on to the relevant people. I am particularly looking forward to being in parliament on 29 November when we present our final report, which I'm really hoping will be unanimous and will do for the people of Australia what they're asking us to do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  It is a great pleasure to be able to get up and talk on the inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition Relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples as part of one of the big challenges this country faces around the legacy of constitutional recognition and what that means and what policies and proposals are being put forward for consideration by the parliament. I know that this issue has gone through lots of different iterations and that the focus nowâI think, rightlyâis on the importance of a national voice and a local voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to their communities, those allied communities, to state governments and to the Commonwealth government. I really welcome the shift in focus from the Constitution towards being I think, frankly, much more on outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin by congratulating all the people who were involved in this discussion. It is one of those issues that I dipped my toe in from time to time in my former capacity as Australia's Human Rights Commissioner, particularly working with my good old friend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda. That was around the need for some redress, whether it's through the Constitution or law, to give voice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I came to the discussion, actually, with a bit of scepticism as well as a deep-seated sense of optimismâscepticism about the idea that we needed to change the Constitution but optimism because I could see the goodwill of the Australian people. I know the member who spoke previously has reflected that from her own community, but I think it's shared across the whole of this great nation. It's an optimism about the capacity to redress past wrongs and an optimism that we, this generation, can get things right for the future. That's not a naive optimism where we just simply go off and spend money or resources willy-nilly to try to show our compassion or signal our virtue. But, actually, we believe that we're the generation that can fix and settle so many of the debates that have occurred, address those injustices and find a way that we as a nation can go forward together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I have optimism from spending time in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, comingâand I'm quite open about thisâfrom the relative naivety of a boy who grew up in the Mornington Peninsula in the great state of Victoria, where there were a very small number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I had a relative absence of understanding of the challenges being faced. To have spent time on the land and in the community helped me to understand the cultural connection, particularly to land, that's the foundation of who Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That that might finally be respected in the way that they have a voice and are represented in our country is so important, because that connection to country is central to identity. It is central to how people see their lives and it's where they build the foundations and building blocks of themselves into their nationhood and, ultimately, into our shared nationhood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm such an optimist, because I think that recognition is coming through in this interim report. What we see are people moving on from the idea that the best way to deal with all problems is through the prism of Canberra. We are shifting the focus into the prism of community. Let's not be under any misunderstanding that when we focus on people's hardship and challenges through community, it's not simply to dismiss the concern and say, 'It's their problem.' It's actually to say the reverse, 'It's their opportunity and empowerment.' Our job is to back them and to build the foundations of a sustainable community; to help people help themselves so they can stand on their own two feet and so they can be in the best position to help others also and to create the opportunities for the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what I see coming out of this interim committee report today: a recognition and understanding of the power of community as the foundation, not just of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's identity, connected directly to country, but the foundations for what is ultimately a national voice. The paper that was written by Warren Mundine under the banner of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy outlined what potential is realised when you move away from focusing on the Constitution and having big national bodies to focusing on the legitimacy that can come from local representative bodies connecting directly with other local representative bodies and local communities. The power is when they organise together and what can happen around their legitimacy to build state based bodies to engage with state governments. Critically, when you have local bodies voicing to and being part of state bodies you can ultimately get national bodies that carry the legitimacy and the voice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is so earth-shattering because of its strength and its connection to country that it can move the mountains of legislation in this place to advance the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what I see coming out of this report: a final recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have their sayâthat after the abolition of ATSIC, they have lost their voice to our country and they have lost their voice of their nationhood. No-one is trying to replicate ATSIC or trying to pretend that there weren't issues. But there is a need to give that voice back and to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be able to have their say on the affairs that affect them. If we're going to go down a model of local community based representation that can build up to Canberra, that voice will only be heard in this place because of its strength and because of the common agreement that will sit behind Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from country to Canberra. That is what is being realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is the most exciting proposal that I have seen in this place. I think it is the one in which we, as members of parliament, representing the whole of the country, can have the greatest affinity for. It is one where any voice that speaks to this nation has the weight that we would expect of it to be able to influence the national agenda appropriately and in a way that seeks to unite the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of different opinions about what the consequences are if we have legal structures or let legal voices into the Constitution. I don't want to indulge in some of those conversations right now, but one of the reasons that I've always been deeply concerned about a constitutional voice is not a reason that other people have come forward with. It is because I think a constitutional voice would falsely draw legitimacy simply from its place in the Constitution, and that wouldn't mean that it didn't have other work to do, whereas the organisation of people from country, through community groups and community representation, through states and nationhood, comes with a legitimacy that, frankly, the Constitution could never give, because it is truly representative and carries the weight and voice and representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee's interim report provides an opportunity for a reset and a refresh which is truly empowering for Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is something that is genuinely exciting, and I can only wish the committee all the best in their endeavours to keep up the work. I reiterate the statement of the member for Indi: the hope is that the final report will be a position that's shared by all members, one that can be made unanimously to the parliament, seeks to unite the nation and is part of a pathway to that final point of settlement about so many of the wrongs of the past, a pathway that we can move forward on together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265975" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAMB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  I've made it pretty clear where I stand when it comes to healthcare services and funding. I've made it pretty clear that I want the very best for our community. I've made it pretty clear that I want to make sure that each and every person in my community has access to the health care that they need and they deserve. We need a healthcare system that is affordable. We need a system that is accessible, that continually grows and evolves and that properly services what is really a changing community where I live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bad news is that, under this government, we've seen nothing but cuts and missteps. The people in Caboolture, Narangba, Woodford and Bribie Island deserve much better than this. They deserve a government that listens to what their needs are, a government that cares, a government that prioritises the health and wellbeing of the people it is meant to represent. But this government doesn't listen. This government doesn't care. If it did, it would have heard what the people of Longman resoundingly called for during the recent by-election campaign. It would have heard the people in Kallangur, Burpengary, Morayfield and Bellmere calling for a stop to cuts to health care. It would have heard just how furious the people of Longman were that the government is ripping $2.9 million of vital funding from our Caboolture Hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, though, we've got a Prime Minister covering his ears and denying any wrongdoing at all. Well, the message to the Prime Minister and his government is very clear. The people of Longman have spoken. They are sick of being sick. I've heard from doctors, nurses, patients and affected family members, and each of them has told me that they are tired of the government cuts. It's completely arrogant to ignore people like this. It's completely out of touch to tell people that they are wrong. This is the difference: the government cuts, but Labor invests and builds up. Unlike this government, that doesn't want to listen, Labor has listened. We will reverse this government's cuts to the Caboolture Hospital. We will reverse the $2.9 million ripped out of our Caboolture Hospital. We will do what we can to properly provide top-quality health outcomes for the people of my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's not a lot this government does to get it right on health, and if ever they finally end up on the right path you can always hold your breath, because it may get bundled. Take the government's My Health Record, for example. In theory, this should have been a game changer with the capacity to completely revolutionise healthcare delivery. To be very clear, Labor has always supported the electronic-health-record system. We have always supported that. I've spoken to a number of medical professionals about this matter in particular. With all of this government's endeavours, as we've seen, the My Health Record system, in its current state, is a far cry from the game changer that Australia had anticipated. Despite legislation initially underpinning My Health Record as an opt-in system, the government made the decision to instead shift to an opt-out model. Maybe through sheer arrogance, I don't know, the government was to incompetent to recognise that meant that privacy and security provisions would have to be strengthened by changing to this opt-out model. Although the government initially denied there were any issues, report after report has blatantly shown the opposite to be true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only through immense pressure from Labor and the medical community that the government reluctantly agreed to a number of changes, but the government's steps do not go far enough. There's still more to be done. We in Labor have been calling on the government to suspend the My Health Record rollout until they have cleaned up the mess. As usual, the government hasn't listened and the mess is still here. That's why Labor announced today that we will lead a Senate inquiry into the today My Health Record fiasco. We have long supported an electronic-health-record system, but this system the government has introduced failsâit absolutely fails. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be asking the crossbench to support a reference to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. This is the same committee that had previously inquired into the sale of Medicare numbers on the dark web, which was yet another government failure that put the security of Australia's medical data at risk. Knowing that their private information is secure is one of those things that Australians really like to have confidence in. What we saw with the Medicare numbers on the dark web was that people lost confidence in knowing that their personal information was secure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry that we're asking the crossbench to support will examine a range of concerns that relate to privacy and security, such as the adequacy of the system's login procedures and default settings. We intend that this inquiry will examine the government's decision to shift from that initial opt-in system to an opt-out system, and whether provisions were instated to properly prepare for this change. Australians want to have confidence in their personal information. Our health care and the health of our families and friends is very important, but just as important is the security of information when it comes to our medical history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot of issues in Longman when it comes to health care. We've got the Medicare freeze on pathology and medical imaging, which is still in place. That is really hurting people in Longman. We've had $2.9 million ripped out of Caboolture Hospital. Caboolture Hospital sees around 55,000 presentations in the emergency department every single year, so it is a very, very busy hospital. I know that the electorate has many more health needs, which is why a Labor government will invest in a $10 million chemotherapy service at Caboolture Hospital, so people who live in places like Woodford or Bribie Island don't have to drive past their very own hospital to get access to a chemotherapy service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other investment that a Shorten Labor government will deliver is an urgent care clinic on Bribie Island. Anybody who has been to Bribie Island knows just what a magical and beautiful part of the world it is. However, Bribie Island is a good 30-minute drive from Caboolture Hospital, and it has an older population. At the time of need, when you need to see a doctor on a weekend or at night it is imperative that you have access to the health care you need. A $17 million urgent-care clinic right on Bribie Island to make sure that the people who live there have access to a healthcare service is very welcome and long overdue. It is very much needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon this government to stop the cuts to health care. In the by-election people were very loud and very clear about their message to this government. They want their schools funded and they want their healthcare system, the services they need for their health care, funded. What they don't want is to see banks getting a handout from this government.</span>

But it's also an opportunity to pay honour to those who serve in our community and who have made a wonderful contribution to our community, to our state and ultimately to our nation. While it is now some time passed, it is important to acknowledge those wonderful citizens who had cause for celebration on the Queen's Birthday. No, I'm not talking about the thousands of Australians who get excited about the Queen's BirthdayâI think you might be one of them, Deputy Speaker Goodenoughâor those thousands of Australiansâ</span>

Of course, there are people who were excited about the Queen's Birthday in 2018 because they were part of the honours program and were recognised for their incredible community service. In Goldstein, with a community of people who care and who come together and support each other, there were plenty of recipients of awards for their contribution to their community. They deserve their full acknowledgment, and I want to congratulate them. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They included Mrs Kathryn Harby-Williams from Brighton East, who was recognised for her significant service to netball as a player, national captain, coach, commentator, board member and players' advocate. One of the things we are very proud of in our Goldstein community is the number not just of opportunities for women to play sport but, particularly, of our incredible netball teams, for which we need more investment in local support and facilities. Mrs Sara (Shirley) Glance from Brighton was recognised for her service to the community, including as co-chair of the Bayside Polio Support Group for 10 years and president of the National Council of Jewish Women of Australia Victoria. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing we are very proud of in our Goldstein community is the incredible contribution of Jewish communities. Goldstein is the electorate with the third-largest Jewish community in the nation. To my good friend Ian Robert Mence from Brighton my congratulations on the recognition of his service to the Brighton community, including as a former president of that stoic organisation the Rotary Club of Brighton, former board member of Mayflower Brighton, former president of the Les Twentyman Foundation and, of course, long-term member and, yes, supporter of the Liberal Party in Brighton. Ian, we say thank you so much for everything you do and congratulations on your Queen's Birthday honour.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="123674" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McGOWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  Colleagues, tonight I rise in this grievance debate to highlight the failing of our social services agencies in meeting their explicit intent to deliver social security payments and services to Australians. While the intent may be there, the system's rigidity, a push for automation and, ultimately, a lack of resources has meant that the Department of Human Services and, in particular, Centrelink are failing many Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue of great importance to my electorate, it's of great importance to me and it should be of great importance to the government. In my speech tonight, I'm going to address three points: the strong view of my electorate that we have a moral obligation to ensure that we assist those who suffer disadvantage; secondly, the stories of constituents who, in frustration, have come to my office, seeking help to negotiate the bureaucracy of the Centrelink system; and, finally, to note my intent to table legislation to establish a social service commission to provide independent advice to this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year, I undertake a budget impact statement in my electorate to seek feedback and advice and to ask for solutions from my community. In this year's budget survey, social security was identified in the top five of Indi's concerns. Twenty-four per cent of respondents rated social services as one of their top three issues, and 80 per cent of respondents ranked social services as either very important or fairly important. This report is the lived experience of the staff in my offices. On an almost daily basis, my staff, as I'm sure staff of other members' offices across the country do, help constituents struggling to negotiate Centrelink. And I need to point out here that my particular office and my staffâand I'm sure othersâhave a very good relationship with Centrelink and its staff. I applaud them and I'm very grateful for the help they provide me and my staff on many of the issues that are raised time and time again. However, I'm told about lost paperwork, inconsistent advice, long waiting times on the phone and in centres and delays in processing payments. And the most concerning part is that these issues are often contained within a single case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just give a case study from one of my constituents. They wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Cathy, I turned 65 in May 2017. As I was on Newstart, Centrelink staff encouraged me to put in my claim for the aged pension 3 months prior to me turning 65. Â Â Â In February 2017 (knowing I wold not receive a payment until after 65th birthday) I lodged my claim for aged pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On Friday 28th April I report my final Newstart â I had to ring as was unable to report on line. At the same time I asked about my claim for aged pension, I was reassured that there was no outstanding documentation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 28th June I called Centrelink and was advised the claim was not processed but was down for urgent action &amp; advised to call again the following week if I had not heard anything. On 7 July after hearing nothing I called again and was told there was a backlog &amp; my claim was noted as urgent &amp; to be actioned within 48 hours. On 12 July, called again &amp; was advised my application was still in the queue to be processed urgently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's shameful!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is from another constituent:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am writing to you to seek your support as an advocate and as my representative in the Federal Parliament, in an intolerable situation in which I find myself concerning the open ended delay in the approval process of granting me an aged pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is just a little of the story:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In late 2017 I went to the Centrelink offices to prepare for transition to aged pension. I was advised to also apply for the disability program pension. I was advised by Centrelink that the retirement age considered to eligible for aged pension was 65 years and 6 months - this date would not be till July 21 2018. While my disability pension was being assessed I was to go on Newstart benefit. This benefit was delayed because my partner earned too much income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Trying to contact Centrelink is a most frustrating process taking many disconnected phone calls many hours on call waiting for a phone call connection to speak to a customer service officer. I finally convinced Centrelink that I had no partner. This process took from the January 21 to February 20 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was notified in May 2018 to fill out forms for aged pension. I further checked by phone and by visiting the Centrelink office to see if any further documentation was required to enable a smooth transition from Newstart to the aged pension. I was assured all was in order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I attended the office of Centrelink on 4th of July 2018 to again check if all was in order for the transition from Newstart to aged pension as I have had many frustrations concerning contrary information from many Centrelink customer service officers. I again was assured that all was in process and in order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story goes on and on. It is one of frustration, lost papers and things just not working out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have more stories that I could share with the House tonight, but what I really want to come to is that this is so important because social security and welfare is the largest component of government spending. In the 2018-19 budget, it is estimated that $176 billion will be spent on social security. That is so much money. And not only is it so much money, but it impacts on almost every single one of us. Centrelink is the public face of the government, and most of us will have some relationship with Centrelink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you some feeling from my electorate. Anyone needing assistance with accommodation, renting, at risk or homelessness needs to go to Centrelinkâand there are 7,840 payments in my electorate. If you are planning your retirement and the age pension, you have to go to Centrelinkânearly 20,000 people in my electorate. If you are caring for someone with an illness or disability, you have to go to Centrelinkâ1,848 payments. If you need to access concession and healthcare cards, you've got to go to Centrelinkâ11,000 payments. If you are adopting a child, if you need assistance with child care, if you are caring for an older Australian, if you are disabled, ill, injured, looking for work, seeking employment income confirmation, a victim of family and domestic violence, trying to find the right family day care operator, a young person looking for financial and health support, a refugee or humanitarian entrant and seeking help, an Indigenous Australian looking for work, study or training, leaving school, looking for work or starting an apprenticeship, wanting to access the national redress scheme, retrenched or made redundant you have to go to Centrelink. That is a lot of people. Without doubt, it is a really important part of what the government does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, sadly, it is not working. It is not working well in my electorate, and there are many other electorates where it is not working. It is not the lack of good, talented people within Centrelink; it is a lack of resources and a lack of actual management so that we make sure we get the customer service that we really need. What I am saying tonight is that this issue is not about intent or availability; it is much more practical than that. It is an issue of managing workflow and it is an issue of resource management. The issue is that the whole agency is not able to do what it was set up to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we do? It is fine to come to this parliament and grizzle and complain and say that things don't work. So, on behalf of my community, next Monday I am going to introduce a private member's bill. I have advice from many of the welfare agencies, and I have read the McClure report and many others. I'm going to introduce the Social Security Commission Bill 2018. The objective of this bill is to establish a social security commission to provide the parliament with independent and considered advice on a fair and reasonable social safety net for those who are dependent, in whole or in part, on social security payments. The commission will ensure an acceptable standard of living for recipients of social security payments and whether the current level of payment provides adequate support to meet that standard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no belief at all that the government will support this but, in introducing this private member's bill, I am putting on notice that things aren't working well, that there is enormous dissatisfaction in the community and that these are real people, with real lives and real concerns that need to be taken seriously. I thank the people of Indi for getting in touch with my office. Continue to do so. We will continue to be your advocate. We will continue to bring your issues to the Department of Social Security and to this parliament and try to get the action we need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  Tonight I'd like to speak on the ACCC's recent electricity pricing inquiry. Specifically, I'd like to offer my support for the ACCC's recommendation No. 24, which is that the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme be abolished by 2021. The ACCC say in their report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the dramatic reduction in solar PV installation costs, the ACCC considers the case for a subsidy for small-scale solar installations is now weak, and is of the view that the SRES should be ended earlier than its currently scheduled end date in 2030. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year there are $1.2 billion of subsidies under this scheme. With the way that scheme works, that $1.2 billion actually gets added to everyone's electricity bill. When everyone gets their bill from one of the retailers, that is smeared across it. Across the chamber and across the parliament over the last two days since we've returned from the winter recess everyone has been talking about lowering electricity prices. Here is a way that we can knock at least $1 billion off. As I said, this has cost $1.2 billion. We could knock that off and bring electricity prices down if we accepted this recommendation. The only reason for not accepting it is if we were to listen to the noisy green rent-seekers who want the subsidy to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll explain how the subsidy works. Someone installing solar panels on their roof will get a $40 rebate for every estimated megawatt hour their rooftop installation will generate out to the year 2030. I have a few calculations from a group called Solar Choice. I will give an example from New South Wales. Where your solar panels are located in Australia will affect the generation you get. In New South Wales you would generate more electricity through your solar panels than you would in Victoria and in Tasmania. In New South Wales a five-kilowatt installation would cost you $8,600, but you would get a subsidy of $3,340. Many people don't even know that they are getting that subsidy, because it is written in the contract that the installer gets it. So they would pay $5,260 out of their pocket and that $3,340 would simply get added onto everyone else's electricity bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, even large industrial premises can take advantage of this scheme. Under this scheme you can install up to 100 kilowatts, which is around 400 solar panels. Even though the all-up cost you may pay out of your pocket is $113,000, the rebate you getâthe cost to everyone else who uses electricityâis $68,260. They are the estimated costs in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the Grattan Institute said about this solar scheme? In 2005 they drew attention to this scheme. I'll quote directly their report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Sundown, sunrise</span> by Tony Wood and David Blowers. They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ lavish government subsidies plus the structure of electricity network tariffs means that the cost of solar PV take-up has outweighed the benefits by almost $10 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is $10 billion wasted. They went on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By the time the subsidies finally run out, households and businesses that have not installed solar PV will have spent more than $14 billion subsidising households that have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is also simply a reverse Robin Hood scheme. Those renting and those living in apartments are subsidising those who are able to afford to install solar on their roof at the cost of a $14 billion wealth transfer. And they conclude:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia could have reduced emissions for much less money. Governments have created a policy mess that should never be repeated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And also, not only is it adding costs to electricity it is also completely economically inefficient. In fact, it is little more than a Ponzi scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at what the levelised cost of energy from a rooftop solar scheme is, we have the Australian Energy Council's <span style="font-style:italic;">Solar report</span> from January 2018. They give a levelised cost of energy for different discount rates, for different cities and for differently sized installations. I'll give the example, again in Sydney, of a five-kilowatt solar installation. They say that the cost after the subsidies is $120 a megawatt-hour. If we put the subsidy back in, we are getting a generation cost of $180 a megawatt-hour to generate that electricity. So what we're actually doing is turning down our coal generators, that have a marginal cost of around $35, and subsidising something that costs $180 a megawatt-hour. Imagine if you were running a factory which was producing goods for $35 a unit and you decided to close that factory down, and you opened another factory to produce that same good for $180. That would be clear economic insanity. But this is exactly what this scheme does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same if we look at it, again for a large industrial installationâsomething which is 100 kilowatts in Sydneyâa factory at $120 a megawatt-hour, with the subsidy already taken out. If we put that subsidy back in, again, we are north of $180 a megawatt-hour. While that may make sense for that particular building or that particular household, as the Grattan Institute points out, the only reason for that is that the cost of the transmission lines is not actually costed economically. Again, I quote from the Grattan Institute. They say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A second subsidy associated with solar PV relates to how electricity is priced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on for solar households:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since they consume less electricity overall, they pay less than other households do to use the network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ solar households on average place as much strain on the distribution network as those without solar PV do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when you put those costs in, the economic inefficiency of this scheme also calls for it to be stopped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also heard some talk that Australia has this great competitive advantage: we are the sunburnt country. But when you look at our coastal regionsâin Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and even Brisbaneâand where they're being installed, the solar PV outputs from those solar panels are no greater than many other places in the world. Here are some numbers as examples. The solar PV output from one-kilowatt solar panels in Sydney is 1,397, and in Melbourne it's 1,295. Compare that with places like Egypt that are rolling out one of the largest coal-fired power stations in the world. In Cairo, it's 1,802, and in Aswan it's 1,926. So on average, they're generating more than 29 per cent more electricity from a solar panelâ29 per cent more than in Sydney and 39 per cent more than in Melbourne. It's similar in India. In India you'd be able to generate more electricity in many major cities than you would in Australia. So we have no competitive advantage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on all members of parliament: let's work on this together. Let's not try and score points off each other about protecting renewables or something. We can save Australian consumers. We can save the worst-off consumers, those hardest up, $1.2 billion if we could get together and both adopt the ACCC recommendation, which I commend to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  This is a government that is always there for the shiny, exciting headline-grabbing announcements when it comes to digital projects but that goes missing when it comes to the implementation. After those announcements, it goes missing. We've seen that with the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the way in which it has completely mucked up the implementation. We've seen it with the census fail and we've seen it with the National Broadband Network. This is a government that cannot deliver services and cannot deliver digital projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years go, this government announced it was going to 'rescue' Labor's electronic health record system. This is, of course, after coming to government and doing nothing at all for 12 months. Suddenly it had to rescue a system that was on a trajectory of actually getting more and more people signed up. Never mind that Labor's opt-in scheme didn't need rescuing. It was a scheme that already had a million people signed up and was growing steadily as public awareness of its benefits spread. Nonetheless, they decided to go to an opt-out model. The opt-in model relied on the informed consent of patients actively choosing to take part; the opt-out model relies on presumed consent. It is a fundamental shift in thinking about the electronic health record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, the government somehow didn't go back and tighten the legislation or look at whether the enabling framework legislation that underpinned our personally controlled health record was suitable. So right from the start they dropped the ball on implementation. They did nothing for ages, they then axed the Medicare Locals that were charged with getting informed consent for the personally controlled electronic health records and then they decided that they would trial opt-out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the announcement of the trials we didn't hear much about itâalthough there were some problems with the opt-out trial sitesâuntil a few months ago when the government announced that the three-month opt-out period would start. From the beginning, we were pretty wary. We recognise that, if implemented by a competent government, e-health could deliver tangible healthcare improvements and save the health system up to $7 billion a year through fewer diagnosis, treatment and prescription errors. That's the very reason that we began delivering this important reform when we were in governmentâbuilding that architecture. But given that this is the same mob that, as I said, gave us census fail, stuffed up robo-debt, botched the NBN and the NDIS, and allowed Australians' Medicare data to be sold on the dark web, we had real concerns about their ability to pull this off, Unfortunately, our worst fears have been realised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government made the decision to transition to an opt-out system, but made no real effort to explain this fundamental change to the community and to bring the community with them. They made no effort to reassure people that their privacy would be protected and that their data would remain secure. In short, they didn't seek to bring the public along with them. If anything, they sought to conceal these changes from the Australian public. There was no public information campaignâwe were assured by the Australian Digital Health Agency that there would be. There was no TV advertising and no leadership from the Minister for Health. They gave every impression that they were trying to sneak through the opt-out process so that Australians wouldn't even notice that it was happening and so wouldn't exercise their right to opt out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was this approach that of course fuelled the firestorm of public suspicion and distrust that was to follow. The first month of the opt-out period, frankly, has been an absolute disaster. The media, doctors, unions, privacy advocates and opposition have all exposed a string of privacy and security concerns that the government seemed not to have even considered, nor could it actually explain them. Two weeks into the fiasco, the minister announced some welcome changes: amendments to require law enforcement agencies to get a warrant or a court order to access records, an extension to the opt-out period and the ability to delete permanently unwanted records. The minister also finally conceded the need for a comprehensive public information campaign. We're still waiting on the details of what this will look like and whether it will be adequate. We're also deeply sceptical that any truly comprehensive campaign can be produced and rolled out in the three months between now and the end of the extended opt-out period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But whatever the case, these changes do not go far enough to address the concerns swirling around the Australian community. That's why Labor has maintained its call for the rollout of the scheme to be suspended until these issues can be addressed. And that's why Labor has today called for a comprehensive Senate inquiry into the scheme, not just into the government's proposed legislative amendments but into the whole system underpinning the My Health Record system. We want this inquiry to look at all of the legislation, regulations and rules that underpin the schemeâa complete stocktake of the My Health Record system. There are some serious unaddressed issues involving domestic violence and workers compensation, and the potential that commercial actors like health insurers will get access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family law experts have warned that the system could become a new battleground in disputes between warring exes and risk the safety of women fleeing abusive former partners. They point to a loophole that allows a parent who does not have primary custody to create a My Health Record on their child's behalf without the knowledge or consent of the former partner. An abusive ex-partner could then gain access to details, including the location of medical practitioners and pharmacies attended by the child with their primary caregiver, putting people at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also uncertainty about the potential for employers to gain access to the private health data of workers. Unions are urging tens of thousands of their members to opt out, because they fear that under the new system employer doctors used for pre-employment health checks for insurance purposes could get access to and pass on a worker's entire medical history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants this reform to succeed, but we can well understand why unions are urging their members to opt out. With this kind of uncertainty swirling around, why wouldn't they? This is what the government has done. There was a 10-year pathway to an excellent healthcare reform, and because of the government's failure to address some of these fundamental questions we've got unions telling people to opt out, doctors telling people to opt out, GPs saying they have opted out and specialists saying the same thing. Even politicians: there are many members of this place who have told me that they have opted out. This is not the sort of system that gives us and the public a great deal of confidence that the government has got it right. The government claims none of these are actually issuesâforgive my scepticism. It also said there was no issue around law enforcement access but was then forced into a humiliating backdown when it agreed to amend the legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a proper look at these issues. Let's consider some other proposals, too. Should there be a second factor for authentication beyond username and password for healthcare professionals? Should there be better default access restrictions so that healthcare professionals other than your immediate treating doctor don't see things like your STI history, for example? Should we make it opt in for your data to be used for research purposes or opt in for each individual piece of health data to be uploaded? Should we revoke third-party apps' access to the data?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're deeply concerned also about the secondary use of data. Under the current framework, My Health Record data cannot be used for solely commercial and non-health related purposes such as direct marketing to consumers. But what's to stop a future government, particularly one that has control of the Senate, changing that framework to give insurance companies, for example, access to that data? We know the big health insurers want access. They're very keen for that. Labor wants to make sure that that does not happenâno matter whatâbut we don't trust this government to honour its assurances. We want an ironclad legislated guarantee that this won't happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given all of this continued uncertainty, we urge the Greens and crossbenchers to join with us in the Senate to make this inquiry a reality. We know that the legislation the government is proposing will go to a Senate inquiry. We understand that is going to be the case, and it is certainly what we would be recommending, but it needs a much broader inquiry where people who have expertise in cybersecurity and in privacy law can actually have these matters heard. Nothing less than a comprehensive inquiry will satisfy concerned stakeholders and a concerned public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a system that is an important health reform, but the government has absolutely jeopardised the reform because of its failure to get the implementation right. It has underestimated people's concerns about their privacy and people's concern and understanding of what is now happening with their data. We are in a different world from what we were in back 2012 when we had an opt-in, informed-consent system. The government has failed with My Health Record. We need to look at this further.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E5D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  This is my first grievance debate. When I heard about a grievance debate, I thought: I don't need 10 minutes; I probably need half a day. Anyway, let's give it a run in the park! Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, I would like to bring to your attention some of the things that we're doing in New Englandâand the grievance, of course, is how little happened before the coalition government got in. When I first arrived, there was a thing called the Legume-Woodenbong Road. It is a road that goes from my electorate to your electorate. It is vitally important that we keep that road safe. I had a meeting at Woodenbong the other dayâWoodenbong is in your electorateâand I didn't tell you because I didn't think I had to. I really enjoyed it. They were really friendly to me. They said it was great to see meâand I put in an apology for you! It is so important that we get the Legume-Woodenbong Road up and running. It is safe for the kids. It moves about 430,000 head of stock along it. It is great for the economy of Casino. It is great for the economy of the tablelands. I went there with Mayor Peter Petty from Tenterfield. He is such a good fella. You can put him in the car and listen to him and it's an absolute joy. He is the only person I know who, when you talk to him, gives you your full name. He says: 'I'll tell you what, young Kevin Hogan'âit is an absolute joy. We are spending about $11.8 million on getting Mount Lindesay Road and the Legume-Woodenbong Road up and running. I would also like to commend Thomas George, the member for Lismore, who has done so much to work with us in that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tenterfield bypass is another big issue. We've got money on the table for Tenterfield bypass and we are getting that done. We are making sure the New England Highway is a corridor of commerce. And just below the Tenterfield bypass we have the Bolivia Hill realignment. The deck of that bridge is going to be only slightly lower than the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This is great. They have a work camp out on Pye Road, and we have completely booked out the town of Tenterfield. We have got people in there. It is important, during the drought, that we get these infrastructure projects happening and get the town moving. There is not much money coming in from the cockies because things are a bit tough. But, by gosh, we have got some money coming in from some of the work we are doing on infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to also note Michael Hartmannâa good fella and a good mate. Unfortunately, Michael Hartmann died of a brain tumour. I used to drive around with Michael Hartmann, and I asked him, 'What can we do for Guyra?' And he brought one thing to my attentionâthe Kolora aged-care facility, which is used for dementia care. He said, 'If you've got a little bit of money in the whippy tin, you should try and help them out'âand we did that. It was great to get that opened the other day; it was really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All around the electorate, we have upgraded 24 bridges. This has been part and parcel of making sure we can get those B-doublesâthose trucks and all that transportâto markets and also create greater safety. That is really important. For so long, these bridges stayed in a sort of a twilight zone. To see new concrete bridges that can take a B-double means so much to people in the local areaâand obviously it means a fair bit to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Armidaleâwho can forget! By gosh, didn't we have a fight for the APVMA! There were so many people arguing against us about the movement of the APVMA and real decentralisation. And now the people of the city of Armidale are saying there is a real buzz in the town. It is actually happening. They are seeing people move in. We are getting new scientists moving in. Of course, as the regulator moves into the town, the chemical companies will want to be there as well because they'll want to be near the regulator. So that is basically a centre of excellence there. And that, I think, could be a template for decentralisation in so many areasâand it is something we have got to do. It is no good for Sydney and Melbourne to complain about housing prices if they don't want to participate in a program of decentralisation. People are not going to leave Sydney unless you give them a reason to. In the regional areas, we'll give people a reason to do that. It is part and parcel of what the National Party stands for and, I imagine, what the Liberal Party stands for. And the Labor Party? We'll hear from them in a little while. We upgraded the Armidale airportâthat was very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="E5D" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr JOYCE:</span>
                  </a>  No, I'm not. You just replied to me, so I can't be. You just heard me. We upgraded the Armidale airport. It was very important to get access to a new industrial area we are building there. In Tamworth, when we first arrived, we expanded Chaffey Dam. We took it from 60,000 megs to around about 103,000 megs. If we hadn't done that, Tamworth would have run out of water during the drought. We had to fight the green movement all the way. They were worried about the Booroolong frog. I thought a dam with more water would be absolutely great for more frogs, but we had to fight that. We got it through, and that's why the city of Tamworth now has water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also upgraded the instrument landing system at Tamworth airport. What's the importance of that? It's because we're fighting as hard as we can to get the new training school for Qantas into Tamworth. That's 300 jobs, if we get that in there. We're working very closely with the council. I want to commend Col Murray and also the local state member, Kevin Anderson, for trying to make sure that we get those jobs into Tamworth. We're working on that all the time. We're building the ring-road around Tamworth, and the upgrade of Appleby Lane was vitally important for that. Also the busiest bridge in northern New South Wales is Jewry Street Bridge, and we're upgrading that as well. It's very important. We're still trying to get Dungowan Dam upgraded. This would, basically, plumb up Tamworth for further growth into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Northern Inland Centre of Sporting Excellence, which is vitally important. As you go into Tamworth we'll have a multimillion-dollar sport facility that sits right beside AELEC, which is the big horse facility that's so good for cutting horses for rodeos. Rodeos are big in our area. We love our rodeos. This sporting facility means the kids will be there, the netballers will be there, the athletics tracks will be there and the equestrian area will be there. They'll all be working and showing people that Tamworth is a great city to live in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In QuirindiâI love water infrastructureâwe upgraded the connection between Quipolly Dam and Werris Creek. Not much happened in Werris Creek for a long while. It's strange that, because the previous local member came from Werris Creek. I used to live in Werris Creek. I bought a house for $73,000 and rode that bull market in real estate until I sold it years later for $69,000. I was always very aware of how far that town had been left behind, so to upgrade that water supply into Werris Creek gives it the potential for commercial growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're spending over $130 million on the Scone bypass to make sure that when you're driving from Brisbane down to Sydney along that New England Highway you do it in a quicker form. That's a vitally important piece of infrastructure that's happening right now at Scone. We're also upgrading the Scone saleyards, just as we're upgrading the Inverell saleyards. We put money on the table for Middlebrook Bridge, and we also have put planning in place for the upgrade of the airport. There's also the equine centre there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these are part and parcel of what you do, because your primary responsibility here, always, is to look after your local seat, and to try and be a champion of your local seat. I say this because sometimes you have to remind people that you're hard at work for them. In the background we are fighting now to make sure we get cheaper power prices. The pensioners and the people doing it tough want cheaper power prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a more sombre note, to hear from the Salvation Army that people in my electorate are going to bed at half past five in the evenings when it's cold because they can't afford their power bills is a total and utter disgrace. I'll be making sure that I do whatever I have to do to make sure we get them cheaper power bills; otherwise, we are not doing our jobs as local members. You've got to look after the most vulnerable, and, by gosh, they are the most vulnerable. It was great to have discussions with the Prime Minister today about precisely how we do this, and to work with our colleagues to make sure that we do this. We are fighting for lower power prices, and we've got to secure lower power prices if we take the dignity of people, especially those doing it tough, seriously. Stock sales over in the memberâwhat's your seat?</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  Not in the member for Swan's seat, but over in the west, we've got to keep that live sheep trade going. You've got to keep it going. We're actually making a buck for these people, especially for the people out in the remote towns of Western Australia. We've got to keep that live sheep trade going, because, if we don't, we're going to be taking money out of the towns. It's so important to underpin that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final issue, before I conclude, is drought. Drought is an issue that is so iconic. It's not just iconic for the people who are suffering drought, but it shows whether this parliament cares for those who are doing it tough. I also commend that the Labor Party is walking up to the mark on this. I heard the Leader of the Opposition's speech in the chamber the other day and I commend him for that. I don't want this to be a partisan fight on drought. I want it to be a bipartisan approach.</span>
