                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:01</span>):  by leave—In November last year the government established an independent review of Australia's aviation safety regulatory system to ensure that it is well positioned to meet Australia's future aviation demands. The review was conducted by an independent panel headed by Mr David Forsyth AM, a respected figure in Australian aviation through his previous senior managerial roles in Qantas and as Chair of Airservices Australia. Mr Forsyth was joined on the panel by two eminent overseas aviation safety experts—Mr Don Spruston from Canada and Mr Roger Whitefield from the United Kingdom. On 3 June 2014, I tabled the panel's <span style="font-style:italic;">Aviation safety regulation review </span>report in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since tabling the report, the government has given careful consideration to the 37 recommendations and other matters raised in the report. This consideration has been informed by close consultation with our aviation agencies and by 69 industry and public comments on the report.  I am pleased today to be able to table the government's response to the report. The report confirms that Australia has an advanced aviation regulatory system in place and one of the safest regular public transport systems in the world. Australia also has sound safety governance arrangements which ensure that the regulatory, investigative and service provision roles of our key aviation agencies are properly separated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, given the speed with which the global and domestic aviation industry is changing, we need to look for continuous improvement in our aviation safety regulatory system. We need to update our system to reflect the growing diversity of our aviation industry. The report has identified areas where our present arrangements, structures and relationships can be improved to ensure that Australia remains a leading aviation state. The report made 37 recommendations, many relating to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, but others have implications for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Airservices Australia, my department and the Department of Defence. The government has fully agreed to or agreed to undertake a more detailed examination of 36 of the 37 recommendations. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In responding to the report the government has endorsed a number of key principles that should continue to underpin our future aviation safety system:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Bullet">recognition that Australia's safety regulatory system plays an important role in ensuring that Australia has a safe, efficient and competitive aviation industry;</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These principles and the actions which flow from them will be contained in an enhanced state safety program, an SSP. The SSP will outline short, medium and long term objectives for our aviation system including planned major regulatory, infrastructure and service changes. In addition, the respective policy, regulatory, investigative and service provision roles and coordination between government aviation agencies will continue to be clearly set out in the SSP and how they should work cooperatively on major initiatives. The government recognises that our agencies and industry are already operating to some extent in accordance with these principles but believes it is important that they be set out to help guide the future direction of our aviation safety system.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">CASA is a critical element in our aviation safety system. CASA is first and foremost the regulator for civil aviation with the increasingly challenging task of implementing and oversighting a range of aviation regulatory arrangements. Additionally CASA plays a key role in developing new regulations and amending existing regulations to take account of industry changes, emerging safety issues and meeting international standards and practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In establishing this review the government was conscious of complaints that it had received from industry about CASA's regulatory approach and the perceived insufficient regard to the impacts of regulatory actions or proposed new or amended regulations on industry operations. Problems with the implementation of new regulatory standards have also been raised by industry as an issue. The review panel has clearly received submissions that have raised similar concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of the regulator is a difficult one. CASA serves not only the industry but the public more broadly. CASA is part of a system which is charged with protecting all passengers, their crew and the community. Members of the travelling public are not usually able to make their own individual assessments of all the safety issues and rely on the regulatory system for assurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aviation services can be complex and expensive operations. The business environment in which aviation operates is a challenging and often highly competitive one with fluctuating market conditions. Even well-established and well-intentioned aviation operators can encounter problems. In such a complex environment the government expects the regulator to be firm but fair in how it conducts its role. The regulator also needs to be well-informed about the industry context, conscious of the impacts that its actions have on operators and open to approaches which achieve safety outcomes without unnecessary impacts on industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This approach calls for effective and ongoing engagement and communication with the industry, both at a strategic and working level. As the Aviation Safety Regulation Review recommends, we need to create an 'effective collaborative relationship [between CASA and the industry based] on a foundation of mutual understanding and respect'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a key part of our aviation safety system, the government expects the CASA board to take an active role in setting directions for CASA and overseeing its functions. Critically the government also expects the board to maintain an effective dialogue with industry at a strategic level. The government has already moved to enhance the aviation skills and experience on the board, with amendments passed earlier this year to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to expand the board to seven members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has appointed Mr Jeff Boyd as Deputy Chairman of the board, who brings valuable experience in working with different parts of the diverse Australian aviation industry. Today I am pleased to announce the appointment of three more members to the CASA board to fill the current vacancies. The new members are: Anita Taylor, a chartered accountant, experienced company director and a long-term member of the sport-aviation industry who has been gliding since she was 16; Captain Murray Warfield, a former Qantas general manager of regulatory and industry affairs; and, finally, Mr Ian Smith, who has had a long and distinguished career in the aviation insurance industry and earlier this year was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his work in the promotion and development of aviation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also welcomes the appointment of Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Mark Skidmore AM to the position of the Director of Aviation Safety. This appointment will bring a further wealth of aviation experience to the board. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also be issuing a new Statement of Expectations (SOE) to the revamped board to give effect to the recommendations in the report. The board will appropriately have the opportunity to set out in an implementation plan their response to the new SOE. The government looks forward to working with the new board and director in the delivery of all of these recommendations. Consistent with the government's broader agenda in deregulation, the government also expects CASA to continue to look for ways to reduce regulatory costs on the industry without compromising safety.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government fully supports the vital role of the ATSB. Independent investigation of accidents or incidents remains a crucial element of the safety system, helping us understand the causes and hence the sources of risks to safety. This helps to avoid future accidents. If the system is to work well, industry must cooperate in providing information during accident and incident investigations and in reporting incidents generally. The government will take a number of actions to give effect to this commitment including:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Bullet">the appointment of an additional ATSB commissioner with aviation experience; and</span>

                <span class="HPS-Bullet">issuing a new Statement of Expectations to the ATSB once the commission and the government has had an opportunity to review the findings of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board review of the ATSB, which was publicly released in Canada yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the Canadian Transportation Safety Board released its independent report into the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The ATSB tasked the Canadian TSB to undertake an independent review of their investigation methodologies and processes; how they are applied in specific cases and how this compared to international best practice standards. The TSB review looked in detail at three separate investigations, one of which was the Pel-Air inquiry—which, as members may recall, was the subject of a report by the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Canadian TSB found that ATSB investigation methodology and analysis tools represent best practice and have been shown to produce very good results, they found in the case of the Pel-Air investigation there were errors made. I am concerned that the TSB report raises some concerns about the application of ATSB methodologies in the investigation of the ditching of the Pel-Air aircraft off Norfolk Island in 2009. As a consequence I have asked the ATSB Commission to give serious consideration to re-opening the investigation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related point, I have just announced that I will shortly be appointing a new commissioner for the ATSB with a specific background in aviation. This will fulfil an undertaking made by the coalition prior to the election and also one of the recommendations of the report. I have asked that a fresh review of the Pel-Air accident take into account the findings of the ATSB report.</span>

I have no doubt that the government and opposition will be able to work constructively to develop a better atmosphere within the sector. But we certainly also need the industry to be willing to do what it can to make the aviation system work and work well.

The government's response is clearly to set out aviation safety policies, principles and priorities to our agencies, and to the industry and the community to help with this process.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:20</span>):  Can I begin by saying that it is good to see the Deputy Prime Minister back in the chamber. Everyone in the House wishes him well on the personal level, if not the political!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always said that aviation safety is an issue that is well above politics. I am pleased to say that for the many years that I have been first a shadow minister, then a minister, then back again as a shadow minister, the current minister for transport has had the same view. I respect that. That is as it should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is any area that is above politics it has to be this one, because the whole of the parliament has an interest in working towards ensuring that aviation safety remains an issue of which Australia can be rightly proud. Road accidents, of course, cause much more trauma to Australians, and there would not be a single member of the public who has not been touched by an incident on our roads. Fortunately, in this House I can say that Australia's record on aviation safety is the envy of the world; we need to make sure that that continues to be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As elected representative we need to make sure that we have a considered and very precautionary approach to aviation safety. We cannot take it for granted, because if there ever were to be an incident, particularly an RPT incident, the consequences for the travelling public would be severe. But the consequences for the national economy would also be catastrophic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety of travellers must be put above everything. When the minister announced the Aviation Safety Regulation Review conducted by David Forsyth, as well as Don Spruston from Canada and Roger Whitefield of the UK, the opposition welcomed it. We remain proud of our own record in government when it comes to aviation safety, but you can never be too careful. We must always be prepared to look, look and look again to ensure that our safety arrangements respond to changing circumstances. Indeed, I believe that an incoming minister responsible for aviation has a duty to satisfy himself or herself that existing safety arrangements are adequate. And that is why—even though the minister was returning to the portfolio, rather than being new to this issue—I believe it was appropriate for the minister to convene this review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review was finalised in May and it included 37 recommendations. Today's statement by the minister seems to indicate that our system was in good shape, but I welcome the government's announcements today that it will appoint three new members to the CASA board, and that it will issue Statements of Expectations to CASA and to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. I wish the best of luck to the new CASA board members, Anita Taylor, Murray Warfield, and Ian Smith, just as I welcome the appointment of former Air Vice Marshal Mark Skidmore to the position of Director of Aviation Safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to John McCormick. John McCormick did an outstanding job. He was someone who was recruited after an international search for the best person. He brought decades of experience, not just in the Australian aviation industry but also particularly in Hong Kong, for Cathay Pacific, and in the international sector. I think he provided a rigour that was needed at the time. When John McCormick made the decision to ground Tiger Airways, that decision to ground an RPT service for the first—and hopefully the last—time in Australia's history was not only a courageous step but one that was entirely appropriate and needed. When Mr McCormick had advised me of the decision, I remember speaking to Prime Minister Gillard and informing her of what was about to occur—because, by definition, you cannot make a decision that an airline is unsafe and then say, 'we will ground them in a couple of days' time'. What it meant by definition was that people got stranded. There was a real-world impact on the travelling public, particularly given the nature of Tiger; and on many families who were able to travel by air for the first time, because it was a budget airline. That was a courageous decision by John McCormick. The fact that Tiger has now been taken over by Virgin Australia and is now functioning in a way that satisfies all the safety concerns shows that that was not just a courageous decision but a correct decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the report, the review panel expressed concern about relations between the industry and the regulator. It said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In recent years, the regulator has adopted an across the board hard-line philosophy, which in the Panel's view, is not appropriate for an advanced aviation nation such as Australia. As a result, relationships between industry and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) have, in many cases, become adversarial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It went on to recommend a new strategic direction for CASA, calling for a more '<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    color:#221E1F;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">collaborative relationship on a foundation of mutual trust and respect</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    color:#221E1F;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    color:#221E1F;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">. </span>It is here that I would respectfully sound a note of caution to the minister. I certainly agree that it is important for a regulated industry, like aviation, to have constructive and respectful relations between the regulator and the industry; but I would be very concerned if the relationship between CASA and aviation operators became too close. I expressed this concern to David Forsyth, who the minister ensured—and I thank him for this—gave me a verbal review as well, and we were able to have a very constructive discussion about it. If I could, I would like to express some caution. I think that, by definition, a regulator must have a bit of tension with those people who it is regulating, particularly in aviation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The term 'trainspotters' is pretty familiar to people; in aviation there are 'plane spotters'. They think that they know best, and they do not want to be told by any regulator that they do not know how to keep their plane safe. But the truth is that the incidents that have occurred in this country have occurred particularly with small planes, which are involved in incidents all too regularly. I think one of the worst parts of the job of being the aviation minister in this country is the fact that you get notified in real time. Except for the minister, people are probably unaware of that. I have had phone calls at all hours telling me that a plane with two or three people on board has gone missing. When the departmental head rang, or in the case of Mr McCormick there was often direct contact, you really did not want to receive that call.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I could sound that cautious note, as I expressed to David Forsyth: the customers are not the people who own the planes; the customers of CASA and aviation safety are the people on the planes and the people who would be impacted if there were an incident. Planes fly over my house at far too regular intervals. My electorate is the second smallest geographically; Wentworth is the smallest. These areas have highly dense populations. If there were an incident in these most densely populated areas of Australia, it would have an impact not just on people on the planes but on people in the vicinity of an airport. If I could express that concern—that we must never sacrifice rigour for harmony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the minister that the actions of the regulator must be firm, and they must also be fair. But the minister has a responsibility to hold the line against industry pressure. We must maintain the necessary tension between the regulator and the regulated to keep all parties on their toes. If they are on their toes then they are focused on what matters: the safety of the travelling public. If they were allowed to operate too closely and without appropriate distance, the public would be the loser. So, while doing all we can to promote professional dealings among all participants in the industry, our overriding responsibility is to make accident prevention and proper safety standards our primary concern. All other concerns must be further down the ladder. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the minister's comment that he is considering asking the ATSB to reopen the investigation into the Pel-Air incident of 2009. This follows the findings this week of the delayed report of the inquiry that I commissioned as the minister, which was conducted by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board. I note that the TSB found that the ATSB investigation methods were best practice, but I certainly welcome, as I previously said, the principle that, if there is any doubt at all, there is a need to take that precautionary principle into consideration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that the government has required aviation operators to cut about $12 million from their costs as part of its push to reduce so-called red tape. I also note that the government has made a similar demand of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. You cannot have organisations like CASA and AMSA, which perform such an extraordinarily important role in this country, and continue to put pressure on them to cut costs. AMSA has a critical role to play, as we have seen with the issue of the Malaysia Airlines search and rescue. AMSA looks after about one-third of the world's surface, so it is an absolutely critical agency. I do believe that there is a real case for quarantining it from cuts for aviation safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude by indicating publicly, as I have privately to the minister, that the opposition is firmly committed to working in a constructive and bipartisan way on these issues. I note that the minister has been exemplary in ensuring appropriate briefings and in ensuring that this issue continues to be where it was when I was the minister and, previously, under the Howard government. It is absolutely critical that we deal with this. Given the short period that the opposition has had the government's response to the report, it is not for me today to comment specifically on the government's response to each of the 37 recommendations. I indicate to the minister that, should there be any concerns, I will express them to him directly, because we have just received the response to the report. I note that the government has accepted in whole or in part all of the recommendations, with one exception, but we reserve our right to comment further on those matters, based upon a proper, closer analysis and proper advice. I indicate that that should not be seen in any way as a suggestion that we will operate politically on this issue, because we will not. We will deal with these things on their merits. I thank the minister for his response and conclude where I began: it is good to see him back in the House.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's success in the offshore petroleum investment market is underpinned by its comprehensive and well-established regulatory framework. Central to this framework is the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), a national regulator with the experience and technical capacity to effectively regulate in relation to matters of occupational health and safety, structural integrity, and environmental management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2014, the Commonwealth government announced a new streamlined approach for environmental approvals for offshore petroleum activities. The approach makes NOPSEMA the sole environmental regulator for these activities in Commonwealth waters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Streamlining has significantly increased regulatory efficiency in respect of petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters, as well as delivering clarity and certainty for industry participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising these significant gains, the Commonwealth government is seeking to streamline regulatory arrangements in respect of all offshore petroleum activities. As part of this process, the states and the Northern Territory are being encouraged to confer occupational health and safety, structural integrity and environmental management functions and powers upon NOPSEMA under their respective legislation in respect of those waters of the sea within their jurisdictional reach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This would permit the states and the Northern Territory to benefit from the expertise and experience of an established national regulator, and increase the efficiency of the administrative process by minimising the number of regulatory agencies with whom industry participants must deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act in its present iteration includes a number of legislative impediments to conferral. For example, there is a requirement to conclude an intergovernmental agreement before conferral is permitted in respect of certain areas of the sea. In relation to others, conferral is not permitted at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill seek to remove these impediments, thereby permitting conferral across as wide a geographic area as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This represents an important step towards the establishment of a single national regulator for all safety, structural integrity and environmental management matters in the offshore petroleum sector. Moreover, it underscores this government's ongoing commitment to the maintenance and improvement of a strong and effective regulatory framework, and to a cooperative approach to the regulation of offshore petroleum activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill further makes a number of technical amendments to the administrative framework relating to the taking of particular voluntary actions under the Act and regulations by multiple registered holders of a single petroleum title.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the high cost of offshore petroleum operations, petroleum titles are often held by a consortium of companies. The act at present provides a mandatory process by which titleholders may take an action, such as submission of an application or nomination, that is permitted, but not required, to be taken under the act or regulations, where there is more than one registered holder of the relevant title. Such an action is defined under the act as an 'eligible voluntary action'. The process requires the holders of the title to nominate one of them to take eligible voluntary actions on behalf of the group, and only the nominated person can take an eligible voluntary action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, application of the process in practice has created some confusion among titleholders, particularly in relation to the mandatory nature of the process, and also identified several unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill seek to clarify the operation of the process relating to the taking of eligible voluntary actions and, importantly, provide an alternative process for the taking of eligible voluntary actions that titleholders may elect to use instead of the current nomination process. The alternative process would require all of the registered holders of the title to take the action jointly, such as by all signing the relevant application or nomination. The current nomination process will also still be available for use where a group of titleholders prefer this option. I commend this bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to take the opportunity to foreshadow another significant amendment to the act. As all present are no doubt aware, Australia's exploration and mining success is underpinned by its highly prospective geology, up-to-date geoscience data and comprehensive information systems. The custodian of Australia's geographic and geological data is the national geoscience agency, Geoscience Australia. As part of its core functions, Geoscience Australia has an ongoing responsibility to define the limits of Australia's maritime jurisdiction. Most recently, this work has resulted in a change to the boundary separating Commonwealth waters from the coastal waters of Western Australia. These changes, centred on the North Scott and Seringapatam Reefs, took effect from May this year. The revised boundaries around these reefs intersect three existing Commonwealth titles: one retention lease operated by Woodside Petroleum on behalf of the Browse joint venture, and two exploration permits operated by ConocoPhillips on behalf of the Poseidon joint venture. The maritime boundary changes mean that certain blocks previously falling within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth now fall within that of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our department is working closely with the Western Australian government to ensure the stable progression of the Browse and Poseidon joint ventures and to ensure the seamless and efficient transition of affected blocks from Commonwealth to Western Australian waters. This work has uncovered a gap within the Commonwealth offshore petroleum regime administered under the OPGGS Act. The gap will be of particular concern should a change to maritime boundaries in future cause an area presently within the jurisdiction of a state or the Northern Territory to fall within Commonwealth waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, there is no legislative mechanism enabling titles over affected blocks to transfer, with continuity of tenure, from the jurisdiction of the states or the Northern Territory to that of the Commonwealth following a boundary change. Instead, affected blocks become vacant acreage in Commonwealth waters and existing titleholders will lose title over those blocks. These titleholders may have already spent considerable sums of money and effort undertaking exploration activities under their title, and therefore titleholders should have continuity of tenure in the event of a boundary change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this will not impact current efforts in Western Australia, it is necessary to amend the act to anticipate those circumstances in which a future boundary change results in a gain of Commonwealth jurisdiction over the blocks. Given the ongoing nature of Geoscience Australia's effort to define Australia's maritime border, changes of this type are a realistic prospect. The proposed amendment will provide for the automatic grant of a Commonwealth title over affected blocks to the existing holders of a state or Northern Territory title at the time at which the state or Northern Territory title ceases to be in force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment is generic in nature and it is intended that it will provide a workable model for other jurisdictions to adopt. This will allow for consistency across Australia's offshore petroleum legislative framework, eliminate the sovereign risk created by future boundary changes, and ensure continuity of tenure for existing titleholders. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the levies act, 'designated coastal waters' is defined to have the same meaning as within the OPGGS Act. Expanding the geographic coverage of the designated coastal waters under the OPGGS Act would therefore consequently extend the area in respect of which levies are potentially imposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legal advice obtained by our department indicated that this consequential expansion of the application of the levies act will create a medium to high level of risk of constitutional invalidity, as it would potentially result in the imposition of a tax that discriminates between states or parts of states on the basis of geographic location. This bill therefore amends the levies act to limit the operation of the levy regime to the area constituted by the existing definition of designated coastal waters. In other words, the levies act will continue to apply in the same area that it currently does, and not to the expanded area of designated coastal waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of these amendments will be that NOPSEMA will not recover costs associated with regulatory functions performed in waters that do not fall within the existing definition of 'designated coastal waters' by way of levies imposed under the levies act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, given the lack of current activity in these waters, this is unlikely to have a significant impact in the near future. The Commonwealth will bring forward alternative options to ensure that NOPSEMA will be able to fully recover costs associated with the performance of regulatory functions conferred by a state or the Northern Territory.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The relevance of accreditation is that the government is allocating $7.5 million for schools to purchase online safety programs—and this funding can be spent on any program accredited by the Children's e-Safety Commissioner.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is important to understand that this represents the commissioner taking responsibility for the administration of this existing and longstanding scheme. This bill does not make any changes to the Online Content Scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The logic for giving the commissioner responsibility for both the existing Online Content Scheme, and the new complaints system for harmful cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child, is that there are likely to be operational efficiencies and synergies in doing so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill sets out a two-tiered scheme for the rapid removal from large social media services of cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child. Social media services participating under tier 1 will do so on a cooperative basis—that is, the service will apply to participate and if its application is accepted it will be included within tier 1. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following investigation of a complaint, the commissioner may request that the tier 1 social media service remove the cyber-bullying material, but there is no legal obligation on the social media service to comply. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner will have the power to revoke tier 1 status if the social media service repeatedly fails to remove cyber-bullying material following requests from the commissioner over a period of 12 months, and may make a recommendation to the minister that the service be declared a tier 2 social media service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A service may also be declared tier 2 at its own request. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those declared to be tier 2 social media services will be subject to legally binding notices or face the risk of civil penalties for non-compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The two-tier scheme in the bill allows for a light touch regulatory scheme in circumstances where the social media service has an effective complaints system and it is working well; but it enables the government to require that cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child be removed in circumstances where the social media service does not have an effective and well resourced complaints system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another is the experience of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre based at the University of New South Wales.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An end-user notice may require the recipient of the notice to take all reasonable steps to remove the material, refrain from posting further material targeted at the child or apologise for posting the material. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next steps available to the commissioner, if the recipient of the notice fails to respond, will include going to court to seek an injunction, or referring the matter to police.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will not include a power for the commissioner to fine end-users who fail to respond to a notice (many of whom could be children), because the government is wary of imposing fines on children in this area. </span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition of 'cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child' in clause 5 of the bill has been developed after careful consideration of a number of sources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These have included provisions in other Australian legislation, for example in relation to workplace bullying; the New Zealand Harmful Digital Communications Bill which refers to 'serious emotional distress'; academic research on the normative definitions of cyber-bullying; the terms of use of a number of the large social media services; and the cyber-bullying policies of state government agencies such as the New South Wales Department of Education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an important balance to be struck here. On the one hand we seek to capture the full breadth of cyber-bullying material. On the other hand we do not want a regulatory scheme which is excessive or heavy handed and which regulates material that does not need to be regulated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Striking this balance is particularly important given the power conferred on the commissioner by the bill—to have material removed at very short notice if the commissioner concludes that it is cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, it is important that we do not set the bar too low—but equally it is important that we do not set the bar too high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three key features will affect how the definition is applied. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, material must be likely to have the effect of seriously threatening, intimidating, harassing or humiliating a particular Australian child. The use of the word 'seriously' in the bill is intended to guide the commissioner, and the courts, so that material which is merely minor, trivial or frivolous in nature is not regarded as cyber-bullying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the definition includes the capacity for the legislative rules to include other conditions if it becomes apparent during the course of administering the legislation that further conditions are necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the definition will be applied in the commissioner's exercise of discretionary powers to issue notices. In the exercise of these powers, it is expected that the commissioner will exercise judgement and common sense, and will act consistently with best practice guidelines and statements issued by the commissioner. The legislation gives the commissioner the power to develop and issue such guidelines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is conscious that when children—particularly teenagers—communicate online, they may use swear words, or describe a person in terms that appear derogatory, but it may well be that this is simply the normal interaction between friends and acquaintances. Any parent of teenagers will understand this point immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately it will be a judgement for the commissioner, and there will be many indicators of seriousness in the broader context of the events occurring that may assist the commissioner to apply the definition, such as the intensity of the language used, the material being posted repeatedly and whether or not the recipient or target of the material is on friendly terms with the person posting the material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the purposes of the bill, a social media service is an electronic service that satisfies the following conditions:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the purposes of this definition, online social interaction includes the sharing of photos, videos or other material for social purposes. Social interaction does not include business interactions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition of social media service allows legislative rules to include or exempt specified services. The constant innovation in social media services makes these powers necessary to deal with new kinds of services which may emerge in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner's formal legal powers to issue a social media service notice will apply only to a 'large social media service'—or another service that has voluntarily consented to be subject to the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The powers will not apply to small offshore-based social media services. That is because seeking to make such services subject to Australian legal jurisdiction is unlikely to succeed if those services have no nexus with Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the commissioner will be expected to make (and maintain) contact with new and emerging social media services accessible to Australian children, wherever they are based around the world, to let them know that if they became large, they will become subject to the Australian legislation, and to seek to establish a relationship under which informal requests to remove cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child can be made.</span>

The remediation project will involve the construction of a containment cell on section 34, which will then be used to store approximately 28,500 cubic metres of contaminated material, including asbestos from all three sites. Non-contaminated material will be recycled, as appropriate, at existing facilities in the Northern Territory. The project will address the risk of contamination to local bore water, which supplies the local population at Wagait with drinking water. Once concluded, the project will enable the land to be transferred to the traditional owners, as part of the long running Kenbi land claim, lodged in 1979.</span>

Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence in March 2015 and to be concluded by 2018. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' 17th report of the 44th Parliament, the committee's last report for 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report provides the committee's view on the compatibility with human rights as defined in the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 of bills introduced during the period 24 to 27 November 2014 and legislative instruments received during the period 24 to 30 October 2014. The committee has also considered responses to the committee's comments in previous reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 17 bills introduced in the period covered by the report, eight are assessed as not raising significant human rights concerns. The committee has deferred its consideration of the remaining bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of the bills considered have been scheduled for debate during this sitting week, including: the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Bill 2014; the ACT Government Loan Bill 2014; and the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, the report outlines the committee's examination of the compatibility of these bills with our human rights obligations. I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this report, in addition to the usual analysis of bills and instruments, the committee has published two revised guidance notes. Having been in operation for over two years, it is timely for the committee to reflect on its practices and how it communicates its approach and expectations to legislation proponents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first, which replaces practice note No. 1, sets out the committee's general approach to its scrutiny task and its expectations regarding the information provided in statements of compatibility. Importantly, the committee confirms that its reports seek to largely focus on significant human rights issues and not on matters of marginal or academic interest alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second guidance note, which replaces interim practice note No. 2, provides guidance to legislation proponents on the human rights assessment of offence provisions, and particularly the characterisation of offence provisions and civil penalty provisions for human rights purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My expectation is that these guidance notes will provide useful instructions to departments and legislation proponents on the committee's approach to the interpretation and application of international human rights law. The committee has sought to harmonise its guidance with the approach and guidance of the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department. The committee is grateful for the productive engagement of the officers who have assisted in these efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this is the committee's last report for the year, I provide the following brief snapshot of the committee's work in 2014. The committee has considered 250 bills and 1,717 instruments. Of those, 213 bills—out of 250 bills—and 1,707 instruments were found to be compatible with human rights. It is crucial to note that, while much of the attention on the committee's work focuses on legislation that is or may be incompatible with human rights, in the vast majority of cases proposed legislation is in fact compatible or, indeed, may even promote human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking back at the committee's achievements this year, I would draw attention to the committee's examination of four national security bills, introduced with the aim of ensuring Australia is best placed to combat terrorism and that law enforcement and intelligence agencies are sufficiently equipped to keep the nation safe. National security legislation necessarily strongly engages with human rights and these bills have raised complex issues around balancing the protection of human rights with national security objectives. I believe that the committee has not, since its establishment, considered any legislation as challenging in this regard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to thank my fellow committee members for their work on these bills. More generally, I would also like to thank my committee colleagues, who have engaged with the committee's work and who have done so in keeping with the scrutiny tradition of undertaking technical and bipartisan inquiry into the merits of proposed legislation and, in the case of this committee's particular task, the compatibility of proposed legislation with the human rights conventions signed up to by previous Australian governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put aside personal opinions on the policy merits of legislation is not always easy to accomplish and, for doing so in the interests of providing credible reports to inform the debates of the parliament, I recognise and commend committee members for their service to this institution and to the legislators within it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Ivan Powell, the committee secretary; Professor Simon Rice, the committee's current legal adviser; Professor Andrew Byrnes, the former legal adviser; and all the staff in the secretariat for their professionalism and hard work over the past year, which is so crucial to the committee's operation. With these comments, I commend the committee's 17th report of the 44th Parliament to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements reforms to higher education and research announced in the 2014-15 budget, which seek to spread opportunity to more students, especially disadvantaged and rural and regional students; equip Australian universities to face the challenges of the 21st century; and ensure Australia is not left behind by intensifying global competition and new technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Naturally, I am disappointed about the outcome of the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014, which was defeated yesterday in the Senate following a sustained, baseless and irresponsible scare campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should all be disappointed. That bill, in amended form, would have shown the worth of our democratic process, representing, as it did, the outcome of many months of consultation and negotiation on the detail of the reform package. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am therefore introducing a new bill, the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, which preserves essential elements of the government's higher education reforms with the following changes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The government has withdrawn the proposal to change the indexation to the 10-year Treasury bond rate. I accept that there were concerns about the impact of the previously proposed measure on some graduates, including those who take time out of the workforce to raise children or for other reasons, and those who work in low-paid employment. Senator Day and others argued cogently for this change, and we have responded to their concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">I have also listened carefully to Senator Madigan's arguments for a pause on HECS indexation for primary carers of a child under five. This bill, the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, contains this measure. It will provide real benefits for new parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">This bill also provides for a structural adjustment fund to assist universities to transition to a more competitive market, particularly those in regional areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The bill also introduces a new scholarship fund within the Higher Education and Participation Program for universities with high proportions of low-SES students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The bill will also guarantee that domestic students' fees are lower than international students' fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through returning the indexation rate for HECS debts to CPI, providing the indexation pause for new parents and abolishing the unfair loan fees imposed on some students but not others, this reform bill makes the HECS system fairer and more generous. Through the provision of support—for the first time—for all Australian undergraduates, wherever they study, in diploma courses through to bachelor degrees, we will be supporting far more students than ever before. The reform bill spreads the money slightly thinner so as to spread opportunity much wider. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through freeing up our universities, we will enable them to offer students the very best education they can, and HECS guarantees that this will remain affordable and accessible for all. In fact, the Commonwealth Scholarships will support tens of thousands of disadvantaged students to go to university. This is not just a budget measure. This is great reform. It is some of the most important reform in generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am, of course, open to further negotiations with members and senators on the details of the bill. Contrary to some of the irresponsible negative commentary from those opposite, the government has been consulting extensively before and since budget night and has demonstrated already our bona fides in responding to constructive, positive suggestions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made the changes I have mentioned to its proposed reforms because it has listened carefully to the views of those in the higher education community—universities, non-university higher education institutions, students, their parents, employers and professional organisations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have taken careful account of the recommendations of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee following its inquiry into the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have consulted with members and senators, who have relayed the views of their constituents as well as their own thoughts on the proposed reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said many times that I was prepared to make changes to the reform package to secure its passage through the parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that these reforms are nothing short of essential to the wellbeing of Australia's future economy. Without them, Australia simply will not prosper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not alone in this view. This has been the clear message from higher education institutions across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is what they want.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is what universities, TAFEs and colleges know is<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>needed for the future of higher education and for the future of our country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities Australia, the Australian Technology Network, the Innovative Research Universities, the Regional Universities Network, the Group of Eight, TAFE Directors Australia, the Australian Council of Private Higher Education and Training and the Council of Private Higher Education have all supported the government's reforms, with amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Either the status quo of ongoing inadequate investment or further cuts without deregulation will condemn Australia's great university system to inevitable decline, threaten our international reputation and make it increasingly difficult for universities to meet the quality expectations of our students <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">…</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 does not contain any tricks. It is much the same as the bill I introduced a few months ago which was yesterday defeated in the Senate, with the important amendments I outlined just a moment ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, this bill has the same objectives as its predecessor. It provides a basis to transform Australia's higher education system and allow it to be the best in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will expand access to higher education by removing current limits on Commonwealth supported sub-bachelor places.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also providing unlimited places for diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees—pathways into higher education for less-prepared students, and qualifications for jobs in their own right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government believes that engineering technologists, paralegals and construction managers are as deserving of taxpayer support to undertake their training as engineers, lawyers and architects.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform allows an additional 80,000 students each year to receive Commonwealth subsidies by 2018. This will include more people from disadvantaged backgrounds, from rural and regional communities and those who need extra assistance to complete their studies.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equitable access will be further supported through the new Commonwealth Scholarship scheme. The Commonwealth Scholarship scheme will provide what is likely to be the largest scholarship support in Australia's history for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, which will enable many students from rural and regional Australia to get the education that they wish to have. These scholarships will assist students with the cost of tuition fees and also with the cost of living, textbooks and materials.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does not believe it should tell institutions how much they can charge for a course. Government control of fees means that institutions are operating with one arm tied behind their back.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants universities and other higher education institutions to compete with each other, including on price.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee deregulation is essential to drive greater competition, innovation and quality. It will enable our institutions to set their own direction, serve their students and communities as well as they can, and compete with the best in the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to HECS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">HECS is critical to ensuring that no student is denied the benefit of a higher education. Providing assistance to students through HECS comes at a cost. This year the government is providing more than $5 billion in HECS loans, and this will increase to $10 billion in 2017. The government sought to introduce a fair interest rate on loans to alleviate taxpayers of some of this cost burden. However, as I indicated earlier, I have removed this proposal from the package, and as a consequence it is not contained within this bill. HECS indexation will continue to be based on the CPI.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have indicated, the bill also reflects Senator Madigan's proposal to freeze interest charges for the primary carers of a child under five. This family-friendly proposal joins with Senator Day's proposal in taking us back to CPI for indexation of HECS debts, and goes further. It provides a wholly new benefit to graduates caring for young children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the important thing is, HECS is here to stay, so no Australian student need ever pay a cent up-front for their higher education course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our HECS system is the envy of the world—introduced by the Hawke-Keating government, in fact. But one thing that is clearly wrong with the student loan system is the 25 per cent additional fee that is imposed on students who choose to study in a non-Commonwealth supported place, and the 20 per cent on students studying with the support of VET FEE-HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government is acting to make the system fairer by removing inequities in the treatment of students and institutions under the HECS scheme. Consistent with the budget announcement, the bill removes the 20 per cent loan fee for VET FEE-HELP and the 25 per cent loan fee for FEE-HELP. These loan fees are an unfair cost on those students who are not receiving a Commonwealth subsidy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the loan fee makes the system fairer and will simplify and improve the consistency of loan arrangements for students and institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also remove price inequity between public universities and other institutions. It will particularly benefit students who elect to undertake higher-level courses at institutions such as TAFEs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 80,000 students undertaking vocational education and training and 50,000 higher education students will benefit each year from the removal of the loan fee. In 2013, the average cost of these per student was around $1,600 for VET FEE-HELP and $2,600 for FEE-HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lifetime limits on all HECS schemes are also being removed as they result in students paying up-front costs which can provide a significant barrier to access.

If evidence of this is needed, look no further than the $6.6 billion of cuts that Labor announced from 2011. This is hardly the way for Australia's third biggest export industry to run.</span>

If the bill does not pass, the Future Fellowships scheme will cease, and many of our best researchers will be forced to leave. The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy will cease, putting 1,500 researchers out of a job. The loss of these two programs alone will do irreparable damage to our capacity to support high-quality research.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 2014 higher education budget reforms are necessary. They are logical, coherent, sustainable, equitable and inevitable … My guess is that the detractors of micro-economic reform in Australia's higher education industry will find themselves on the wrong side of history in resisting efficiency improvement and innovation, as they will be in opposing the redistributive measures of the package and, curiously, supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged segments of the community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 will allow our higher education system to be the best in the world. It will ensure that future generations of Australians can get a world-class education to support them in the jobs of the future. It will provide the backbone of our future economy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-Time">This bill forms part of the broader suite of repeal day legislationthat has been introduced into the House to honour the coalition government's election commitment to cut $1 billion in red and green tape each year.I therefore wish to take this opportunity to speak on this broader repeal day topic, and the great achievements of the coalition during our short period in government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-Time">Over the previous six years under Labor, we witnessed a regular pattern of a government overpromising and underdelivering. Who could forget the former Treasurer's 2012 budget night announcement:</span>
                  </span>
                </p>

                    <span class="HPS-Time">The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement ... This budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-Time">Of course, what we saw was six consecutive years of an ever-growing budget deficit.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-Time">In contrast, since the 2013 election, the coalition government has more than doubled our election target of red tape reduction, announcing over 400 measures across the whole of government and a net reduction of over $2.1 billion in compliance costs.</span>
                  </span>

                    <span class="HPS-Time">As part of the 2014 Spring Repeal Day on 29 October, the government continued this work by removing nearly 1,000 pieces and over 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation. This continues the work of the first repeal day in March, where the government removed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation and over $700 million of compliance costs.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-Time">This government's policy efforts will result in more efficient government and more productive business and not-for-profit sectors. This will improve our nation's competitiveness, helping to create more jobs while lowering household costs.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-Time">In contrast, Labor introduced more than 21,000 additional regulations, stifling investment and job creation, despite Kevin Rudd's promise of a 'one regulation in, one regulation out' policy and the then small business minister, Craig Emerson, saying in 2008 that Labor would 'take a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small business.'</span>
                  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-Time">This legislation before us today isanother example that bad regulation and too much regulation hurts productivity, deters investment and innovation and costs jobs.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following six years of hard Labor government, our great country ranks 124th out of 148 countries for burden of government regulation in the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index. This year we improved four spots on last year, and we are still behind Colombia and Spain and just in front of Iran—hardly a ranking we should be proud of. This is our nation's shame. Over-regulation directly affects our efficiency. The Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, there were nearly 100 examples of non-compliant and prime ministerial exempt regulatory impact statements. These included some of Labor's most significant legislative changes such as the mining tax, the NBN, the future of financial advice laws, and changes to the Fair Work Act. These measures all escaped detailed regulatory impact scrutiny following exemptions granted by prime ministers Rudd and Gillard. The Borthwick-Milliner review, commissioned by Labor and reporting last year, found a widespread lack of acceptance of and commitment to the regulatory impact assessment process by ministers and agencies. This is not the way that strong effective and honest government operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Abbott government has introduced a comprehensive form of reform agenda. Our deregulation measures include: (1) minimising and simplifying interaction with government; (2) reducing regulatory obligations and reporting; (3) fuelling economic growth; and (4) common sense reforms. We are committed to a new approach where we must first ask what is the purpose, cost and impact on productivity of proposed initiatives before regulating. Only after these questions are answered, and only when it is absolutely necessary with no sensible alternatives available, should government proceed to regulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already implemented several substantial amendments to the regulatory process including: (a) requiring cabinet submissions proposing legislative changes with a significant regulatory impact to be subject to the regulatory impact assessment process, governed by the new government guide to regulation; (b) establishing designated deregulation units within ministers' departments and finalising ministerial advisory committees to advise on deregulation priorities and opportunities for cutting regulation; (c) where appropriate, linking the remuneration of senior members of the public service to their performance in reducing red and green tape; (d) the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has taken over responsibility for deregulation and the Office of Best Practice Regulation, previously located in the Department of Finance; (e) the Productivity Commission has prepared a framework for auditing the performance of regulators; (f) deregulation will be a standing item on the COAG agenda to enable the federal and state governments to cut duplication and over regulation. In addition, the government will also: (a) tackle the volume of regulation, which is clearly already too high; (b) work to eliminate the extensive duplication and regulatory overlap that exists between different layers of government, particularly between federal and state regulation; (c) improve the quality of consultation between government and those to be affected by any new regulations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, this legislation forms part of this government's broader repeal day reform agenda. Our policies have received a range of third party endorsements that I would like to share with the House. Jennifer Westacott, Chief Executive of the Business Council of Australia, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Nicholson, Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, has said: 'We warmly welcome the government's red tape reduction agenda.

The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Repeal Day) Bill 2014 forms part of our government's commitment to repeal counterproductive and redundant legislation and regulations. This bill amends various laws relating to taxation, superannuation and shareholdings in certain financial sector companies to implement a range of improvements to Australia's laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to repeal the payslip reporting provisions. The payslip reporting provisions in Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 require employers to include in employee payslips information prescribed by the regulations. If employers were required to report actual contributions on payslips they would need to invest in major upgrades in their software, and the benefit would likely be only marginal. Removing these provisions will reduce unnecessary duplication in the law and provide certainty to employers. Schedule 2 of this bill simplifies the taxation laws by consolidating duplicated taxation administration provisions contained in various taxation acts into a single set of provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Schedule 2 of this bill also repeals spent or redundant taxation laws and moves longstanding regulations into primary law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tidying up our tax laws is an important part of the care and maintenance of our tax system. Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 so that persons who do not hold a direct control interest in a financial sector company will no longer be deemed to have a stake in the financial sector company as a consequence of their associates direct control interests. Currently, the law requires that associates of a person who is seeking a shareholding in excess of 15 per cent also seek approval for the shareholding. This is required irrespective of whether an associate has any actual shareholding or financial interest in the company in which the new shareholding is sought. These associates are caught by the wide definition of 'associate' in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, which requires them to undertake this action for no real policy benefit. With the changes in this bill, associates with no direct interest in the company will no longer be required to seek approval and will no longer be caught in a technical trap that requires them to hold approval under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of this bill addresses the fact that currently the definition of 'Australia' for taxation purposes is complex, overly detailed and expressed differently in different parts of the taxation laws, despite the fact that the laws are intended to achieve a simple and largely equivalent result. Schedule 4 rewrites the definition of 'Australia' into a single location in the tax law, for use across all the tax laws, in a simple and coherent form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Progressively removing individual pieces of unnecessary  red tape and regulation and making our law simpler and shorter plays an important role in helping Australia's economy become more efficient. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014 is an important one, and it is supported by the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I quote from the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary on the introduction of this important bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commercial Building Disclosure Program, supported by the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010, continues to represent one of the most cost-effective opportunities to reduce the use of energy in commercial buildings and improve productivity across the sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since its commencement in November 2011, the CBD Program has transformed the commercial property market. Office buildings with better energy efficiency ratings consistently deliver greater returns for investors, and energy efficiency is now considered a normal part of commercial property transactions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commercial building and energy efficiency stakeholders have been actively engaged in the CBD Program and continue to support its important role in driving energy productivity across Australia's property sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commercial building sector is responsible for around 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions, and this figure is rising. That is why it is extremely important that we have a bipartisan approach to energy efficiency, and, on this occasion, to energy efficiency in commercial buildings and that we understand that there is a direct link between energy efficiency and commercial advantage to building owners and to tenants from these initiatives. Energy conservation, energy efficiency and demand management are very important tools of the new age in managing higher electricity prices, and, importantly, in managing the greenhouse impact of our very large commercial buildings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy efficiency of course represents one of the fastest and cheapest ways that we can reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The amendments bill proposed by the government is simply a set of housekeeping measures in response to changes that had been, properly, proposed by stakeholders through stakeholder forums. They are changes that will reduce red tape. They are changes that will make this act function better, and they are changes that are supported not just by the stakeholders but by both sides of this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to the Energy Efficiency Council, the Clean Energy Council and the Green Building Council—all of them accept and support these important changes. We have also had interaction with the Property Council. It would be fair to say that the Property Council has a range of different views around the CBD program. On the one hand, they have indicated that the program is a good program, but they would like to see changes. On the other hand, at times they have called for the CBD program to be scrapped. We on this side of the House do not think this would be a prudent move. We do think that the appointment of ASIL Tasman to review the program by March 2015 is something about which we are concerned. We look forward to receiving that report. But we are concerned that a review that may be directed to remove the CBD program would not be a prudent way to support energy conservation and bring about all the great advantages that come through this program, which the parliamentary secretary referred to in his second reading speech in October this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy efficiency is not just the national agenda. It binds all levels of government in a virtuous cycle. In this, the role played by all state governments dovetails with initiatives that the Commonwealth has put in place to support energy efficiency. High energy prices help to focus our minds on energy efficiency. Householders do not care what their unit price for energy is—they care what their regular bill is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, in the context of energy efficiency, the International Energy Agency's <span style="font-style:italic;">Energy</span> e<span style="font-style:italic;">fficiency </span><span style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span style="font-style:italic;">arket </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport </span>of 2014<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>found that energy efficiency is rapidly becoming the world's first fuel. It is a terrific and very sensible idea. Energy and efficiency improvements in 11 countries, including Australia, delivered more capacity than any other source of energy in 2014. It is a remarkable fact that more energy was saved by conservation than by oil, coal or gas in 2014. Energy efficiency saved those countries 56 exajoules of energy in 2012, which is more than the final energy delivered by oil, electricity or natural gas—indeed, it is more than the total energy consumption of the European Union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean for the development of policies that have energy efficiency at the core? We can remove the supply-side bias that exists traditionally in the energy markets. The purpose of network companies is to provide affordable and reliable connection between an energy consumer and an energy supplier, but sometimes the most affordable way to boost reliability is to manage peak demand and put in place sensible energy-efficiency measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our regulations often mean that network companies face incentives to keep energy demand high and therefore build more kit. We have seen this in electricity, and we have seen a pretty good draft decision, in the last week, on energy network, prices and costs. That decision—we hope—will drive a better profile of costs for consumers, industries and customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In electricity, in recent years, the lack of cost-reflective tariffs for peak demand has meant that Australians have installed lots of poorly-performing air conditioners—driving up peak demand, adding to problems and making markets unstable. Cross-subsidies meant that households without air conditioning paid, effectively, a $700-a-year cost to subsidise households with air conditioning. Politicians, energy producers and consumers can no longer afford to underestimate the importance of energy efficiency and efficient energy markets. There are some simple energy-efficiency measures that should be encouraged, like more efficient space and water heating, tariff reforms and price reflectivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and the way in which it works, in commercial office space, is particularly insightful. The measures in this amendment that make it work more smoothly and make it work better for stakeholders are to be supported. I flag, again, my concern—and the opposition's concern—about any move to remove the CBD. We see the CBD program itself as delivering substantial benefits. Those benefits, as I began in my presentation this morning, were largely and accurately identified by the parliamentary secretary when he introduced this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Major changes proposed in this bill provide for exemptions to building owners who receive unsolicited offers for the sale or lease of their office spaces. That, we believe, will lead to around a $300,000 estimated reduction in the regulatory burden on businesses. That reduction of the cost burden on businesses is important and is wholly supported by this place. Allowing transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries to be excluded from disclosure obligations will again lead to around a $300,000 reduction in the regulatory burden on businesses. In total, we look forward to in excess of half a million dollars in savings delivered directly to commercial office-space owners and people who rent those spaces in the CBDs of our cities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing ambiguity in the main act, in relation to the status of assessments undertaken by assessors accredited under the National Australian Built Environment Rating System, the NABERS program, but not accredited under the CBD program, is important. Introducing the ability to determine a commencement date for building energy-efficiency certification, which is later than the date of issue, is also important. It provides greater flexibility for businesses wishing to proactively maintain their current building energy-efficiency certificates for their property portfolios. It removes the need for new owners and lessors to reapply or pay the application for fresh exemptions if there is an existing one in place for a building. This is also important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We find ourselves at the point, with this bill, where we are wholly in support of its objectives and of the streamlining that has been introduced in these measures. We are extremely cautious at the possibility of the CBD program itself being called into question in the first quarter of next year, and the opposition would like to flag at this moment its great concern. The CBD program itself should be maintained and the commercial benefits that are so profound and so obvious should be maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The BEED Act requires energy-efficiency information to be disclosed. In most cases, when commercial office space of 2,000 square metres or more is offered for sale or lease the BEED Act aims to ensure that credible and meaningful energy-efficiency information is given to prospective purchasers and lessees of large commercial office space. This information helps purchasers or lessees to make more informed decisions and to take full account of the economic costs and environmental impacts associated with operating buildings when they are intending to purchase or lease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really about market information providing a market signal that can be properly understood in a properly functioning market. In that context, this program works. It should be made to work as efficiently as it possibly can. These amendments are insightful in that they do that—they reduce the cost of the application of this act. They are supported, not just by the opposition and the government—that, of course, is critically important—but by the industry that deals in this space. Therefore, this bill is to be supported by this House, supported by the opposition, with the caution that we remain very concerned about the future of the CBD itself. We hope that the government takes on board those concerns. Should the government, at any time, be considering changes to the CBD itself, please be aware that the functioning of that program is extremely important. It provides valuable market processes for ensuring that building owners and future tenants are best informed, it provides an incentive for building owners to make their buildings as energy efficient as they can be, and it allows tenants themselves to take spaces in buildings that are well built, well managed and maintained to the highest energy efficiency standards.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  It is good to rise on another bill, the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014, which implements the government's commitment to reducing red tape, but in this case potentially green tape, in consultation with industry and other stakeholders to ensure that we have better best practice regulation in place in Australia. I thank the member for Brand, the shadow minister and the opposition for supporting what is a common sense measure. The member for Brand is one of the rare members of the shadow ministry who understands the importance of consulting with industry, listening to them and working with them and not against them, unlike many of his colleagues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the member for Brand made some compelling arguments, I do not necessarily agree with his view that you need to have legislation in place in all of these areas and that it is absolutely necessary. The biggest incentive in commercial buildings is, of course, the commercial incentive—that is, to operate them at the lowest cost possible and to operate them in the best way possible. That is good business. It may not require a law. Having a review to understand this—whether this is now necessary—is a very worthwhile endeavour and something we should continue as a commitment to governments of all persuasions in order to reduce the burden of regulation, the number of laws and the unnecessary laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case today with the price of electricity and the way buildings are invested in and structured that you of course have to consider energy efficiency—not because the law says so and not because it is the good intention of any particular government but because there is a prime commercial incentive. You would not have a business in this country not considering energy efficiency when investing in a commercial building at the moment. For the member for Brand to say we need these acts of parliament often without any real backup is unnecessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The particular changes in this bill that provide exemptions to building owners who receive unsolicited offers for the sale of their office space are going to lead to about $300,000 in estimated reduction of regulatory burden on businesses—about half a million dollars, as the shadow minister noted. We ask the questions, 'Do we need this? Can this be improved? Can this legislation be reduced?' These are the kinds of real-world savings that will produce great productivity benefits to business. That half a million dollars can be spent in other ways by these businesses that will produce a greater return and will allow them to have more time and more space to do more productive activity in our economy. This process can be continued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely starkly obvious that we need a disclosure scheme in general. I am very happy to have a look at it. I am very happy to see whether we need to have it in the future. The commercial incentives are there now for this to happen automatically and for the market to function without having to have a regulation in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other provisions are also very important. We remove the requirement for six pages of standard energy efficiency guidance text on the building energy certificates. Instead, live interactive online information about energy efficiency for office buildings will be put in place. This is just a contemporary updating of legislation to take advantage of online mechanisms. It meets the need for new owners and lessors to pay the application fee for a fresh exemption if there is a valid one in place. Again, they are common sense measures. Too often with these pieces of legislation that are passed by this parliament, especially when they deal with energy or environmental concerns, there are too many restrictions and too many penalties and too many requirements that really do not have a practical, environmental or energy benefit. These are very sensible measures. The requirements cost industry time, energy, effort and money without producing any real benefits. Again, they are sensible proposals that both sides of the chamber can support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other things can be looked at, particularly regarding the defunct Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act and scheme. In particular, we heard evidence in open committee, through my chairmanship of the Standing Committee on the Environment, that there have to be yearly or annual inspections of light fixtures in commercial buildings by law, even though these energy efficient fixtures can sometimes only be replaced every five years. Why you would require them to be inspected annually is beyond me. It is another area that of course has to be changed. Things can be improved. Obviously, the energy efficiency act is the subject of another move from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what I am getting at: these pieces of legislation are well-intentioned at the time—sometimes they have a positive effect—but quickly you get to a point where they are too prescriptive and too onerous in their requirements without looking at the benefit produced by the particular regulations themselves. There is no doubt that, when you look at the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act, there is too much of that going on. That has been recognised and agreed to by both sides with the passage of this bill. Of course, in the future we will be looking for further savings in areas where this act can be improved, so that there is more flexibility for business and, of course, more opportunity for people to get on with what they should be getting on with. Energy efficiency is very important; there are savings to be made. There are reasons why you would do it, but, given the fact that there are good commercial reasons—in fact, it is the prime imperative for most businesses who are acting on their building and other investments at this point in time—it is not obvious that we need to have in place so many of these regulatory mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All up, of course, the government is very committed to supporting business through the reduction of red tape in improving energy productivity. The bill is going to lead to close to $600,000 worth of reductions in regulatory burdens. It is yet another step in our ongoing red- and green-tape reduction. I look forward to seeing more of these amendments being supported by both sides of the House in the future to ensure that we are moving with the times and not allowing pieces of legislation, such as the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act, to become out of date, and to put a regulatory burden on business with no real return for the environment or of energy efficiency.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I thank members of the government for assisting me to deliver my contribution on this bill. Labor supports energy conservation. Labor's Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act of 2010 established a legal requirement for owners of large commercial office buildings to obtain energy efficiency information for their building and to disclose it to prospective purchasers and lessees. It also required head tenants who were subletting office spaces to disclose this information. The energy efficiency information disclosed is in the form of a building energy efficiency certificate. This certificate includes a star rating of the building's energy efficiency, an assessment of tenancy lighting, and additional guidance on how the energy efficiency of the office may be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commercial building sector is responsible for around 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions, and this figure is rising. It needs to be pointed out that energy efficiency represents one of the fastest and cheapest ways we can reduce our nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Credible energy efficiency information helps parties to make better informed decisions and to take full account of the economic costs and the environmental impacts associated with operating the buildings they are intending to purchase or to lease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy efficiency requirements are an important complementary measure in the suite of policies we need for addressing climate change, such as for new homes and major renovations. Part of the five-star standard, which is now up to six stars, is a requirement for new homes in Victoria to have either a solar hot water heater or a rainwater tank. These are cheap things to install when you are building a house, but more expensive to retrofit later. Many builders do not seriously consider them because they are going for the absolute lowest total cost they can. But they are simple changes which do no harm to people's standard of living, but have huge, positive impacts concerning water and energy use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy used by our buildings accounts for approximately 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, split fairly evenly between homes and commercial buildings. The business sector is by far the largest energy user in the Australian economy. The industrial sector alone accounts for almost half of Australia's energy end-use and for around two-thirds of stationary energy use. Australia has one of the more energy intensive industrial sectors among developed countries. Energy consumed by residential appliances and industrial and commercial equipment is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the benefits in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, the Commercial Building Disclosure program has a much broader range of impacts, which are not always captured or measured, such as increased industry capacity and potential building upgrades, that go beyond improving just the energy efficiency of a building and may improve water use, indoor environment quality or other elements. A recent World Green Building Council report provides information regarding the benefits that greener buildings can have on health, wellbeing and productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now also well documented that buildings with an environmental rating deliver better returns, so the Commercial Building Disclosure program is helping to deliver increased value in the market. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Building better returns </span>report of 2011 found that Green Star rated buildings deliver a 12 per cent green premium in value and a five per cent premium in rent when compared to non-rated buildings. Quarterly research by IPD also shows that the Green Star and NABERS rated buildings outperform non-rated buildings. The International Energy Agency's <span style="font-style:italic;">Energy Efficiency Market</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2014</span> found that energy efficiency improvements in 11 countries, including Australia, delivered more capacity than any other source of energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greener offices are not only more comfortable to work in, they can also boost productivity, bring down sick leave, support green building-industry jobs and have the potential to deliver savings of 20 to 40 per cent on energy bills. Energy efficiency is a fast, cheap way of making inroads into Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. We need to do that, because Australia has become an international embarrassment on climate change action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to a group of senior British conservatives, the attitude of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to the global challenges of climate change is 'eccentric', 'baffling' and 'flat earther'. The group—including Prime Minister David Cameron's minister for energy, a former Thatcher minister and chairman of the Conservative Party—says Mr Abbott's position on climate change represents a betrayed of the fundamental ideals of conservatism and those of his political heroine, Margaret Thatcher. Twenty-five years ago, former British Prime Minister Thatcher addressed the United Nations and placed climate change firmly on the global environmental agenda. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is mankind and his activities which are changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These British conservatives warn that Australia is taking enormous risks investing in coal, and will come under increasing market and political pressure to play its part in the global battle against climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Lord Deben, chairman of the Independent Climate Change Commission and a minister in both the Thatcher and Major governments, Australia will come under increasing market pressure to respond to the global shift towards renewable energy. Lord Deben said that Mr Abbott had betrayed the fundamental tenets of conservatism itself. He has been quoted as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have no doubt that people like David Cameron will be saying to Tony Abbott 'look conservatives are supposed to conserve, they are supposed to hand on to the next generation something better than they received themselves'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed! Tim Yeo, the chairman of the UK's parliamentary select committee on Energy and Climate Change and a former environment minister under John Major, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Kingdom led the world in 2008 by legislating for long-term, ambitious emissions reductions of 80 per cent by 2050. They have already achieved a 25 per cent drop on 1990 levels. In June, David Cameron opened the world's largest offshore wind farm with 175 turbines in the Thames Estuary. Almost 20 per cent of Britain's electricity is now produced by renewables, with eight per cent powered by wind—equivalent to 6½ million homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UK's energy market reforms and the drive to transform the economy to a low-carbon model are supported by all the major political parties. David Cameron's former Minister for Energy and Climate Change, Greg Barker, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think there is a lot of concern about Australia … people are concerned, slightly baffled by the approach that Australia is taking which looks, actually, slightly eccentric.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You know that your climate change agenda is in trouble when your traditional conservative allies start seeing you as a pre-science troglodyte. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was further highlighted when the world's two superpowers signed a climate change deal, which I believe is the best news on international action to tackle climate change in nearly 20 years—the best news since the Kyoto protocol. It is an absolutely stunning agreement. China has agreed to ramp up its renewable energy target by one third—over 30 per cent—compared to its previous offer. This will build a massive solar PV industry. Secondly, it has agreed to level-out its emissions by 2030. Given that China's emissions accounted for 70 per cent of the global increase in emissions in 2012, this is a huge turnaround. It is a world away from the sabotage they engaged in at Copenhagen, which I strongly criticised at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we hear from government ministers about this historic agreement? The Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development said it was a distraction. Indeed, the trade minister, Treasurer and foreign minister all lined up to have a crack. The foreign minister went so far as to send a briefing to the White House in response to President Obama's speech on climate change and the impact that it will have on the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foreign minister said that she did not believe the reef was in danger. That is a view that contradicts the scientific consensus that it is in danger. For example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Barrier Reef Ou</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tlook Report</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2014 </span>from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that only this government fails to accept that climate change is going to take a significant toll on our Great Barrier Reef unless we take action now. The diplomatic push-back against the United States was petulant, and underscores how isolated Australia is becoming on climate change—an international embarrassment, a shag on a rock.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been put on the back foot by the US-China deal, and by comments from world leaders, during and after the G20 summit, highlighting the importance of global action to address climate change, including contributions to the international Green Climate Fund. Even Canada, a country that previously lined up with Australia against contributions to the Green Climate Fund, has now come on board with a $300 million contribution. Thirty countries have pledged $9.3 billion to the fund—just shy of a $10 billion target—to help developing countries cut emissions and prepare for global warming.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Korea-based Green Climate Fund aims to help nations invest in clean energy and green technology and build up defences against rising seas and worsening storms, floods and droughts. Money will be spent equally for climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially for the most vulnerable nations, including small island nations and Africa's poorest countries. The fund is designed to help those countries least to blame for, but most at risk from, climate change, with grants, loans and private capital for projects such as solar and wind farms, planting trees or disaster-proofing infrastructure. While other countries are contributing, Australia has ruled out contributing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN climate experts have cautioned that there is no time to lose in the battle against global warming. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in November that time is running out to limit warming to two degrees Celsius by 2100 on pre-industrial levels. They said we are on a likely trajectory for at least a four-degree Celsius warming, which is a recipe for melting ice caps, extreme weather events, habitat and species loss, and conflict over access to scarce resources.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the key risks that were identified included: low-lying coastal zones and small islands being vulnerable to storm surges; more frequent flooding in urban areas; breakdown in infrastructure and critical services such as electricity, water supply, health and emergency services due to increases in extreme weather events; increase in deaths and illness due to extreme heatwaves; risk of food insecurity due to warming, drought and flooding; significant drops in agricultural production and rural livelihoods; loss of marine and coastal ecosystems with significant impacts on fishing communities and industry; and threats to native species and ecosystems.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IPCC report focused on the risks posed by global warming, concluding that in many cases the world is ill prepared. Indeed, the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef topped the local risk list, with the IPCC warning that permanent damage is inevitable. Our leading coral reefs marine scientist and lead author Ove Hoegh-Guldberg said mitigation strategies, such as improving water quality and reducing fishing pressure, will only 'buy time' for the reef.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  Before the minister leaves the chamber, I want to commend him on the work that he has done particularly in relation to our environment policies. I am sure the minister remembers very well the previous government's failed programs on the environment. There were 20 failures—10 failures of Prime Minister Rudd and 10 failures of Prime Minister Gillard. For a start—and the previous speaker introduced this to the debate—there was the carbon tax. The broken promise on that is a great place to start. There was a promise that there would be no carbon tax, and there was one. We also had the Home Insulation Program. As we know, it was linked to four tragedies. It was responsible for 224 house fires. It has seen 70,000 repairs. That is what the previous government saw as environmental policy at a cost of more than $2.1 billion, of which more than half a billion dollars was simply to fix dangerous roofs. The program was delivered in spite of 21 warnings by the former member for Griffith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the Green Loans Program. It was a Rudd government program. We know that the Green Loans Program wasted $100 million and retrofitted just over 1,000 homes. The Citizens' Assembly program was scrapped before it even started. That was Prime Minister Gillard's initiative. There was the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. That had a $500 million cost overrun. When the previous speaker was talking about environment policy, that is what he was talking about. He obviously has a selective memory. There was the Solar Flagships program. After some years, there was not one watt of energy and not a thing built. That was an announcement from the member for Griffith. We saw all promise and no delivery at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the infamous cash-for-clunkers scheme. That was, again, an initiative of Prime Minister Gillard. The Green Car Innovation Fund was another spectacular failure. The low emission plan for renters collapsed. These were the programs and practical measures that the previous speaker on the debate in this House was talking about. There were the green technology grants, which stopped and started and stopped and started after the MYEFO came out. Those were another failure. There was the Connecting Renewables Initiative. It folded. The Renewable Energy Future Fund was absolutely squandered. The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute unfortunately delivered far more dinners and conferences than progress on carbon capture. We saw the huge number of dollars that went into that program. The green buildings for tax breaks initiative was scrapped before it commenced. The phantom credits were scrapped 2½ years early. Simply advertising the carbon tax was $70 million wasted. The Green Start program was scrapped before it commenced. The contracts for closure were scrapped before commencement. So, after listening to the previous member speak in this House, all I can say is that those opposite obviously have a selective memory when it comes to their own environmental programs and their impact. We saw even with the carbon tax that there was no defined decrease in emission. But what a massive cost to business and households that was. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There also appears to be a lack of understanding about the innovation that is out there in this space. I do not know how many other members meet so many innovative groups and individuals who are working on environmental solutions, often using their own initiative and their own funds. They are certainly making a huge difference. Look at what has happened in the transport sector and how they have improved their performance over the years—for example, the Euro V engines. They are now looking at a Euro VI. There is a lot of work yet to be done, but that is what has been happening in transport. Of course, so many businesses and industries have done enormous work in the environment sector. They are not sitting on their hands. They are proactive in this space. As I said, I see a lot of innovation ahead, and it is ongoing. I think the practical measures that we are taking as a government feed directly into that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, one of those is something as simple as the Green Army. There are those who have sought to make this out to be some sort of joke; it is no joke on the ground. I am a farmer, and those young people out on the ground actually delivering practical outcomes is exactly what we need. We need things that actually work on the ground, where the taxpayers' dollars get to the ground and get to the practical programs that make a difference. Be it coastal, be it in rivers or be it in riparian areas, there is so much practical work happening on the ground, and that is exactly what we need to encourage. Things that make a difference at a local level, collectively make a huge difference. So I encourage anybody looking at the Green Army Program to get involved, because there is a lot of opportunity at a local level. This will build to 15,000 people on the ground—literally a Green Army working on practical measures. Our natural resource management groups and the catchment councils, which have been working so hard for so long, do the same practical things. No wonder this is a program that will work, because they are already doing this type of work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I once had a member opposite say to me in a committee that she was surprised that I was on the environment committee, because I was a farmer. Let me tell you that over 94 per cent of farmers are involved in natural resource management or Landcare groups. They are very concerned and very interested, because they then hand on their own property to a next generation of farmers—be it family members or anyone who purchases that property. They want to see that property in the best condition it can be so that it can continue to produce quality food or fibre which this country is renowned for. You can only do that if you are looking after your pastures, if you are looking after your soil and if you are using the right fertilisers. Farming is a science. We have some amazing people working on the land. They are constantly looking at how to do their work better, whether they are an irrigation farmer—looking at how to irrigate more efficiently for so many environmental reasons as well as commercial reasons, and also to manage their pasture—or whatever the case may be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures are going on constantly. Members opposite talk as if nothing is happening anywhere, but there are very practical measures happening right across this country in all fields, and there is much more innovation ahead. We see it every day, almost, in this place and out on the ground. I think we are going to see a lot more innovation in this space than people give us credit for. The measures of this government will add to that, as will practical measures such as adaptation. In the environment committee, we will keep working on a range of matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill will streamline the administrative process. We have discussed in this place previously matters around greater efficiency and reduction, in various ways, of red tape—or green tape in some people's views. Of course, this will, under the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act, address stakeholders' concerns and reduce regulatory burdens on industry. It is very important to stay competitive. We know that in this country we have a productivity challenge. Every way that we can possibly improve productivity for business and individuals is exactly where governments should try to get out of the way, because it is business that creates the jobs and invests their own dollars. So assisting to streamline this process is a very good outcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act, as we know, requires energy efficiency information to be disclosed in most cases when commercial office space of 2,000 square metres or more is offered for sale or lease. The act aims to ensure that credible and meaningful energy efficiency information is given to prospective purchasers and lessees of large commercial office space. That information helps purchasers or lessees to make more informed decisions and take full account of the economic costs and the environmental impacts associated with operating the buildings when they are intending to purchase or lease. Since the establishment of the CBD program, there have been a number of proposed changes raised through the regular forums with key industry stakeholders to improve the program. Again, that is common sense. Those changes require legislative amendments to the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act and associated legislative instruments, including the building energy efficiency regulations and determinations. The major changes include providing exemptions to building owners who receive unsolicited offers for the sale or lease of their office space. That will lead to an $0.3 million estimated reduction of regulatory burden on businesses. That is not insignificant, as every cent counts in business and your time counts because of time costs. Another major change is allowing transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries to be excluded from disclosure obligations </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this leads to a similar reduction of $0.3 million in regulatory burden on businesses. Cumulatively, it is very important. This bill addresses the ambiguity in the status of assessments in the BEED Act which undertaken by assessors accredited under the National Australian Built Environment Rating System program but not accredited under the CBD program. It also introduces the ability to determine a commencement date for a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate, which is later than the date of issue. That simple measure itself will provide greater flexibility for businesses wishing to proactively maintain current BEECs for their property portfolios.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another practical measure is removing the need for new owners and lessors to reapply or pay the application fee for fresh exemptions if there is an existing one in place for a building; and another is the removal of the requirement for six pages of standard energy efficiency guidance text on the BEEC by providing live and interactive online information about improving energy efficiency for office buildings instead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will lead to an estimated $600 million reduction of regulatory burden on businesses and, as I said, any reduction in regulatory burden is what business and industry for some time have been crying out for. As a government, you can respond in a practical way or you can ignore those calls. Every small and incremental change brings about a major change in the business itself—time and the costs involved—and as a result I hope that across all the fields where we are looking at the reduction of red and green tape we will see a streamlining of process and reductions in business costs, while still maintaining the standards that we require as a nation. I want to mention another company in my electorate that is doing a lot of innovative work with wooden building structures. I am sure that they already have a prototype up and running and that we will see more of these types of building in the future. A lot of interest is being shown in their efforts, and I commend them for their activities.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I am very disappointed with the member for Forrest—she is actually an intelligent, capable person. I cannot believe that the twaddle we have just heard from her. There was not one mention of climate change. She says she supports science and wants to see us being informed by science in the decisions we make. Yet scientists across Australia and the world are telling us that we are facing an enormous challenge in terms of global warming; that this global warming has been created by man; and that we need to take action to reduce our carbon footprint. All we hear from the other side is bleating—this uninformed, unintelligent bleating about green tape and red tape. The other side of the House are wrapping our planet in black tape—they are wrapping our planet in a cloud of fossil-fuel emissions and they are not prepared to do anything about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole premise of the member for Forrest's speech was that the most important thing that we can do is reduce costs. I would challenge that that is the most important thing to do but, even if that were the premise, putting energy efficiency in place is the critical thing. It is one of the critical things we have to do to put ourselves on the path to an economic future. This piece of legislation, which has been modified to some extent—and we as a party are supporting these modifications—offers an economic incentive for those who build and manage commercial buildings to ensure that these buildings operate in an energy efficient way. That incentive saves money for business; it saves money for small business. Those who do not build commercial buildings now have an option to make massive savings to their bottom line by leasing buildings that have been designed to be energy efficient. We have to put a market signal in there, and having mandatory disclosure is part of that market signal. In turn mandatory disclosure drives behaviour; it ensures that those people who construct large commercial buildings now have a financial incentive to invest up-front in the design and the technology that goes into a more energy efficient way of operating those buildings, while reducing our carbon footprint and reducing the costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great tragedy in this piece of legislation is that we are not moving forward in the way that was planned in 2009, when COAG agreed that the states and the Commonwealth would come together to develop a national partnership agreement on energy efficiency. It was agreed in 2009 that not only would energy efficiency disclosure requirements apply to commercial buildings but also to residential buildings so that if you were selling or on-selling you would have a mandatory disclosure or a star rating for the home you were buying. I have to say it was a great tragedy that that was deferred in 2011-2012 because the states lost interest and they peeled away their support for what was a cooperative arrangement. I think we have done a great disservice to the people of Australia—to those young people who are buying new houses or apartments. We are sentencing them to a lifetime of high costs because we have not given the market signal or the incentive for property developers or builders to get their act together and put in place the technologies that would deliver a cheaper cost of living for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was a minister in state government we did a great deal of research on lifting standards in home building. We required a greater degree of energy efficiency, and we did very, very detailed cost-benefit analyses. This was resisted mindlessly and violently by the industry at the time. They said, 'It's going to increase the cost of housing.' The economic analysis that we did showed that, whilst there was, I agree, an increment of cost of a couple of thousand dollars onto the cost of a mortgage, within the first year the increased mortgage repayments were more than offset by the saving in utility payments, in electricity and water payments. In terms of the whole-of-life cycle, the cost of living was driven right down. We could not get intelligent engagement from the industry. I am very glad to see that there has been a change of leadership in some of the largest building companies in Western Australia. I believe that under this new leadership, particularly in companies like BGC, we would see a very different response now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are supporting this bill. There are some question marks for me around whether or not we should be allowing an exemption where there has been, supposedly, a non-solicited bid. I think there are potentially some problems around the enforcement of that, and that it has the capacity to be misused. I would like to see us go much further and ensure that we do this for residential building.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give an example of the appalling things that we see. As mayor of Vincent I was on various development assessment panels. We would have come before us rubbish developments that had absolutely zero cross-ventilation and in which some of the rooms were totally dependent on borrowed light. I would raise these concerns with the developer: 'This doesn't seem to me to be offering a very good product in terms of quality of life and affordability of operation.' They were small apartments aimed at the bottom end of the market. The developer would say, 'Don't worry about that. Don't worry about this cross-ventilation; we're putting in reverse-cycle air conditioning. They're not going to need it.' We are condoning bad design. Indeed, we are rewarding bad design. We are locking people into a lifetime of high energy costs and we are doing nothing to warn people about it. I think that is a national disgrace. We should have informed buyers. I reserve my particular contempt for Queensland, which did in fact have such measures in place. The measure was introduced in Queensland in 2010, and withdrawn in 2012 by the 'enlightened' Campbell Newman, who does not believe in the rule of law and does not believe in the science of climate change. He is a souped up, 21st-century version of Joh Bjelke-Petersen. That is a great tragedy for Queensland. I can assure members that I will be fighting to make this legislation even stronger under the Labor government which I am becoming increasingly more confident we will have in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forrest talked about business. There is so much business innovation coming out of the energy efficiency space, but we are putting the kibosh on it. There is a great new Western Australian firm, Ecocentric Energy. It is one of the firms that have not been closed down by a rampaging Department of Agriculture. This company has worked in collaboration with CSIRO and Commercialisation Australia, a project that is now being disbanded, just as Nobel Prize candidate scientists are being sacked, by this antiscience government. Ecocentric worked with Commercialisation Australia to develop a great diagnostic tool that can give very, very fine-grained reports on energy performance within a building or a manufacturing process. They have developed a thing called electrical fingerprinting and developed algorithms that are designed to recognise the energy signatures of each particular electrical device within the premises. It is a very sophisticated piece of kit. Not only did they get support under the Labor government from CSIRO, they were in the process of going to early commercialisation. We have scrapped the price on carbon and so now have no need for energy auditing. As a result, they are being wooed by the United Kingdom—I have seen submissions that have been sent to them by the UK trade office. The UK has said, 'Come over to the UK. We've got compulsory auditing provisions in the UK,'—they are also in operation in the US—'we will assist you in developing that technology.' Ecocentric are another example of the brain drain. This is happening around the world. We have shut down our carbon pricing architecture. We would have had the opportunity to be in there working with China, using the expertise we have developed over the last couple of years to work with China to develop the architecture that they are putting in place for their emissions trading scheme. We have lost that opportunity because we have destroyed the architecture. The member for Forrest went through and described a number of programs that Labor had done that perhaps had been less than optimum. There has been a lot of trial and error. I agree, we are in these new waters. There will have to be a lot of work done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I can tell you that the fundamental architecture that the Labor Party landed on and that was put in place within their second term of government is fundamentally the right architecture. We need a price on carbon. We need a decent renewable energy target and not a pretend renewable energy target; we need a decent renewable energy target that is going to drive investment into renewable energy. We needed ARENA, which was the early commercialisation phase, that allowed research and development and that early commercialisation to take place so that Australia could be a technology maker and not just a technology taker. We had the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those four things together formed the essential and fundamental architecture that we need to address climate change and to ensure that Australia has a place in this new world of the 21st century. All of that is gone. It is all demolished. At this point, we are still working on the RET. Hopefully we will get one bit saved and hopefully Mr Palmer is able to continue to at least keep ARENA on life support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at the next election I have no doubt that this will be fought to a very large extent on climate change and Australian industry. The government of today will be found to be massively wanting on both of those counts. It is a disgrace that we are not acting seriously, we do not have at our core of this concern about climate change and we do not have at our core a concern about ensuring that we are part of the technology that is being developed. As I say, forget the green and red tape. You are wrapping us up in black tape.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I rise to speak on the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014 in the second reading debate. I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's productivity is being choked by red tape, with the combined cost of administering and complying with public and private sector bureaucracy costing the nation $250 billion every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the words of Chris Richardson, the co-author of Deloitte Access Economics' latest report <span style="font-style:italic;">Get out of your own way: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nleashing productivity</span>, which was released in October. They are words that clearly depict the reality for productivity and profit margins that Australian business, industry and government is currently facing. It is also the reality that we need to work together now to stop in its tracks if we want to return our country to the level of prosperity that every Australian enjoyed a decade ago under the Howard government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report highlights exactly what this government has been saying for the past seven years: unnecessary regulation is a burden on government and it is a burden on industry. It is a burden which is costing this country's productivity margins every day it exists. Yet, it is a burden which the Labor Party insisted on increasing day in and day out for the six long years they were in government. It is a burden that, as this report states, the private sector is also imposing on themselves, through $155 billion in annual costs to administer and comply with their own rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about doing it tough in the global economic environment we are currently living in, but this report has showcased the level of hindrance we are also causing to ourselves. It is a hindrance that is costing industry both time and money. That is because instead of employees spending their time working to boost productivity, they are filling in what is often unnecessary and duplicative administrative paperwork. They are also doing this without taking the time to weigh up whether the internal rules and regulations they are abiding by are actually providing a benefit to the company or in fact achieving their objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Deloitte report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… not all compliance is bad and much of it is necessary. The issue is that many of the rules that are put in place either overcompensate or carry a heavy burden that is not justified on a risk/reward basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is evident when you look at the breakdown of the private sector's regulatory burden, with $21 billion of this total $155 billion in costs being spent on developing and administering compliance rules, while a massive $134 billion is being spent purely on compliance costs. I think members on this side of the House would agree that the coalition government is doing its part to reduce this regulatory burden; but for these measures to be effective, industry must also do theirs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014 is one of many repeal bills the coalition government has introduced into this place to reduce the impact of regulation across Australia as part of our commitment to cut $1 billion in red and green tape each year. That is because on this side of the chamber there are people with experience who understand businesses. They understand the economy and they understand that where money and time is wasted it costs Australia's economy as a whole. That whole is $2.1 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is definitely not a small number, but I am pleased to inform the House that it is the amount of unnecessary compliance costs that will now be saved in red and green tape as a result of legislation introduced by the coalition last month on our spring repeal day and in March as part of this parliament's first ever, and I must say unprecedented, autumn repeal day. It is also a number that I am pleased to advise the House is more than double our original commitment, because that is how much unnecessary regulation is currently choking industry and choking our government departments' ability to work efficiently and effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is trying to ease this regulatory burden and we are achieving our goal by working to open up our markets to new businesses and to boost productivity levels across existing industries. The coalition's commitment is not just evidenced by this $2.1 billion in compliance savings but also through our overall policy agenda to work hand-in-hand with business rather than in opposition, as seen under the former government. That is because at the end of the day our goal is the same: to drive profit for business, which in turn will boost our national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's recently announced free-trade agreements with some of our largest global export and import markets, including Japan, Korea and most recently with our largest trading partner China will play another key role in boosting our economy, creating jobs and driving higher living standards for Australians. That is because the coalition is a government that recognises that, without business productivity, this nation as a whole will fall flat. We are a government that takes the time to listen to industry and takes note of their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that in mind, I am pleased that the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill is this government's direct response to industry stakeholders' calls for regulatory burdens to be removed and administrative processes to be streamlined for building owners and lessees when applying for a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate under the provisions of the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010. The original intent of the legislation was to improve the energy efficiency of Australia's buildings, while also helping buyers and tenants to make informed decisions about efficiencies when entering into an agreement. It is legislation, I am pleased to say, that had bipartisan and stakeholder support at the time of its implementation and it continues to have that same support today. As we heard from the member for Perth, the opposition are supporting the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commercial Building Disclosure—CBD—scheme mandates that energy efficiency ratings of commercial buildings or an area of a commercial building which is more than 2,000 square metres and is used for administrative, clerical, professional or similar information-based activities be publicly available. It also creates a requirement that these buildings must have a current Building Energy Efficiency Certificate before their commercial space can be offered for lease or sale, with the certificate being valid for up to 12 months. Currently, for a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate to be issued the following information must be determined by an accredited assessor. A National Australian Built Environment Ratings System, more commonly known as NABERS, energy star rating for the building needs to be assessed. For those members who are not aware, NABERS is Australia's national rating system which measures the environmental impact or operation of a building, and it does this by assessing its energy efficiency, water usage, waste management and the indoor environmental quality of a building or tenancy and its corresponding impact on the environment. A star rating between one and six is then given to the building, with one star indicating poor energy performance and six stars being regarded by industry as market-leading performance. For a certificate to be issued, an assessment of the energy efficiency of tenancy lighting in the area of that building that is being sold or leased must also be undertaken. With lighting accounting for over 30 per cent of all energy used in commercial buildings, this is important information for prospective tenants, as their future energy bills could be significantly reduced by leasing a property that has a higher performing energy efficiency. Lastly, for a certificate to be issued, the owner or sublessee must provide general energy efficiency guidance information to any prospective owner or tenant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I am sure members can see, this is all important information when trying to determine the best value for money in the property market, particularly when identifying the impact of a low versus high energy efficiency rated building on their bills, while also helping to accelerate energy efficiency in some of Australia's largest administrative buildings. For those members who are not aware of the potential impact of a building's low versus high energy efficiency, I will clarify what this means. If a building has a high energy efficiency rating, it would therefore be expected that the business owner's or tenant's corresponding energy bill would be lower than those buildings with poor energy efficiency. This would create savings in the long term, while a higher energy efficiency would also ensure that the building's environmental impact is lower than that of a building which has poor energy efficiency. As identified in an analysis by the Department of Industry, which looked at the investment performance of high versus low NABERS energy-rated office assets from September 2008 to September 2013, higher NABERS energy-rated offices consistently outperformed low energy offices. In September 2013, this saw an annualised return of 9.8 per cent, comprising a 7.3 per cent income return and a 2.3 per cent capital growth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I am sure members would realise, buildings across Australia which require a certificate are more commonly found in CBD areas due to the prevalence of large tower buildings. In Swan, there are, however, five buildings which have been issued a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate, which, as it happens, includes the office building where my electorate office is based in Victoria Park. I am pleased to advise the House that I selected my office well. It has an energy efficiency rating which is higher than all other Swan buildings, with 4.5 stars. Although members in this place expressed bipartisan support for this scheme when it was first introduced and have done so since that time, that does not mean its processes cannot be better streamlined and reviews should not be undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, a big part of reducing unnecessary regulation and compliance costs is to look back at the policies this place has implemented and to find ways to improve them rather than taking the 'if it isn't broke don't fix it' approach, which could potentially cost government and industry billions of dollars in the long run, as identified during this government's Autumn and Spring repeal days. The amendments proposed in the bill before the House are expected to deliver improved administration to the CBD scheme while also ensuring that additional regulatory burdens that hinder industry are removed, creating an annual predicted saving of $600,000 million in compliance costs. As I mentioned earlier, commercial office buildings or an area of an office building which is more than 2,000 square metres are required to have an up-to-date Building Energy Efficiency Certificate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the CBD scheme when issuing these certificates is overall working well, stakeholders have identified a number of issues with the scheme when applying its rules and regulations in practice. The bill directly responds to these concerns by making a number of amendments to better streamline its protocols. One key amendment that will be made is the introduction of an exemption for building owners or tenants to provide an energy efficiency assessment when an offer to buy or lease that commercial property is unsolicited. Currently, the owner of a building would be required to have a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate in place before they could respond to any unsolicited or uninvited requests to sell or lease that building or an area of the building. By making this important amendment on behalf of industry, the coalition will create an estimated saving of $300,000 for businesses by removing this onerous regulatory burden. A second key amendment to the scheme also proposed in the bill will allow transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries to be excluded from disclosure obligations. Again, this amendment will lead to another $300,000 regulatory burden reduction. Thirdly, as I mentioned earlier, a certificate is issued for a maximum of 12 months and, under the scheme's current provisions, this certificate must commence on the date of issue. According to stakeholders, this is impractical for those building owners and tenants who want to exercise due diligence in maintaining or improving their energy efficiency standards. The coalition has listened to these concerns, with a third proposed amendment allowing the commencement date for a certificate to be later than the date of issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another provision that is currently required for a certificate to be issued is for standard energy efficiency guidance text to be provided to a prospective building owner or tenant. The coalition again believes this is an additional regulatory burden on industry, which could be better streamlined by instead having this information provided online in a live, interactive format.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, although the general requirement is for commercial office space that has an area of more than 2,000 square metres to have a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate, there are exceptions and exemptions to this rule. Under the scheme, newly constructed buildings, which are those under two years old, and strata title buildings are automatically exempt from the scheme. There are also a number of exemptions to the scheme's requirements which are determined on a case-by-case basis. Such exemptions include the building being used for police or security operations, if it is not possible to assign a NABERS energy rating to the building, or for vacant buildings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of exceptions to the scheme, you do not have to apply to obtain one; however, a building owner or tenant may be required to substantiate why they should be considered an exception under the scheme. Typically, exceptions can relate to the type of building, such as new buildings where a certificate of occupancy has not yet been issued, or for buildings which have completed a major refurbishment for which a certificate of occupancy was issued less than two years earlier. They can also relate to the type of transaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the scheme's current provisions, new owners and lessors are required to reapply for an exemption and possibly pay a fee even if a valid exemption is in place. Under this bill's proposed amendments, this requirement will, however, be removed to get rid of this unnecessary and costly burden on industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is important that these amendments are passed in this place to assist industry and respond to their calls for reform of the scheme, I also highlight that the Minister for Industry has commissioned an independent review of the CBD program following a direct request from the Prime Minister. This independent review is currently underway by ACIL Allen Consulting and will report to the minister by March 2015. I look forward to reviewing this report, which I am sure will give all members a greater sense of whether the scheme is continuing to meet its objectives, the scheme's level of effectiveness, and other areas where reform may be needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the stakeholders who these amendments will benefit, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I am delighted to rise today to speak, as did my Labor colleagues the members for Brand, Wills and Perth, in support of the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014 that is currently before the House. Since the establishment of the Commercial Building Disclosure, or CBD, Program, back in 2011, there have been regular stakeholder reviews.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in this bill today have been supported wholeheartedly by those stakeholder groups. In fact, these have been issues that have been raised through those regular forums that are quite rightly aimed at ensuring continuous improvement of the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes require legislative amendments to the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010, the BEED Act, and associated legislative instruments, including the Building Energy Efficiency Regulations and Determinations. The act was created following significant consultation with industry—specifically, the Green Building Council of Australia, the Energy Efficiency Council and the Clean Energy Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I wish to reaffirm Labor's longstanding commitment to energy conservation and efficiency. Energy efficiency represents one of the fastest-growing and cheapest ways that we can reduce our nation's greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the International Energy Agency's <span style="font-style:italic;">Energy efficiency market report 2014</span> found that energy efficiency is indeed the world's 'first fuel'. The research found that energy efficiency improvements in 11 countries, including Australia, delivered more—that is right: more—capacity than any other source of energy. That is remarkable—more energy from conservation than from burning oil, coal or gas. Energy efficiency saved those 11 countries some 56 exajoules of energy in 2012, which was more than the final energy delivered by oil, which was some 50 exajoules; electricity, at 23 exajoules; or natural gas, at 20 exajoules. It is also more than the total energy consumption of the European Union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Newcastle is lucky enough to be home to some of the world's leaders in energy efficiency research. Scientists at the University of Newcastle's Institute for Energy and Resources, otherwise known as NIER, and scientists at the CSIRO Energy Centre have been at the centre of developments that are changing the way that we use, store and, indeed, generate energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to briefly turn to some of the work being done at the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources. Their research is based on four key areas. The first is resource productivity and efficiency: looking for solutions to problems facing our minerals, gas and water resource sectors. They also examine energy technologies and utilisation, an area that is driven by economic and environmental challenges with the goal of increasing efficiencies and reducing, of course, greenhouse gases. The third key area for NIER is around advanced materials for energy applications—looking at the significant potential for the next generation of low-cost, sustainable energy applications. And the final area of study that NIER's researchers are great specialists at is land use, social impacts and sustainability, which focuses on the balance between the environment, community and economic activity within energy and resource intensive regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could talk at length—for much of this debate—on some of the fantastic work that is being done by the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources; however, I would like to use this opportunity now to acknowledge one of the more recent successes of their researchers. Last month, Professor Behdad Moghtaderi was awarded the Renewable Energy Innovation Award at the New South Wales Science and Engineering Awards for his GRANEX heat engine invention. The engine turns low-grade heat resources that may not otherwise be viably usable into emissions-free electricity. It can be applied to a range of diverse heat sources, including renewable energy, process industries, transport systems and commercial and residential buildings. It is research that will indeed be a game changer for this nation, and I am particularly delighted that NIER its researchers have been recognised for the lead role they have taken in that area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to turn to some of the work being developed at the CSIRO Energy Centre in Newcastle. Like NIER, the listing of achievements by the CSIRO Energy Centre would take much more time than we have here today to speak on this bill, but I would like to note that the CSIRO facility, the actual physical space, where much of that groundbreaking work has been conducted, is at the forefront of an energy efficiency build in Australia and is certainly worthy of being noted in this debate. The CSIRO Energy Centre, which opened in Newcastle in 2003, set a new benchmark in terms of ecologically sustainable design, showcasing innovative energy generation approaches, building demand reduction and supply options. They conserve energy through the building's orientation and layout, the construction materials and building management systems. They generate energy on-site through a 115 kilowatt photovoltaic system and a 120 kilowatt gas-fired microturbine co-generation system, and house two high-concentration solar thermal tower arrays capable of 500 kilowatts and one megawatt thermal output respectively. The Newcastle CSIRO Energy Centre most definitely practise what they preach. The work of both NIER and CSIRO showcase what can be achieved here in Australia with proper funding and investment into education and resources and important capital works and investment programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we are discussing energy efficiency in this chamber, it would be remiss of me not to mention the renewable energy target. Until this government came to power, the renewable energy target, or RET as it is known, enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation some 13 years ago under the then Howard Liberal government. It is something that the Prime Minister promised he would not change if elected—but we are regularly reminded, however, that keeping promises is not one of the Prime Minister's strongest points. But keeping the RET was indeed a promise he clearly made. The government specifically committed to the 41,000 gigawatt-hour target and that there would be no changes to the arrangements in the rooftop solar industry, both household and commercial. The crazy thing is that even the Prime Minister's own hand-picked panel set out to review and possibly wind back the RET confirmed that on every possible indicator the RET works and it should be kept. The RET helped drive our nation as a leader in renewable energy technology and use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came to government in 2007, there were 7,400 houses across the entire country that had rooftop solar. By the time we left, there were 1.3 million, and that is still growing by 3,000 every month. Unfortunately it is not growing as quickly as it would be if there were not some uncertainty, which this government has now brought through with its review of the RET, but the growth is still strong. Labor's position remains to defend the renewable energy target. It is working. It lowers power prices, lowers carbon pollution and supports an industry that employs thousands of Australians. The RET is an integral part of Australia's energy economy and our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill is an important part of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commercial building sector is responsible for around 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions and this figure is rising. The importance of energy efficiency in our commercial buildings is as critical now as ever. Energy efficiency, as I said, represents one of the fastest and cheapest ways that we can reduce our nation's greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of its effectiveness to streamline the efficacy of the Commercial Building Disclosure Program, the bill before us is an important step in the right direction. As I mentioned, stakeholders support the changes that are proposed in this bill but, notwithstanding the support for those changes, there is a great deal of scepticism about the yet to be published commercial building disclosure, or CBD, review. The CBD is a national program designed to improve the energy efficiency of Australia's office buildings as part of the National Strategy on Energy Efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010 established a legal requirement for owners of large commercial office buildings to obtain energy efficiency information for their building and to disclose it to prospective purchasers and lessees. It also required head tenants who are subletting office space to disclose this information. The energy efficiency information disclosed is in the form of a building energy efficiency certificate. The certificate includes a star rating of the building's energy efficiency, an assessment of tenancy lighting and additional guidance on how the energy efficiency of the office might be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend organisations which are setting a good example for others to follow in energy efficiency, such as the Hunter Water Corporation, in my electorate, which has a 4.5-star rating of its head office in Newcastle's Honeysuckle Precinct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are the energy efficiency measures good for the environment; they are also economically beneficial for building owners. It is now well documented that buildings with an environmental rating deliver better returns and so the CBD program is helping to deliver increased value in the property market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Building </span><span style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span style="font-style:italic;">etter </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eturns</span> report 2011 found that green-star rated buildings deliver a 12 per cent green premium in value and a five per cent premium in rent, compared to non-rated buildings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Credible energy efficiency information helps parties to make better informed decisions and to take full account of the economic costs and environmental impacts associated with operating the buildings they are intending to purchase or lease. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the second year of full mandatory disclosure, from 1 November 2012 to 1 November 2013, the CBD program issued 1,081 building energy efficiency certificates and 1,106 tenancy light assessments. These initiatives are making a difference. This bill will certainly assist in terms of tidying up a number of housekeeping measures that, as I have said, stakeholders have brought to our attention for continuous improvement of this program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do share, as outlined by the member for Brand, Labor's concerns around the future of the CBD program and the potential for this ongoing review to be an effective cover for its abolition. That would be a retrograde step for Australia and, indeed, it is to be avoided at all costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the objectives of this bill and the efficiencies and streamlining of processes that will be achieved by its measures, but we give a warning about the review of the CBD.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of this bill, the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014, which aims to streamline the administrative processes of the Commercial Building Disclosure program and, in so doing, address the concerns of stakeholders about reducing the regulatory burden on industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill fits with the coalition's plan to reduce red tape and to make it easier for businesses to comply with commercial building disclosure regulations. The implementation of this bill will result in significant savings for businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amending legislation will also ensure that businesses will encounter a smaller administrative burden and less red tape when dealing with compliance relating to energy efficiency regulations. The Prime Minister has noted: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… lower taxes, less red tape, and more incentives to work harder and smarter are the key to a stronger economy and better services.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to be able to state that the coalition is delivering on its promises to cut red tape and make it easier for business to comply with government regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the commercial building sector is responsible for about 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions and the coalition recognises that tackling building energy efficiency is one of the quickest and most cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in so doing, it is important to ensure that the burden on business is not overly excessive and unreasonable, particularly in conducting transactions which are already significantly complex and time consuming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> This amending legislation aims to improve the Commercial Building Disclosure program, created under the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010, the BEED Act, with the purpose of allowing businesses to have greater flexibility with applications for building energy efficiency certificates. The bill also ensures that certain businesses can deal with the streamlined administrative process when complying with the Commercial Building Disclosure program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act aims to ensure that credible and meaningful energy efficiency information is given to prospective purchasers and lessees of large commercial office space. The act requires energy efficiency information to be disclosed in most cases, when commercial office space of 2,000 square metres or more is offered for sale or lease, in order to allow purchasers or lessees to make more informed decisions and take a more complete account of the economic costs and environmental impacts associated with the operation of commercial premises which they are intending to purchase or lease. However, under the current regulatory framework, concerns have arisen from various stakeholders about the effectiveness of the program in achieving its goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a proven track record of engaging with industry and, in so doing, has listened to concerns and acted to ensure that we make the process of conducting compliance more streamlined and efficient for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amending legislation will make a number of changes in order to facilitate this. Firstly, it will provide exemptions to building owners who receive unsolicited offers for the sale or lease of their office space. Under the present legislation businesses are compelled to provide building energy efficiency certificates when unsolicited offers are made for a potential lease or purchase of any commercial property that falls under the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will reduce the regulatory burden on industry, by providing a time-limited exemption from the mandatory disclosure requirements for the two parties involved in a negotiation started by an unsolicited offer. Providing for an exemption in this instance will reduce the need for businesses to provide untimely building energy efficiency certificates and will lead to an estimated $0.3 million reduction of regulatory burden on businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the amending legislation will provide for wholly-owned subsidiaries to be excluded from disclosure obligations when entering into transactions with a parent entity. The effect of this change is to exclude these non-market transactions from the requirements of mandatory disclosure which will, in turn, reduce the burden on industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the present legislation aims to create a more informed marketplace with regard to transactions involving large commercial premises, mandating that wholly-owned subsidiaries transacting with parent entities be compelled to comply with the Commercial Building Disclosure program does not serve to achieve this and simply adds unnecessary complexity to already elaborate transactions.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Excluding these non-market transactions from the disclosure regime will lead to a further estimated $0.3 million reduction of regulatory burden on businesses. Combined with the exemptions to businesses which receive unsolicited offers from potential lessors and buyers, these measures will see a $0.6 million reduction in regulatory burden on business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to addressing these issues, the amendment will also address the ambiguity in the Building Energy Efficiency Act in relation to the status of assessments undertaken by assessors accredited under the National Australian Built Environment Ratings System. At present, a number of NABERS accredited assessors are not accredited under the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act. This means there is significant ambiguity for businesses around the status of accreditations completed by NABERS accredited assessors. In order to address this issue the amendment will confer additional functions on auditing authorities such as NABERS allowing them to directly provide or approve ratings used in building energy efficiency certificates which are required for compliance with the Commercial Building Disclosure Regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment will also confer two new functions on appointed auditors when conducting assessments of affected commercial property. Assessors will now be allowed to conduct audits of both energy efficiency ratings and lighting energy efficiency assessments provided or approved by auditing authorities such as NABERS for the purposes of applying for building energy efficiency certificates. The bill also aims to allow auditors to conduct audits of applications for exemptions under section 17 of the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act. This has the practical effect of enabling auditing under the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act of NABERS energy efficiency ratings which are conducted by the significant number of NABERS accredited assessors who have not been accredited under the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act up until now. In clarifying the status of assessments that up until now may not have been made by assessors accredited under the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act, the coalition will give certainty and assurance to businesses attempting to comply with the CBD regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces the concept of having both an issue day and a start day which is later than the issue day. At present, there is no distinction between the day a building energy efficiency certificate is issued and the day that it starts to take effect. This will provide greater flexibility for businesses wishing to proactively maintain current building energy efficiency certificates for their property portfolios. The changes will also allow for a new building energy efficiency certificate to be issued in advance of the expiry of a current building energy efficiency certificate and for the new certificate to commence once the current certificates expires, creating a more efficient way for business to ensure that the certificates are up to date and compliant for their entire portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the act will be amended to allow for variations or revocations of an exemption to be given by the secretary of the department by way of written notice to a person with an interest in the commercial building or area to be affected. In doing so, the amendment will serve to remove the need for new owners and lessors to reapply or pay the application fee for a fresh exemption as if there is already a valid one in place for a building. This measure will make it easier for new owners and lessors to comply with the act's regulations and save them money by waiving the associated fee which under the act as it presently stands is required to accompany any application for a variation. The amendment will also ensure that the requirement for six pages of standard energy efficiency guidance text on the building energy efficiency certificate BEECH is removed. Instead, live and interactive online information about improving energy efficiency for office buildings will be provided in its place, thereby reducing the amount of paperwork that business needs to wade through in regulatory compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By streamlining the work done by assessors accredited under the NABERS program, by making the process of applying for exemption more efficient and by reducing the overall burden businesses have in complying with regulations, the government has taken genuine steps to cut unnecessary red tape. In actively dismantling excessive regulatory burden, the government has not lost sight of the very real need to assist the commercial building sector to seek market based incentives to reform energy efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have mentioned previously, the amendments in this act demonstrate the government's clear commitment to taking into account the concerns of various stakeholders and reduce the regulatory burden on industry. At the previous election the Australian community made it clear that they wished to see a government taking action on these issues which stifle businesses and constrain growth. We have a clear mandate to lessen the regulatory burden and cut unnecessary red tape. This bill is one of the many important steps the coalition is taking to help businesses to facilitate growth. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                    </a>  I will take that interjection! This legislation basically deals with the commercial building sector. It is important that good governments understand the role that the commercial building sector plays in terms of contributing to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. I am informed that they contribute about 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions—and, unfortunately, this figure is rising. However, the good news is that energy efficiency represents one of the fastest and cheapest ways we can reduce our nation's greenhouse gas emissions. That is what the Howard government was committed to in the lead-up to the 2007 election, and obviously the Rudd government—and it continued under the Gillard government. We believe that this nation must act. As a Queenslander, coming from the state which is arguably the worst per capita emitter in the world—there is some argument about Qatar—I understand the need to do more. It is not enough to just let things continue unabated. This legislation reflects that commitment of good government to pull whatever levers are possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill, introduced in 2010, established a legal requirement for owners of large commercial office buildings to obtain energy efficiency information for their building and disclose that information to prospective purchasers and lessees—people moving into the building. The energy efficiency information disclosed is in the form of a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate—a BEEC. This includes a star rating of the building's energy efficiency, an assessment of tenancy lighting and additional guidance on how the energy efficiency of the office may be improved. It is a sensible bit of information—information that all good people purchasing a building would track down anyway, but it is creating the culture that this is the norm, that this is the standard bit of information that should be available to people when they purchase a building.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting that when Labor brought in this legislation two property industry reports showed that buildings with the higher energy efficiency ratings are actually commanding better returns in the marketplace. People are obviously prepared to pay more for the tenancies and the buildings because of this higher star rating. And switching to efficient lighting can cut tenants' lighting bills by 30 to 60 per cent. So, it makes good sense for commercial buildings to disclose as much information as possible and then to create the culture that this is the norm. And those stars are something to brag about. If you are a landlord who has a property portfolio and people want with good conscience to invest in a property portfolio, you can say, 'We only own buildings that have these star ratings.' It makes good commercial sense, it makes good environmental sense, and that is why Labor introduced this legislation and it has been largely supported by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment bill in front of the chamber now, proposed by the government, is largely a housekeeping measure in response to changes that have been proposed in stakeholder forums, and these changes will reduce red tape. Obviously when the program was brought in it started to achieve its outcomes, but we need to tidy up a few things. The changes before the chamber include providing exemptions to building owners who receive unsolicited offers for the sale or lease of their office space, and this will lead to a suggested $300,000 reduction in regulatory burden. It will also allow transactions between wholly owned subsidiaries to be excluded from the disclosure obligations. So, rather than running around and tracking down information when an entity is largely giving it to itself, there is a reduction in red tape. It also addresses ambiguity in the BEED Act in relation to the status of assessments undertaken by assessors accredited under the National Australian Built Environment Rating System program but not accredited under the CBD program. So, it is largely technical, but it makes sense to streamline this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also introduce the ability to determine a commencement date for a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate which is later than the actual date of issue. This will provide greater flexibility for businesses wishing to proactively maintain their current BEECs for their property portfolio. It will remove the need for new owners and lessors to reapply or pay the application fee for fresh exemptions if there is an existing one in place for a building and remove the requirement for six pages of standard energy efficiency guidance text on the Building Energy Efficiency Certificate, as well as provide live and interactive online information about improving energy efficiency for office buildings instead. It makes sense to get rid of paperwork if the whole intent of the legislation is to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Industry has appointed Allen Consulting to undertake an independent review with the purpose of assessing the program's objectives, the effectiveness of the program in promoting energy efficiency and its interaction with the proposed Emissions Reduction Fund. This needs to be seen in the context of the Direct Action climate change policy embraced by the Abbott government. That is a $2.55 billion program, or $2,550 million, committed to reducing Australia's emissions. Let us put that in context. That is about $110 for every man, woman and child, yet this program that they are committed to—that the so-called environment minister is committed to, that the Prime Minister is committed to—cannot find a friend who believes it will actually do anything effective. It is effectively giving money to polluters. That is the policy that the government has embraced. We actually saw the Prime Minister rule out ever introducing an emissions trading scheme, which is, as every economist knows, the best and quickest way to obtain a price on a product.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we have the party of Menzies abolishing markets, saying that we will never have a market for something that is going to cause harm to our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren, and causing harm to farmers right now. The Prime Minister has said—</span>

                    </a>  I will take that interjection from the member for Tangney, because remember your policy, the very policy that your party has embraced, is to combat climate change. So, come in spinner! I am looking forward to your contribution on this, because it is always out there. Your contributions are almost at Mars when it comes to climate change. So, the member's party has committed to spend $110 for every man, woman and child in Australia to combat climate change. But we cannot see how it will work. The real risk is that you give some polluters money to not pollute, but then other polluters can step up—because there is no cap on what Australia's emissions could be—and just be able to increase their emissions. There is no cop on the beat, there is no market mechanism to ensure that that does not happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are going to have every man, every woman and every child in Australia paying $110, all for a mirage. I think the member for Fairfax extracted out of this government a commitment to provide a report on whether there should be emissions trading. They paid $2.55 billion for this report, but the Prime Minister has said, 'We will ignore that report'. So everyone in this chamber should take out $110 and just give it to the environment minister and say, 'Don't worry about the report, because you're just going to waste that money.'</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw at the G20 meeting that Australia is not in step with the rest of the developed world. We saw China and the United States embrace action on climate change. We have seen India, which is buying a little bit of coal from Queensland, sidestepping that whole coal-fired power generation stage—in terms of bringing those hundreds of millions of people in the rural areas out of poverty—and, instead, they are going to go into solar and the other renewables.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that Australia had a golden opportunity, under the Labor government in the 42nd and 43rd parliaments, to be ready for a carbon-constrained global economy. Instead, we have lost that opportunity. Those billions of dollars of infrastructure investment in renewable energy have now evaporated and gone to other places—gone to sunnier places, gone too windier places than Australia. Instead, we have a government that fundamentally does not believe its own policy. That weathervane of a Prime Minister is prepared to sacrifice $2.55 billion for something that he actually, one day or another, does not believe in.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill, is part of that Labor legacy of changing the culture. I saw it in Brisbane during the droughts in the early part of the noughties, where the dams in Brisbane were down to nearly 16 to 17 per cent water and suddenly Brisbane, a subtropical city, changed its water consumption patterns all but overnight. I have seen cultures change quickly, and that is what was happening under the Labor government in terms of responding to climate change. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are obviously the party of jobs. We are not the magic-happens, crystal-hugging party that does not believe in jobs. We are the party of jobs. We wanted Australia to transition in a realistic way so that we could look after the jobs in the mining sector, look after the jobs in manufacturing and the like and end up with jobs in the long term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where were the jobs being created under Labor? They were in the renewable energy sector. We have had nearly 71,000 more unemployed people under this government since they came in last year. They do not understand jobs and, worse than that, they do not understand the future, the challenges that are coming our way. We know that there are some revenue collapse issues coming our way, and all the braying of those people that occupy the backbenches up there in the third 15 corner are not going to change that reality. Australia needs to be prepared for a carbon-constrained future—that is the reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is not something for Labor to be concerned about; however, obviously the review that is coming might be something that we need to look at. Under Labor, we did flag that eventually this model of providing certificates for buildings would turn into a cost-recovery model. That was something flagged by the Labor government when it was announced, because the program is only funded for five years. However, this is an opportunity for the government to show its leadership—not mislead, leadership—and make sure that this program continues. Because it is slowly changing the culture, and it will then flow out into households so that when people buy their home, buy their building, rent their building, rent their home, they will be saying, 'What are the long-term costs associated with this?' Because there are many things that can be done early. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is another reason why this Direct Action policy will not work. That is because almost all of the low-hanging fruit has gone. That is why this $2.55 billion white elephant of a policy is not going to achieve the goals that they are talking about. Ken Henry suggested that it could cost up to $4 to $5 billion per year between now and 2020 just to get to the government's five per cent reduction target. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is going to cost even more taxpayers' dollars to achieve the target, or the Prime Minister will have to give up on his attempt to reduce Australia's carbon pollution, and that would make us even more of a pariah. Canada is happy to commit the world environment fund so that Canada gets it. The Prime Minister's only friend at G20, when it came to climate change, Canadian Prime Minister Harper, still understood that climate change is real. You might have a few people that scoff and surf the dark edges of the internet for some crackpot scientists wearing tinfoil hats that support their programs, but that is not the reality of the CSIRO and the mainstream science.

With reduced use comes reduced costs. That is a real win for business. With this amendment bill we have the opportunity to streamline administration and reduce the regulatory burden on business. This amendment, a savings multiplier, is necessary and called for by the community. I have spoken before on the importance of keeping the regulatory burden subdued. Key to this is focusing on regulatory amendments that help keep compliance costs down. Compliance costs are a wet blanket on the flame of free enterprise and competitive business. Overregulation is the 'hungry, hungry hippo' of the economy. Unlike the lovable children's board game, overregulation leaves everyone the poorer—the people, the economy, the nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Today, thousands of Australians celebrate International Day of People with Disability. I want to share the inspirational story of Anna Russ. Anna has cerebral palsy and has limited ability to move her arms. She has always had a passion for art, but her disability meant that her capacity to participate in the creative arts was limited. All this changed when Anna was given access to an iPad at Araluen, a disability support service in my electorate of Jagajaga. For the first time, the artistic expression that had been locked in Anna's mind was unleashed. A flurry of artistic expression poured from Anna's mind onto the digital canvas. Today Anna's paintings are reproduced from the iPad onto metal and sold at galleries across Melbourne. I congratulate Araluen for their Imagining Better program that explores opportunities for people with disability to use technology.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme for this year's International Day of People with Disability is Sustainable Development: The Promise of Technology. Anna's story provides us with a perfect example of how technology is enabling people with disability to be defined not by their disability but by their skills and their ability to contribute so much to our society. Happy International Day of People with Disability to Anna Russ and to all Australians.</span>

Today is the official start of a wide-ranging calendar of events, including a church service, a photographic exhibition, a reunion event and the screening of a new ABC documentary called <span style="font-style:italic;">Blown Away</span>. On December 5, Darwin's Christmas tree lights will be switched on to honour Tracy's victims and on Christmas Eve they will be dimmed in memoriam. Other community events include a fish and chips night at Nightcliff on December 22, a get together at East Point on Christmas Eve, a commemorative service hosted by the Salvation Army and a survival breakfast to be held on Christmas Day.</span>

While many lives were lost and spirits were broken, Darwin emerged through the rubble and today exists as a modern metropolis and, if I may say so, is leading the way in developing northern Australia. Darwin is like the phoenix, rising from the ashes, becoming bigger and better and more beautiful.</span>

Luke rode all the way to give me this petition, signed by 11,000 people, as part of the National Stroke Foundation's Fight Stroke campaign. It was not easy, but it was nothing compared to what Luke has been through. A year and a half ago, at the age of just 20, Luke had a stroke. It was triggered by a plane trip where he got deep vein thrombosis.</span>

Gamma Raycing placed second in the world, competing against 300 students from 23 countries. This year's result continues Australia's dominance of podium positions in the international competition.

It is a great testament to the ingenuity, creativity and hard work of our local students and teachers. I was encouraged to see the Macarthur community rally around Gamma Raycing, with a fundraiser at Tabcorp Park Menangle raising $22,000 to help get the team to Abu Dhabi, along with sponsorships from the Defence Material Organisation, TAFE SWSi, MWLP, Townsend Signs and the Daystar Foundation, along with many local Macarthur businesses, organisations and individuals which are too many to name.</span>

Made up almost entirely of volunteers, the SES consists of 229 units throughout New South Wales, comprising approximately 10,000 volunteer members. I like to describe the trusty orange overalls as our community's insurance policy. When Mother Nature reminds us of her power, it is the SES volunteers who clean up and put us back on our feet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, Randwick Botany SES volunteers completed 7,500 hours of training and operations and 2,000 hours attending community events, including the White Ribbon Walk, traffic control and traffic management. This year they have responded to 274 calls for assistance, two thirds of which were in the last six weeks, due to two large storms. Over the big storm period, they did five flood rescues around the Sydney Airport region, saving people from dangerous floodwaters. Lots of trees were removed and lots of roofs were repaired. They are there to do anything, 24/7.</span>

I would also like to pay particular tribute to Barry Askew, who retired after 23 years of service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I am very pleased that the federal government's Long Day Care Professional Development Program will support 44 long-day-care services in Durack to help with upskilling their educators and to meet the outcomes of the National Quality Framework. Recently I visited Bernice McLeod Early Learning Centre in Exmouth, which has 24 places. The four excited staff members were thrilled to be notified of the program funding and on learning the news began a training needs analysis to develop individual work plans. Director Caroline McGarry was sponsored on a 457 visa in 2012 and has worked for the service in Paraburdoo and now in Exmouth. Kim Grant, the service's regional manager, visits Exmouth monthly to provide support and supervision. Kim overseas other services that all receive this funding as well, including centres in Derby, Pannawonica, Onslow and Port Hedland. Bernice McLeod received an Exceeding rating in the national assessment. The service excelled in the areas of relationships with children and collaborative partnerships with families and communities. Bernice McLeod is proud to be part of the Exmouth community and works with the school, toy library and local playgroups. The staff are looking forward to building on their professional development and training as a result of the federal funding. I am particularly delighted they have received this funding and know that they will use the money wisely to build their skills and careers for the benefit of the children of Exmouth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Yesterday, the Treasurer said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... there would not have been any free trade agreements if we hadn't of made the hard decisions about industry assistance at the beginning of the year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer needs to explain what he meant by his comments. Are they an admission that the Abbott government abandoned the Australian auto manufacturing industry in order to secure free trade agreements? Is that also why in December last year the Treasurer hounded GMH out of Australia? Indeed, both Toyota and GMH cited free trade agreements as factors in their closures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer also said yesterday that there was insufficient time  to allow for an open tender for the building of Australia's future submarines. This claim does not withstand scrutiny and has been refuted by several well informed sources. Before the election, Defence Minister Johnston said: 'The coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide.' There is now a perception that that commitment was reneged on in order to secure a free trade agreement with Japan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Auto manufacturing and defence manufacturing both underpin much of Australia's multi-billion-dollar manufacturing sector, and both are vital to the South Australian economy. It is becoming clearer by the day that the Abbott government has sacrificed Australia's auto and defence industries, tens of thousands of Australians employed by those sectors, and its own defence and industry ministers in order to rush through free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Forde, we have some terrific retail shopping centres, with everything anyone could possibly need for Christmas. They can all be sourced locally—from Christmas hams through to gifts for family and friends. I am committed to supporting small and local business across the Forde electorate, because small business and family enterprise are the economic lifeblood of our communities, and the coalition wants to see them prosper.</span>

Sadly, some 520,000 jobs were lost in small business under the previous Labor government, and we, as a government, are now focussed on arresting this decline and turning these numbers around.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage everybody to shop locally with our small businesses. Support them, because they are the ones that employ your kids or maybe even employ you. That is the best way we can ensure the economic success and growth of our local communities. Get out and about amongst your local shopping strips, businesses and service providers and find out what great value there is, not just for your wallet but also for the health and economic vitality of our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a number of years, peace and stability has occurred in this area through the parties observing the guidelines established under the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which they signed onto in 2002. However, more recently, stability in the region has been threatened following the deployment of a Chinese oil rig in the vicinity of the Spratly and Paracel Islands. Although the drilling rig has now been removed, clearly stability in the South China Sea has been impacted. Because of this, the VCA has compiled a petition containing more than 11,000 signatures opposing the provocative and unilateral actions in these disputed areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, Australia shares a common interest with members of the international community in maintaining peace and civility in the region. Threats and the use of force by any country involved in the dispute are neither warranted nor acceptable. For that reason, I have lodged a notice of motion calling on the Australian government to play a role in encouraging parties to the dispute to resolve their claims through peaceful means and in accordance with international law.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  There is good news in the community of Casino today. The Casino Drill Hall was scheduled to be sold by auction on 10 December, next week.  I can announce to those here today, and to the community of Casino, that that sales process next week has been cancelled and the sale delayed for at least six months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Casino Drill Hall has a longstanding historical and cultural value to the town of Casino. In 2008 it was deemed to be surplus to Defence requirements. It was offered, in 2010, to the Richmond Valley Council to purchase—but, for different reasons, they did not want it. The Defence department since that time has been going through a process to sell it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community at large only became aware of this process about four or five weeks ago, when the auction signs went up for this to be sold. I went to a public meeting at the RSM Club in Casino two weeks ago. The will of that meeting was—overwhelmingly—that they wanted the sale process to be delayed. They wanted more community consultation and they wanted the time to come up with alternatives for this. I can announce with great joy the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence yesterday informed me that he has instructed the Department of Defence to defer the sale for six months, at least.</span>

This petition so far has over 72,000 signatures. Those signatures have been collected in just seven weeks. The petition is still open for members of the public to get on board.</span>

It was inspired by the Monster Petition tabled in Victoria in 1891, which collected 30,000 signatures and requested the vote for women.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The petition requests the House build a safe climate future by enacting immediate and deep reductions to Australia's carbon emissions. It is a very important petition. The people who are behind it are a dozen Australian women. They say on their website that they are worried about the future of Australia's children, land and seas and that they have come together to provide a mechanism for people across our country to give a collective voice to their concern. The petition is still open and I encourage all others who feel as these great women do to get online and sign up.</span>

A fortnight ago Lakeside Joondalup shopping centre opened its $300 million expansion, becoming the largest shopping centre in Western Australia. The redevelopment increases Lakeside's total floor area from 71,000 to 96,000 square metres. This surpasses Westfield Carousel, which was previously WA's biggest shopping centre.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lakeside Joondalup has a vast selection of shopping choices, with approximately 320 retailers. It includes major national supermarket and department store chains as well as more than 240 specialty stores, new restaurants and over 5,000 car-parking bays. The centrepiece of the redevelopment is the new 12,000 square metre Myer department store.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Business and consumer confidence received a substantial boost from the investment by Lend Lease, adding to local employment self-sufficiency within the region. Currently, over 75 per cent of employed residents commute to work out of the city of Joondalup, each day, adding to traffic congestion on the Mitchell Freeway. The economic development activity and local employment opportunities created by this landmark project are set to continue with many more major developments planned in central Joondalup.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Politics can be unfair and it can be cruel, as it has been for my friend Jennifer Kanis, who yesterday conceded defeat in the state seat of Melbourne. She did so with a characteristic grace. Sadly, she could not overcome the weight of money and resources thrown against this progressive woman by those indifferent to the concerns of those who rely on government for dignified and secure lives. She will be missed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her by-election victory was extraordinary and inspirational. In many ways, it set up Saturday's result for Labor in Victoria. As a member of parliament she built on this win, in the community and in the parliament. Having been a great teacher and a much better lawyer than me, she excelled as a representative of the place she lives in and loves. I am so proud to know Jen and call her my friend. Even yesterday, her thoughts were with others, not for herself. Jen and her family—husband Davydd and son Blake—are in the thoughts of all of us in the Victorian Labor Party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think also today of her wonderful staff—Jane Lawless, Rose Iser, Brenton Baldwin and Claire Watson, and of all those who worked so hard for Labor in Melbourne. They will be feeling bruised and disappointed. But let me say this to all of them: you should also be proud of all you did to make real change in Victoria. I am so proud of you and of your contributions. Jen, your qualities are needed in public life. I hope that in good time—in your time—you choose to return to it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  As this will be the last time I address the Australian parliament in 2014, I wish to remind the Australian people—and particularly those who live in the Wimmera Mallee and Mildura regions—of the Christmas message. At Christmas time we celebrate the birth of baby Jesus, whose words we use every sitting day at parliament, when the members of parliament recite in this chamber the Lord's Prayer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we reflect on the Christmas story, with a child born of poor, humble beginnings, it reminds us of those who have no shelter over Christmas. We also reflect on how the angels appeared to shepherds working night shift. Angels never appeared to politicians or the wealthy, only to the shift workers and farmers. As a member who represents workers and farmers, I am reminded that everyday people are the most important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The angels' message of peace on earth seems to struggle to reconcile with human history. Peace on earth would save the Australian Defence budget $28 billion and yet, in 2014, the world somehow seems a more dangerous place. Australian forces still participate in conflicts around the world in order to defend the defenceless. The angels' message does point to the internal peace that can be found in the human heart. Ultimately, it is only when the peace-loving heart of God aligns with the hearts of mankind that we can see peace on earth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Christmas, enjoy some good Aussie food, enjoy some time with loved ones and remember the hope, peace and eternal truth of the Christmas story. Merry Christmas, Australia!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise today to note recent reports of sexual and physical violence taking place in institutions across the country against women with disabilities. Last week <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> horrified Australians with stories of women who had been physically and sexually abused by those who had been entrusted to care for them. What is most concerning is that these stories do not appear to be unusual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Advocacy group Women with Disabilities Australia estimates that over 70 per cent of women with disabilities have been victims of violent sexual encounters. Pervasive and destructive abuse of this kind requires a serious response from government. That is why I welcome reports that the newly elected Andrews Labor government in Victoria will open an inquiry into Victoria's disability care system. However, all Australians who have suffered abuse of this kind deserve justice. As such, I also echo calls by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for disability reform to establish an independent investigation into these allegations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On International Day of People with Disability, I would like to acknowledge the important voices in my community who fight for the rights of those with disabilities by raising issues of this kind. One of those women in my community is Millie Parker. She is tireless in fighting for the interests of people with disabilities and making sure that their voices are heard. In the chamber today, I honour all her good work. I know that she will continue to be an effective advocate in my community—indeed, in all of our communities—into the future for people with disabilities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I have previously shared with the parliament the work of the Share the Love, a Dobell based charity that assists young mums by providing essential needs for their young children. I am pleased to advise the House that Kristy Chidgey, director of Share the Love, was recently recognised as the 2014 NRMA Volunteer of the Year. Kristy is the founder of Share the Love, which is the realisation of a vision shared by Kristy, Sarah Wilson and Christin Davis to establish an organisation to help young mums and young families in need. Share the Love assists these families with anything from nappies to nursery furniture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This award is fitting recognition for Kristy and the Share the Love founders whose hard work and dedication has seen Share the Love grow from operating out of Kristy's garage to now based in commercial premises at Gorokan. Upon receiving the award, Kristy said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's nice to be recognised, and to have the NRMA acknowledge what we do is pretty cool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The award will see Share the Love receive $5,000, which will provide much needed support to young mums on the Central Coast. Share the Love have used some of this award money to purchase equipment such as prams and cot mattresses, including a specialty pram for a mum who recently gave birth to a premature baby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kristy is also hoping to use some of the funds to assemble and distribute back-to-school kits for disadvantaged families. In parliament, I am extremely proud to acknowledge Kristy's work and know that her commitment to community is making Dobell a much better place to live. Congratulations to Kristy and Share the Love.</span>

Today, I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have supported me throughout 2014, and that is my fantastic team. I have been blessed to have been surrounded by a great group of people who work hard and passionately behind the scenes. Thank you to my staff: Madeleine Firth, John Hannoush, Alicia Turner, Jill Peterson, Claire Wheaton and Victoria Robertson. I thank my interns and work experience students: Eugenia Stuart, Miriam Huber, James Perkins, Jasmin Irwin, Bowen Xia, Matilda Sandell and Ruby Whalan. And last, but not least, I thank my volunteers, particularly Llois Cutts, Helen De Landre, Emily McIntosh, Margaret Watt, Lesley McGrane, Anneke Meehl, Eric Topp and Karl Maftoum. To everyone on my team, your help has enabled me to represent and advocate for the people of Canberra, which is a wonderful honour for all of us. Your hard work has helped many in the community.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  This afternoon I rise to speak of a great Gladstone entrepreneur and character, Pieter Groen-In't-Woud, who sadly passed away on 20 November. On Monday, I had the honour of attending his funeral, along with many others whom this man had touched with his unique personality. Whilst Pieter was only 69, he had led a full life. Listening to the various speakers on Monday, he appears to have fitted two lifetimes into one. Pieter was known for his passion for life, hard work and ingenuity. His passion for his work was unbelievable. Most importantly, his love for his wife Barbara and children, Saskia, Marya and Anthony, and their families was exceptional. His generosity was above and beyond reproach. Whether it was time or money, he was always had plenty to give. Pieter's final farewell was attended by many who had travelled from overseas and others travelled from all around Australia. It shows the mark of a sincere, true man when so many people travelled so far to say goodbye to a true gentleman. To finish, I would like to give a quote from Pieter himself—and he had quite a few:</span>

Bendigo is the second-biggest regional city in Victoria and again has been left off the map. What is with this government that they do not understand that so much of our lives is on the line right now and Bendigo is being left behind the digital divide. Minister Malcolm Turnbull was in Bendigo last year and he said that the NBN would be rolled out to Bendigo, and that they would roll it out faster and cheaper and sooner. I do agree with the minister on one thing: it is definitely cheaper than the Labor plan, because the cost of zero construction is zero dollars. If Labor had been elected, we were on the map. Bendigo was on the map. We were going to receive the NBN, but, to this day and this moment, this government has not listed Bendigo on the map.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some very confusing things about what has been going on. I do have a few questions for the minister. First of all, 5,400 homes on Mount Macedon will apparently receive the NBN. There are not 5,400 homes on Mount Macedon, so I am confused. My question to the minister is: is there a secret plan to develop Mount Macedon. Is he about to start training racehorses? Are they about to develop Mount Macedon? The plan that was released a few days ago was a simple disgrace. It does not deliver the NBN that is needed in Central Victoria. I call the government to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

About a quarter of these tragedies occurred at the beach. Today, I rise to reflect on the recent opening of the surf lifesaving season in Capricornia and to acknowledge the efforts of volunteers from both the Yeppoon and Sarina Surf Lifesaving Clubs. These volunteers play an important role in our communities by providing patrolled swim zones and help to prevent drownings on our beaches. The Yeppoon Surf Life Saving Club can be traced back to 1918 when a few enthusiastic people met at Ross Creek for instructions on life saving techniques. In 1926, the first club was formerly set up called the Yeppoon First Aid and Life Saving Club, with the first clubhouse built in 1930.</span>

Why have we reintroduced a Higher Education and Research Reform Bill today? Because it is the right thing to do for Australia, for students, and for the university sector. Labor cut $6.6 billion from our university sector and gave universities no prospects of replacing that revenue. That $6.6 billion cut has damaged the university sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The university sector themselves, led by Brenda Robinson at Universities Australia, have said that universities are in decline and they risk stagnation without reform. Every university representative organisation has called on the parliament to pass these reform bills with amendments. Because of Labor's $6.6 billion of cuts we are making the decisions that are necessary to give universities the opportunity to replace that revenue by asking students to pay 50-50 for the costs of their education when they are currently paying 40 per cent and taxpayers are paying 60 per cent. I think that is fair, and I think that most students would be happy to pay 50-50 for the cost of their education.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Labor and the Greens and four of the crossbenchers did yesterday. They voted against the reality, the inevitability, of reform. If revenue is not able to flow to universities from the students, then Labor are obviously proposing it flows from the taxpayer. That means they are proposing more taxes or to take the money from other parts of the portfolios of the government to give it to education. That is the inevitable consequence of the Labor Party's position. It is either higher taxes or it is cuts to other services to fund universities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members will know that the pilot phase that we rolled out throughout 2014 saw almost twice the number of students undertake these courses than we had expected. Thirteen hundred students from 37 universities studied in four locations: Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. In 2015 scholarship recipients will study in 17 locations including Brunei, Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vanuatu, as well as Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are studying in a wide range of disciplines—law, business, health, engineering, natural sciences, language, culture. In fact, the scholarship winners were at Parliament House today to meet with their local members and senators. One of the students spoke on behalf of the recipients. She epitomises what we are seeking to do through the new Colombo Plan. Michelle Howie, from the University of South Australia, will study electrical engineering and communications technology at the University of Seoul in South Korea, and she has an internship arranged by the Australian government with Samsung, Korea's technology giant. This is the kind of transformational experience that the new Colombo Plan is providing for our young people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This follows last week's announcement that a further 3,150 students from 37 universities across 32 locations will receive mobility grants this year for 2015. What we are doing is investing in our young people. We are investing in our region. We are investing in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the government's achievements this year. We have stopped the boats that saw 50,000 illegal migrants come to this country. We have stopped the deaths at sea. Twelve hundred deaths at sea occurred under Labor's watch. We have put an end to Labor's big new taxes. We have got rid of the carbon tax. We have got rid of the mining tax. We have signed free trade agreements with our three major trading partners. We are bringing the budget back under control. This government delivers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, who do we think said that? Who do we think said that?—the Chancellor of the ANU, Gareth Evans. My memory is that he used to be the deputy leader of the Labor Party. He was a cabinet minister in the Hawke-Keating government. Gareth Evans, speaking on behalf of the sensible Hawke-Keating ministers of bygone eras—when Labor had some economic credibility; when they actually believed in something—and speaking on behalf of people who believe in things, knew that these reforms are inevitable. They are necessary, and they will happen.</span>

That is 2.7 per cent over the year. This is the first full year of the coalition. Compared year on year with Labor, our 2.7 per cent in the last 12 months compares with 1.9 per cent under Labor over the corresponding period. It was 1.9 per cent under Labor. </span>

                  </a>  The fact is that at the moment the Australian economy is quite obviously going through the transition where the mining production phase is stepping into the place of the mining investment and construction phase. Export volumes have increased significantly, but prices have come down much faster than expected. And the answer is that we have got to continue with our economic action strategy to strengthen the Australian economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the best indicators of how important our reform agenda has been is the fact that we got rid of the carbon tax in the first two weeks of this quarter, and you can see what it meant for growth in the quarter; you can see how important it was to lower energy prices for everyday Australians but also to lower energy prices for Australian businesses, because the Australian dollar has been stubbornly high for too long and that has meant that we have not been able to cushion the impact of falling terms of trade in a way that we would have expected.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said all of that, moving forward we are absolutely determined to continue with our plan to build the infrastructure that needs to be built to make the Australian economy more productive and more successful. Ultimately, 2015 will be better than this year, and the years beyond that will be better again.</span>

I am not going to take the reform off the table, Member for Kingston, because, in case you have missed it, I have reintroduced a new reform bill this morning. It is possible that you might have missed the detail, being in the opposition, but can I just explain a lot of the support that we have for these reforms around Australia.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, everyone in the sector knows that this reform is necessary to protect Australian universities and to protect the quality of education for students. There are some in the Labor Party who know that, including the shadow Assistant Treasurer, and there are former Labor leaders, like Gareth Evans, who recognise that. But Labor is not interested in good quality education at our universities. Labor is not interested in research outcomes at our universities. Labor does not mind if our universities stagnate, as long as they can play the politics of an issue, day in, day out. Good luck to them. The only problem for Labor is that the Australian people can see through a political party that always plays base politics and never thinks about policy, and never thinks about what is good for Australia.</span>

There are a variety of issues that he has mentioned there. I would like to address them as best I can. He just dropped off a sheet with them on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the first issue he brought up, of the ag bank: might I remind the member that we are trying our best. We actually have $700 million now approved, one in a tranche of $420 million and the next in a tranche of $280 million. Imminently, within the next couple of days, we will have a further announcement in that space, to further assist people, especially in his area, and I am going to Winton on Friday to make sure that we remain in contact with those people. We know they are doing it tough. We are happy that, at this point in time, they are being blessed with a little bit of rain, and we hope that that continues, because that will assist the cattle prices and assist people getting back onto their feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also mentioned 200 hectare freehold irrigation blocks, and we understand that stored water is wealth. Water is wealth. And that is why I am chairman of the dams committee, and, on our side of parliament, we believe in building dams. We believe that this is a program that has to go forward. That is why we have already started. We have started four. There is Chaffey. We have started one at Nimmitabel. There is the redesign of the lakes at Menindee. These are the sorts of programs that are going forward, and we will have, imminently, further announcements in that space as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a dams committee together at this point in time. I have had all the major banks and the major financiers in, and this helps us promote irrigation in the north. In the last three weeks I have been to the north, to the Gulf, and looked at an area where we can deliver a new agricultural precinct near Normanton that would be bigger than the Ord. Do you know how much money they want from the government? Not a cent. What they want is to get the regulations right and get them right out of the way. If we get them out of the way then we can progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing he mentioned in the last minute was $50 million loans creating an abattoir for the Gulf midwest. Efic has the capacity to assist in export programs to get new markets going, and I might direct the honourable member to discussions—</span>

                  </a>  That is exactly where you would do it with Efic. I direct the honourable member to further discussions with the trade minister, who has that in his portfolio. I am sure he would give you a much better and more proficient answer than I would, seeing as it is not in my portfolio. But I commend the member for his interest in this area. We will be trying to do as much as we can to assist the people of the north, just like we try to assist everywhere. Under this government, we are turning around agriculture and we are getting the business done. I have got $2.45 as the price for live cattle at this point in time at Darwin. That is a classic example of the difference a different government can make.</span>

It is vitally important that we as a nation earn the future, earn future prosperity and earn future growth. Australia is blessed in that we are in our 24th consecutive year of economic growth, but there are some significant headwinds. Obviously there are domestic challenges, such as how we pay for the needs of an ageing population, and, importantly, the transition in the domestic economy, as we move from massive investment in mining and resources into a production phase and, at the same time, we endeavour to broaden the growth across the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons that we have set about delivering our economic action strategy is that we are trying to prepare Australia for a better future. When we first came into government we commenced the budget repair task. We reduced projected debt by $300 billion, and we were smart in approaching this budget in making sure that we built in the structural reforms that would give us savings over time without harming the Australian economy in the near future. We delivered the largest infrastructure package in Australia's history, and its timeliness could not be better given the massive number of job losses in engineering associated with the mining industry. We want those people redeployed to the biggest infrastructure program in Australian history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been our initiatives that have facilitated micro-economic reform at a state level, where we have state government's that recognise that instead of using hard-earned taxpayers' money to try and replenish the capital of electricity assets, or ports and so on, they can redeploy that capital into new productive infrastructure and still give the mums and dads of Australia the chance to own those Australian assets through sales. Crucially, we got rid of the mining tax, we got rid of the carbon tax and we dealt with a backlog of nearly 100 announced but unlegislated tax measures from the previous Labor government. And we undertook our own reform at our own level by selling Medibank Private for billions of dollars more than was expected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, you need to grow your market. As a nation we do produce goods and we need to make sure we have more buyers out there. That is why we have been able to land the three free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China. And I can advise the House that I have just been told that the Korean free trade agreement has passed through their parliament. So we are well underway to start the process of growing the markets and delivering the prosperity that every Australian needs and expects and only the Labor Party opposes.</span>

Will the minister finally give up his government's lie and admit that $100,000 degrees will be a reality under his unfair changes?</span>

                  </a>  I would point out to the House that postgraduate degrees have always been deregulated in this country, or at least they have been deregulated for many years. Therefore, in the university sector right now we have deregulated postgraduate degrees, we have deregulated international students being offered full-fee places, and undergraduate degrees have a market on one side of the mechanism, which is the demand driven system, but no price point in the market. That is why the system cannot work without a price point. If the Labor Party understood markets, they would know that on one side of the market is the offer, which is the service in this case, and on the other side there needs to a price point for the market to operate. That is what the government is proposing to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me quote from someone who has not always been a great friend of the coalition. In fact, Glyn Davis, the vice-chancellor of Australia's highest ranking university, Melbourne University, was a close confidant of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. I am not sure which side the deputy leader of the Labor Party was on. She was on both sides of the Rudd-Gillard divide. Nevertheless, he writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… without major tax increases, or diversion of public funds from other sectors, the current system is not sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, without the government's reform, without the opportunity to get new revenue into the system, there is no possibility for universities to be world class in the future. Labor ripped out $6.6 billion from higher education to cut costs. They gave universities no opportunity to replace that revenue. As Glyn Davis says, 'Unless the Labor Party is proposing to increase taxes or pay for universities through ripping services away from other areas of the economy, then the university sector is not sustainable in the short, medium or long term.' Therefore, the government has a reform agenda, unlike Labor that has absolutely no agenda. We believe in it and we will continue to prosecute it. I will continue to work with the crossbenchers to bring about change. I only wish that Labor and the Greens would want to be part of the national conversation rather than simply play politics with every measure.</span>

I realise that leaking is a familiar problem for political parties. However, I think we may need a bucket! Thank you, Luch. Now you can see why this building is in need of repair.

It is just two months since the government abolished the mining tax, freeing up the resources sector, creating jobs and confidence, and helping to combat the downward pressure that is on commodity prices. Labor's original proposal was said to raise $49 billion over five years. Of course, we know that is not true. In fact, we know that was a wild exaggeration and that it only raised a fraction of that amount. We just had to get rid of it because of the effect that it was having on the mining industry with respect to confidence and, by getting rid of it, we have saved the budget almost $50 billion over the next 10 years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we didn't just repeal the mining tax and restore confidence; we also repealed the carbon tax, which has gone a long way in helping businesses not only survive and compete but create new jobs. Again, can I quote from a business in the member for O'Connor's electorate, Fletcher International WA, the largest export abattoir based in Albany. It said: 'It was weight in our saddlebags'—that is, the carbon tax—'that we certainly didn't need. We are one of the last meat industry manufacturers in Australia and the extra cost from the tax was an impost borne against us.' Even the city of Kalgoorlie welcomed the ridding of the carbon tax. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that shows is that at the end of almost a full year of our being in office and when we reach the end of 2014 not only will we have achieved two of our key pledges but that we are taking the pressure off industry and creating confidence, which will allow industry to do the one thing that is critically important if you have a strong economy and that is to create jobs. Because if you do not impose the taxes that the Labor Party always imposes on business, then you are going to create jobs in the electorate of O'Connor and right around Australia. And it is about creating jobs, which this coalition is determined to do by removing Labor's bad taxes.</span>

                  </a>  And they are proposing another $15 billion of additional spending. I am perplexed at this new economic narrative from Labor that suggests that, if you spend more, the bottom line improves. Where does that idea come from that if the government spends more, then the deficit will improve? The bottom line is that, every time the Labor Party blocks something, there is a cost not just to us but to the Australian people. Nothing illustrates it better than the fact—something that the member for McMahon should be familiar with—that the Labor Party are opposing $1.1 billion of savings that they announced in relation to R&amp;D tax concessions for the 20 largest companies in Australia. It was the member for Lilley who advised the Australian people that that saving was essential to improve the budget bottom line, and the member for McMahon got all confused about it and thought it was related to Gonski. It was never related to Gonski. It was directly as a result of his attempts to try and fix the budget bottom line, which was a crisis when Labor was in government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. In my answer to the question from the member for Kennedy, I said that I hoped we would be blessed with rain soon. But I did not think it would happen so quickly, and in the chamber! What we have with these trade agreements is the capacity to expand our markets and build on the good work that we are already doing on this side of the House in building these markets and getting a better return back to the farm gate. Only today the honourable member brought a box of cherries around to my office. I feel like putting them in a bowl so that we can have 'a bowl of cherries'! The reason that is topical is that it is one of the areas where we are reducing tariffs. There is a 10 per cent tariff on cherries and, under the free trade agreement with China, that is removed. That helps us build that market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big markets in the member's electorate is beef and sheep, and we are having great success already and building on that. In the financial year ending 30 June 2014 we had an 80 per cent increase in the value of beef exports to China, with a 54 per cent increase in volume; a 50 per cent increase in the value of meat exports to the EU, with a 23 per cent increase in volume; a 43 per cent increase in the value of exports to Malaysia, with a 16 per cent increase in volume; and a 37 per cent increase of exports to the US, with a 22 per cent increase in volume. We are exporting more and we are getting vastly more for it. We are doing this because we are doing the business. This is how a difference in governments makes a difference in people's lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to continue to build on that with our exports to China. Across all rural exports, there has been close to a 10 per cent increase in value since we have been in government. This is the difference a government makes. But the question that has to be asked is: what was the former Labor government's plan for agriculture? I had to sit through the Croplife Budget Breakfast, where Senator Ludwig spoke about what he was going to do for agriculture. You will be interested in what he said, Treasurer. He said:</span>

                  </a>  is unsustainable. And why? Because when you subsidise one business you are taking out of another business, or from consumers.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We regret that international manufacturers in Australia have closed plants. Others have opened plants, and in fact other manufacturers have expanded operations in Australia. But the fact is that if we continue to have protection of Australian industry then that will impede our ability to get other countries to break down protections for their own industries. Australia as a nation produces much more than we consume, and because we produce much more than we consume we want free trade. We need free trade, because ultimately trade makes us richer. It is like running a corner store: the more people who come in the front door and buy your goods, the richer the business is going to be. And that is what we need to be as a nation. So, if we can do anything to break down the trade barriers of other countries, that will help us. We are a reasonably sized open economy, and as such we need to ensure that there is freer trade around the world. Everything we are doing is about creating more jobs, not subsidising foreign companies.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:46</span>):  I thank the member for Swan for his question and his close attention to these issues, and I table, for the purposes of answering the question, the monthly operational update for November for Operation Sovereign Borders. When I read the report, where it notes the number of suspected illegal entry vessels for the month of November, that number is zero. And I can tell you, that figure is on trend, because for 10 of the 11 months of this year that report has said zero—absolutely zero. There was one month when there was not a zero result, and that result was one—just one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant achievement in a year of achievements for this government. This is one of the many issues that this government has been delivering on, and it has not happened by accident; it has happened by implementing the policies we said we would implement, with the resolve to see those policies through. And those opposite did not think it could happen. Those opposite said that the policies would not be implemented. The member for Corio said that turn-backs would never happen. But this is the same member who said that a China free trade agreement could not be done in a year; he said it would be pure fantasy. Well, I would say that the member for Corio lives on fantasy island when it comes to the issue of border protection or when it comes to the issue of free trade, which is another area where this government has been delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it has not always been thus, because under the previous ministers—and I refer particularly to those ministers who served in the previous government who now make up the economics team of the opposition—this was the result: the member for Watson, when he was the minister for immigration, had an average number of arrivals each month of 26. He was there for only two months, and 68 boats turned up on his watch. The member for McMahon, although he had a lower average, of 14 per month, had a total of 398 vessels turn up on his watch. So, I would say that if we are looking to their future, if they wish to be ministers in Treasury or Finance, then, based on when they were ministers for immigration, the only business model their policies ever supported was that of the people smugglers. Labor failed in government on this issue, but their bigger sin is that they now cannot admit that they did fail, and they cannot see success in policy when it stares them in the face.</span>

                  </a>  Those opposite do not understand failure when they see it, and they looked at it every single day they were in office, whether on our borders, in the budget or anywhere else. And they cannot see success either, when it is right in front of them, because they will turn back on turn-backs; they will not do turn-backs. The only thing that will turn back will be the policy of turn-backs under this government. They will bring boats back. They will not turn boats back, because on border protection their failure is writ large.</span>

I refer to recent claims about jobs growth during his time as Treasurer. Treasurer, isn't it the case that average monthly jobs growth has slowed to just a third of the level it was before the budget smashed confidence? When will the Treasurer admit that the budget has hurt jobs and the economy?</span>

                  </a>  Getting rid of the mining tax actually helps with more jobs, because the mining tax was a sovereign risk associated with the previous government that ultimately raised no money for this government and was a handbrake on the intentions of mining investment. And of course we are the ones who are delivering the free trade agreements. The agreements focus so much on the services side of the economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, mining is a big part of the economy; it is a big part of exports. Mining and agriculture combined represent around 12 per cent of Australia's GDP, but they represent a massive part of Australia's exports, particularly in iron ore and coal. So, what we have to do is fire up the other 70 per cent of the Australian economy that is in services—in tourism, in financial services, in health services, in education services, in a range of different services. Many Australians are employed in those areas, retail being the largest. If we can fire up those sectors, which represent just 17 per cent of Australia's exports, we are going to see a wave of prosperity that Australia has not witnessed ever in our history. That will inevitably come about because of the emergence of the middle class in Asia which wants what we have. They want excellent health services, they want excellent education services, they want a better quality of life, they want better homes—</span>

Australia stands ready to give that to the emerging two billion people who are going into the Asian middle classes in the next 30 years. That is the most exciting opportunity our nation has ever had, because there is still going to be increased demand for our energy, our LNG, our coal and our uranium. There will still be increased demand for our iron ore and all our copper and gold. But, most of all, there will be demand for what Australians do best, and that is the best news for Australia's future.</span>

He, like this side of the House, believes that the outcomes for students should be our priority in schools and that putting students first is our priority, not putting the union first. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, before the election, promised that we would deliver 1,500 more schools with greater autonomy over four years from 2014 onwards. I am very pleased to be able to report to the House after this year of achievement that in 2015, starting next year, 800 schools around Australia, more than half of our four-year goal, will already be delivered in 2015—next year. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The states and territories that have signed up so far include the ACT, where 86 schools will gain more autonomy; the Northern Territory, where 15 schools will be independent public schools; Queensland, where 130 schools will be independent public schools; South Australia, where 225 more schools will gain autonomy; Tasmania, where 120 schools will gain more autonomy; and Victoria, where 250 schools will gain more autonomy just in 2015. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">New South Wales has agreed to sign up to the Independent Public Schools initiative. We are yet to finalise the agreement, but when New South Wales signs up in the very near future that will be another big injection of schools gaining more autonomy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia, of course, is the pin-up state in terms of independent public schooling and, to their great credit, they have said they will spend their own money and go their own way on independent public schooling. I take my hat off to Western Australia for wanting to go their own way in an area that is state and territory responsibility. The reason we are doing this—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The OECD said, 'PISA shows a clear relationship between learning outcomes and the relative autonomy of schools.' The Gonski report, often quoted, says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">… school leaders who are able to make decisions, including decisions about hiring staff and over the school budget, do well in terms of student achievement…</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So even the bible for the Labor Party, the David Gonski report, endorses more autonomy in schools. It is just another one of the feathers in the cap of this government after a full year in office.</span>

                  </a>  I think some of the honourable member's colleagues thought 'farrago' was an old Abba song. The fact is, we left the Labor Party with a terrific economic legacy, and it deteriorated under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. We are trying to rebuild that legacy so that Australians can be more confident about the future. It is difficult. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are headwinds in terms of terms of trade coming off from record highs. There are headwinds with the Australian dollar having been stubbornly high. There are headwinds internationally, where we are not seeing the sort of growth that was previously expected right across the world. There are headwinds when we have trading partners like Japan going into recession in the last few months; or in the case of Europe, Italy going into recession; or in the case of the Unites States—even though there is good news in the United States, the fact is that it is not as broad and as strong growth in the United States as many would have expected or hoped for. The fact is that China is not growing at the same speed that might have been expected and they are now our biggest trading partner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when you are resilient, when you are strong and when you are confident, you can cope with adversity. We are climbing a mountain of challenges, but we are determined to get to the top of it. Why? Because we have a plan to get to the top that is built on the back of sensible economic reforms, a measured approach to getting the budget back into surplus but also, importantly, doing everything we can to help to stimulate growth and confidence in the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say directly to the Australian people: we want you to go out and spend for Christmas. We want you to go out and spend not just for Santa Claus but for Australia. We want you to do that because, ultimately, 2015 is going to be better than 2014, and that is because we are putting in place the sorts of reforms that are making the Australian economy more confident, that are making businesses more confident. That is illustrated in the latest job expectation and job advertisements data which confirms that we are on track to get more jobs into the Australian economy in 2015.</span>

                  </a>  They were clearing away blackberry. They were rehabilitating the area, planting native species and restoring the foreshore. There was a great sense of purpose and satisfaction in what they were doing. We also travelled a little way up the road to where there was a foreshore which, a year ago, was covered in wrack and was putrid. As part of the coalition's Tuggerah Lakes recovery program, it is now free of weed, is open for the public to attend this summer and is going to make a real difference to the environment as well as a real difference to the local economy.</span>

We have gotten rid of the carbon tax, we have passed the emissions reduction fund into being, we have put in place one-stop shops across the country, and we have cleared $1 trillion of backlogged Labor projects which they would not say no to and they would not say yes to. But, perhaps, right at the heart of what I do, I take most joy in what the Green Army is doing. They are young people in the environment having a tremendous sense of satisfaction.</span>

My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer to today's national account figures, which show real GDP growth for the quarter is 0.3 per cent, less than half market expectations. Can the Treasurer confirm the same national accounts show that Australia is now officially in an income recession? When will the Treasurer acknowledge that the budget has hurt the economy?</span>

It is so irresponsible for the member for McMahon to talk like that because if he were to apply that test to real gross domestic income then there would have been what he calls three recessions under the last six years of Labor. You see, this is the problem: they have got no sense of history. But they were all there. They are myth makers. They do not understand that when there is a significant fall in the terms of trade it does have an impact. It has an impact directly on real gross domestic income. Labor do not understand that they are the problem, not the solution. We are the solution. We are the ones who are trying to strengthen the Australian economy. We are the ones who are trying to do everything possible to ensure that the good news keeps coming in relation to some of the key economic data.</span>

                  </a>  I have already pointed out that job growth this year under the coalition has been running at twice the level it was under Labor. Under Labor it was 5,300 a month, and under us it is 12,300 per month during the course of the year. I have also pointed out the strong retail trade figures for September. Retail trade rose 1.2 per cent, seasonally adjusted. This translates into a rise above market expectations for the quarter. Strong job advertisement numbers were released on 3 November—this is hugely important. Small and medium enterprise business conditions are at the highest levels since 2009.</span>

                  </a>  I cannot hear you guys over there now. It is amazing, isn't it? Deloitte Access Economics shows investment is strong. Ernst &amp; Young's Australasian Capital Confidence Barometer recognises that we now have 96 per cent of businesses believing the economy is improving, and 90 per cent are confident corporate earnings will be better than a year ago. Most importantly, we are starting to see consumer confidence levels, business expectation levels, and business confidence levels all at long-term trend. But there is more to be done. The only impediment is the Labor Party, which just does not understand economics.</span>

I know that every member of this House, and indeed all Australians, I believe, are concerned about ensuring that our children are safe online and that cyber bullying is stopped and its consequences are mitigated as much as they possibly can be. The member for Forrest has set an extraordinary example to all of us with the way she has campaigned about online safety and the way she has conducted classes and seminars in the many schools in her electorate and elsewhere to ensure children and their teachers and parents are made aware of online safety issues. This morning, another champion for children's online safety, the Parliamentary Secretary for Communications, the member for Bradfield, introduced into the House the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Bill 2014. This fulfils an election commitment to take real action to ensure that our children are safe online.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  It has been quite a week in this chamber. It has been quite a week in Australian politics. But the overriding impression left, by this government—for the Australian people—by their behaviour in this chamber and outside it, is their level of delusion, their level of denial and their level of misunderstanding of the impacts of their own actions. They just do not get it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most spectacular example has been the rather special performance of the Minister for Education over the last 24 hours—but he does not have the prize all to himself. In no area is their level of delusion and denial more worrying, more concerning, than when it comes to the management of our economy. One of the most important responsibilities given to a government is the management of the national economy, to ensure strong growth of our economy and to ensure that our finances are in good shape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the impact of their denial over the last 48 hours. We had the Prime Minister hold a press conference, where he said: 'Confidence is returning to our economy.' There is only one little problem with that—it is not. The figures are very clear. We saw it with the Treasurer today. He denied that the previous Labor government had achieved three AAA ratings from the three major ratings agencies. He just denied it had happened. I have news for him: it did, I am sorry to inform the Treasurer. He also made a mistake when it came to the unemployment rate, but we are not going to quibble over details. That would be unfair to the Treasurer, because he is not very good at details when it comes to the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They thought it would all be easy. That is the fundamental dynamic we are seeing played out in their management of the economy. We know that because they told us. The Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, said: 'There will be an instantaneous adrenaline charge in our economy.' If only it were that easy. Let's have a look at how that adrenaline charge is going. We have seen Westpac's consumer confidence index show a 13 per cent reduction since the election. We see the Treasurer clinging onto a bit of hope in the ANZ index. He said, 'Don't worry about the Westpac index. What would Westpac know about consumer confidence? Let's have a look at the ANZ index.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a little problem for the Treasurer in the ANZ index as well. If you look at the ANZ index, the annual average on that index is 111.4. But 111.4 for this year is not a great result, I have to break it to the Treasurer. In fact, it has not been lower since 1993. It is the equal-worst result since 1993, if you put aside the global financial crisis that saw consumer confidence impacted by world events. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the Treasurer valiantly deny any of this today. 'Nothing to see here,' he said. 'Move along; there is nothing to see in the economy. There's no problem.' He said, 'Look at jobs. We're creating jobs twice as fast.' A couple of months ago he said it was five times as fast, but it is a moving feast for the Treasurer when it comes to figures. Even on this level, his record is a very poor one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at job creation since the budget, it is a very poor story indeed. We have seen unemployment increase. We have seen 42,000 more people on Australia's unemployment queues since he stood at that dispatch box and brought down his unfair budget, which smashed confidence. We have seen jobs growth slow to about a third the level it was before he brought down his budget. And we have seen youth unemployment increase dramatically—to its highest level in 13 years—on this Treasurer's watch. They are the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at full-time jobs growth, as a total since the budget, it comes out at close to zero. Effectively, there were no full-time jobs created. It has gone up and down over the months, but if you look at the record since the budget it is a very poor one indeed. Today we have had two bits of news for the Treasurer, which he likes to ignore. He stood at the dispatch box and talked about the importance of services—and he is right. Services are 70 per cent of our economy. Services are vital. Confidence in services is very important in our services sector. Today we had the latest update. We have had several updates on the services sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those updates have shown the impact of this Treasurer's budget. The organisation which conducts those surveys, the Australian Industry Group, has made clear and explicit what is going on here and what is impacting on confidence in the services sector. It is this government's budget. They said it clearly. They said it in black and white. Again today AIG said that the services sector 'remained disturbingly weak in November, reflecting fragile consumer and business sentiment …'. The Australian economy remains stuck in the slow lane. This Treasurer, if you listened to him, would not think that. He does not appear to know it or recognise it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the national accounts, which showed a growth of 0.3 per cent. The Treasurer thinks that is a fantastic result. The fact that it is less than half of market expectation seems to have escaped him. I then asked him a very simple and basic question. But there was one word that could not pass his lips—there are two words that cannot pass this government's lips. There is a 'W' word—wrong—and there is an 'R' word—recession. There is a fact: Australia is in an income recession. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> said that income recession is confirmed as GDP growth slows, from just a couple of hours ago. It is very clear, but the Treasurer seems to not acknowledge it. What he has done by his words and his actions is damage the Australian economy. He has brought down an unfair budget—that is true. He has attacked the cost of living of ordinary Australians—that is true. He has brought down a budget which is regressive and fundamentally unfair. He stands accused and he is guilty of it. But he also stands accused of bringing down a budget which is bad for the economy, because he fundamentally does not understand it. He fundamentally does not understand his job. He fundamentally does not understand that when a Treasurer speaks it has an impact. When a Treasurer talks about confidence it has an impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people look to a Treasurer to understand what is going on with the Australian economy. When the Treasurer engaged in his irresponsible and ill-thought-out rhetoric in the lead up to the budget, he had an impact, because when a Treasurer speaks the nation listens. When a Treasurer says something, it has an impact, and this Treasurer could not resist playing politics. He just could not resist because he loves opposition. He could not make the transition to government, and the transition to government means there is a responsibility on him to talk about the strength of the economy and the strength of the budget, and he could not bring himself to do it. We saw confidence starting to be smashed just as he started to talk about the budget. We did not have an adrenaline rush; we had a Mogadon rush from this Treasurer as he started with his rhetoric, and it got worse with his actions. He has acted irresponsibly, he has acted immaturely and he has shown he is just not up to the job of being Treasurer. He is just not up to the task that has been entrusted to him by the Australian people and by the Prime Minister. He is just not up to it. That is why we see speculation that he is not going to make it to election day as the Treasurer, because he just does not understand his role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He does not understand the insult that he provides to the Australian people, and particularly to the people of Adelaide and Port Adelaide, when he says, 'We needed to get rid of the car industry for the free trade agreements. We needed to do that. I just didn't tell you at the time.' He did not say that, but he was goading Holden to leave Australia. He did not say, 'We need you to go so we can conduct a free trade negotiation with China and other countries.' He said that after the event. He does not understand the insult when he inaccurately says, 'We don't have time for something as outrageous as an open and transparent tender for a minor government procurement like the next generation of Australia's submarines. We couldn't possibly have time for that.' He knows he is wrong. He has been told he is wrong. We have again seen Australian Industry Group nail him for his error, and they are not the only ones. When it comes to this Treasurer, he just does not get it. He does not get it that he has an impact when he says that poor people do not drive cars. He does not get it that he has an impact when he says, 'Don't worry about the car industry, because we need a free trade agreement.' He does not get it that he has an impact when he says, 'We don't have time for such luxuries as an open and transparent tender. We wouldn't want to do that!' It is no wonder that people are speculating that he will not make the next election, because he is just not up to the job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They were committed to their own jobs and their own jobs only prior to the last election, but they were not committed enough, because they lost quite a few of those jobs and that is why they are on that side of the House now and why we are on this side of the House. They were not able to look after their own jobs, let alone anybody else's. The member for McMahon, that was a great audition for the top job over the other side—the opposition leader's job. It was not a really good rehearsal, but he will have to keep trying and I am sure that he will in 2015.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for McMahon mentioned two words beginning with 'W' and 'R'. I would put it to him that he was wrong about the two words that he used. 'W', when it comes to Labor, tells me of waste, and 'R' tells me of regional. I will get onto that in a little bit.</span>

                  </a>  I hope the member for Hunter stays and listens. There is the famous proverb: 'There are none so blind as those who will not see. The most deluded people are those who choose to ignore what they already know.' Surely that applies to the Australian Labor Party. There is a big difference between promise and performance. There is a big difference between what is needed and what is actually delivered. There is a big difference between Labor and the coalition, let me tell you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a year of achievement. The member for Hunter would acknowledge that. We began with budget repair—reducing projected debt by $300 billion. There was the largest infrastructure package ever—committed $50 billion; leveraging $125 billion. We facilitated significant state reforms; repealed the insidious minerals resource rent tax and the carbon tax, ultimately leading to the largest falls in electricity prices on record; privatised Medibank Private—the third-largest initial public offering globally this year, with over $1 billion above what we initially expected; removed around $2 billion worth of red tape; and repealed 57,000 pages of legislation. There was the end of the age of entitlement for industry. And there was more: agreement on three key preferential trade agreements—South Korea, Japan and China. We delivered smaller government, abolished 76 agencies, authorities and boards. There was $1 trillion of environmental approvals and 300 major projects were approved. It goes on and on, including rebuilding employee share schemes and dealing with the Labor tax backlog—almost 100 unenacted tax measures were taken care of. There was international leadership on cracking down on tax cheats. There was a 15-point Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development action plan. There is still more to come. Next year we have the Federation white paper and the taxation white paper. They will be key papers which are going to help the economic reform of this nation. And there will be further progress on budget reform and further preferential trade agreements.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Chifley was one of them and the member for Hunter was another. I am not quite sure about the member for Fraser. I think he was concentrating on his Eureka debate tonight. There was nothing but jeers and mocking laughter by Labor. Ignorance, ineptitude, irresponsibility, incompetence and absolutely incapable of seeing reason. That is Labor. It is writ large.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We compare our record of achievement, our year of achievement, with what Labor left this country: $123 billion worth of cumulative deficits, $667 billion worth of debt if nothing more was done, if nothing was set out to be achieved by the coalition. That has left this nation, the taxpayers of this nation—the mums, the dads, the families—with a $1 billion interest bill each and every month. That will increase to $3 billion if we choose to do nothing. Labor are opposed to $28 billion of savings including $5 billion of their own. This includes $9.6 billion of remaining welfare changes. We all know how rusted Labor is onto welfare. Labor want an additional $15 billion of spending restored which will worsen the budget bottom line by $43 billion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are looking forward to a stronger economy in 2015-16. Economic growth is projected to improve next year from 2.5 per cent to three per cent. Employment growth is anticipated to grow by 1.5 per cent. Stable unemployment will be around 6.25 per cent. It is too high, but it is certainly not as high as that which was recorded under Labor, and we are working towards reducing it all the time. Exports of goods and services are forecast to improve in volume with a seven per cent growth in 2015-16.</span>

                  </a>  Member for Hunter, I actually, kind of, heard you cheering today when the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, stood up and talked about the 39,000 agricultural jobs created since we came to government. He is cheering now, as he should be. From our farmers, Labor took away their water and took away their hope. The member for New England is getting on with the job of rolling out a drought package. He is getting on with the job of giving farmers back water, with the help of Senator Simon Birmingham, as well as giving them hope.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This coalition have succeeded in achieving a number of avenues, after only a year in government, following the debt and deficit legacy that we inherited from Labor after their six disastrous, miserable years in office. They were chaotic and dysfunctional years. We are getting on with the job of cleaning up after the disaster left by Labor. Labor presided over the most vast Australian debt position in modern history.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:none underline;">The Australian</span>, that reputable newspaper, on Tuesday this week there was an article titled, 'Money for marginals sees Labor exposed', which said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… a program for disadvantaged, homeless and drug dependent youth was set to receive $500,000 in round four of the project, but the decision of the panel was also ignored.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was in Narrandera, a town which really needed that funding and was really looking forward to it, but it was overlooked by Labor, even though Catherine King came into my electorate in the lead-up to the election and said that it was going to happen. But, of course, it was never going to happen because Labor, firstly, overspent the money from the mining tax by $17 billion or thereabouts, and, secondly, they had no intention of funding these very good programs, as the ANAO recorded. The ANAO report said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A feature of the Minister's decision making was the lack of strong alignment between the funding decisions taken and the panel's recommendations—nearly half of the funding awarded (48 per cent) went to applications that had been categorised as other than 'Recommended for Funding'. In total, 74 decisions were taken by the Minister over rounds three and four that diverged from the advice of the panel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a disgrace. What an absolute rort and typical of Labor. But the member for McMahon certainly benefited. He benefited from a multimillion dollar program, and I hardly think that the member for McMahon's electorate is regional. But, be that as it may, what an absolute disgrace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legacy that Labor has left Australians is 200,000 more unemployed. It is a shame that, amongst those 200,000, there were not actually more Labor people running for parliament at the September election last year. Gross debt, as I said earlier, is projected to rise to $667 billion. We are paying far too much in interest each and every month. That money could be used to help irrigate Australia, to help regional programs, to help fund the program at Narrandera for Outreach, for the unemployed and for drug dependent people. But, no, they laugh and they continue to pour scorn upon these very good programs that they should have funded. They promised that they would, but they actually failed to.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a big difference, as I said before, between actual performance and promise. That is why there is a big, big difference, also, between the coalition and Labor. We get on with the job of doing things, of creating jobs and restoring this country to the levels that it should be. All Labor does is wreck and ruin.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  In this annus horribilis for the Abbott government: they have given Australia back knights and dames; they have taught us that the name of our North American friend is pronounced 'Canadia'; they have suggested that the US is at risk of default—and I am sure the member for Riverina would not have made a mistake like that. They have shown their common touch by smoking cigars just before handing down the most unfair budget in living memory; enlightened us about the link between breast cancer and abortion; taken to the barricades to defend the rights of bigots; told us that poor people do not drive cars; said that the Australian Submarine Corporation, despite being headed by Sophie Mirabella, still cannot build a canoe; and shown us that demon dialling is the way to every crossbencher's heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they have not done is deliver a budget that will grow the Australian economy, improve egalitarianism and create jobs. In fact, just like one of the member for Sturt's text partners, they have run screaming in the opposite direction. This budget is Robin Hood in reverse. It gives billions to multinationals and hundreds of thousands of dollars to people with more than $2 million in their superannuation accounts but it takes one dollar in every 10 from the wallets and purses of Australia's poorest single parents. This is not a meritocracy; this is a budget for a mate-ocracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has attempted to bring in a GP tax. They have attempted to take one dollar in five of student funding from Australian universities. They have cut pensions and, in breach of their pre-election promises, they are attempting to cut into the ABC to turn it into a 'Very Small Business'. They have 'Shaun the Sheep'. They have told porkies about 'Peppa Pig'. In 'The Health Report' they are soon going to be asking, 'Doctor Who?' The<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>'Hollowmen' are on their 'Media Watch'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he was swearing in the Governor-General, the Prime Minister told Australians that the reason we have a Governor-General is to visit 'places that aren't important enough for prime ministers'. Right now that is a pretty long list. It includes universities, because you need a small SWAT team to get a member of this front bench to visit them. It includes hospitals. It includes childcare centres and it includes the entire state of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is about as popular in Victoria as a fruit fly invasion. He is about as useful as a porthole on a submarine. That is why they started their campaign for Victorians by sneaking in a fuel tax through backdoor means and ended up sticking to the GP tax like a captain going down on a barnacle-ridden ship. The Prime Minister shirt-fronted his Victorian colleagues and he is shirt-fronting Australians with his unfair budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is the 160th anniversary of the Eureka uprising. As Gough Whitlam put it in his 1973 Eureka lecture, 'Egalitarianism—by whatever name we call it—is at the heart of the Australian tradition.' But now, with inequality at a 75-year high, we have a government that wants to take from the vulnerable to give to the affluent—a government which is, literally, governing for the knights and the dames. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, on this side, have a proud legacy. We kept Australia out of the biggest downturn since the Great Depression. We put in place a carbon price that saw the biggest drop in emissions in 24 years—a great economic reform that allowed us to lower the taxes on work while we were putting a price on pollution, and which boosted egalitarianism, because it is the poorest who will be hurt by unchecked climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We made $180 billion in responsible savings, including means-testing the private health insurance rebate, reforming the PBS, and getting rid of the dependent spouse tax offset. Those opposite claimed last year that they would deliver a surplus in their first year and every year after that. They said there was no revenue problem and that there would be an 'adrenaline charge'. Instead of the adrenaline charge, we have had a government that looks like a dose of valium. We have had more tantrums than a daycare centre at nap time. They are blaming the opposition for opposing, blaming the media for reporting, and blaming the business community for failing to sell their budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is not the sales job, it is their very budget. We do not know what cuts will be in the mini-budget when it comes, but we know that what they are selling stinks. It is not the barnacles; it is the ship and the captain that should be sent back out to sea.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I would like to begin by reminding members opposite, and the Australian people, of the reason the government was changed on 7 September 2014. In 2007, Labor inherited a $20 billion surplus with zero net debt and $45 billion in the bank. Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion between 2008-09 and 2012-13.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mrs MARKUS:</span>
                  </a>  In addition to this, Labor left additional projected deficits of $123 billion over the next four years, from 2013-14 to 2016-17. These are the facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, over its six budgets while in government, Labor increased spending by an additional 50 per cent, totalling $137 billion. Labor's legacy on jobs was 200,000 more unemployed. More waste and more mismanagement was demonstrated through Labor's handling of the national broadband network, with an estimated blow out of $29 billion. Further blow-outs include $11 billion in border protection costs, $6.8 billion due to the overpriced cost of school halls, and $2.8 billion spent on the failed pink batts scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important for us to remind members opposite of the reasons the government changed hands last year. This year alone, the debt Labor created will cost $12 billion in interest. If we do not take urgent action and initiate policy change now our debt will continue to grow to an estimated $667 billion. Each Australian's share of Labor's debt is currently $13,500. Unless we take action this will grow by $1,100 annually and could potentially reach $24,500 in a decade. This is a debt that Labor left for each Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is determined and focused on building a strong and prosperous economy for a secure and safe future for every Australian. Since taking government the coalition has been active in commencing budget repair. The coalition has reduced projected debt by $300 billion so far, with 75 per cent of our budget measures having now been passed—contrary to what members opposite say. The Abbott government has committed $50 billion to establish the largest infrastructure package ever. This package will deliver critical infrastructure and create jobs and activity-boosting, long-term productivity for all Australians. Next year the $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund will be rolled out, giving local communities the opportunity and ability to receive the infrastructure that their people, families and businesses need desperately—creating local jobs and building local economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the coalition government successfully repealed the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 a year. The carbon tax placed direct pressure on over 75,000 businesses, costing over $700 million. Following the abolition of the carbon tax, the coalition government ensured that all savings would be passed on to business, giving the ACCC new powers. These powers guaranteed a reduction in operating costs for many businesses, easing the cost for many business owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has successfully agreed on three free trade agreements with South Korea, Japan and China. Our free trade agreement with China means more jobs, creating greater investment in Australia and a higher standard of living for all Australians. Once our free trade agreement is fully implemented, our agricultural produce, resources and manufactured goods will be well placed to compete in China's dynamic marketplace. It will mean access for our banks, universities and tourism operators—the heartbeat of the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. They will all receive better, more guaranteed access to the Chinese market. The concessions we have given to China will lead to increased investment in Australia, strengthening our economy, particularly increasing tourism, one of our largest exports, and providing cheaper goods for Australian consumers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  I have one question: does this Treasurer get anything right? He gets nothing right. Let's go through a roll call. Let's do a quick rundown. He told us that there would be an adrenaline surge in confidence. Wrong! It is 13 per cent lower than at the election. He told us there would be a million jobs, but unemployment is worse than it was in the GFC. He told us, 'We will achieve a surplus in our first year in office.' He said that. Where did that one go? Here is another one. He said budgets would be better under them. He said, 'I can promise that the coalition will deliver a better budget bottom line.' In MYEFO, in one budget statement, it went worse than ever. It will be interesting to see how MYEFO delivers in the next few weeks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love these quotes. Joe Hockey is like a quote vending machine: you just have to hit him and he comes out with another one. Here is another one—'We must return stable, predictable, honest government to Australia.' That is beautiful! He said, 'The objective of the coalition over time is to reduce the overall tax burden on business and taxpayers, not to increase it.' What about this one? He said, 'The government does not have a revenue collection problem; it has a revenue forecasting problem.' That is what he said. What happened when iron ore started moving? We suddenly started getting the excuses. We also got this whopper—'Poor people don't drive.' There was that one as well. Does he get anything right?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not, we do not and the Hockey enthusiasts do not need to answer the question, 'Does the Treasurer get anything right?' Do you know why? It is because the answer was on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> on Monday in an article headed 'PM's man to focus on economy' when Peter Hartcher wrote:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There you go! Does he get anything right? We do not have to answer that question because those opposite have answered it for us. When Joe goes poorly, they roll out Thawley. That is what they do. They are bringing in Thawley to help out because they have no confidence left in the Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder if the Treasurer even knew, because he has not had a good week of being told what is going on with his own budget strategy. Last week he had to find out through the bush telegraph that runs through the press gallery that they were about to announce that the GP tax was going. Whoops! When did he find out about that? He did not find out through the proper cabinet process that we were promised would occur by that side. He found out because it was running through the press gallery like wildfire. Then what happened? The Treasurer stood his ground and said, 'The GP tax will stay.' Will it stay or will it go? We do not know. This is the stable government we were promised by those opposite! Look at the way they are operating.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest economic challenge facing the economy right now is confidence. But how do you get confidence if the coalition does not even have confidence in its own Treasurer? We want the economy to be able to grow because of confidence. However, it has been thugged. Confidence has been thugged by the coalition. If you are a single-income family or a family that is on $65,000, you have had $6,000 taken out by this budget. Wages growth is hardly growing. It is probably the worst the RBA has seen since it began keeping records. Confidence has been further mugged because of the fact that the Treasurer has his hand in every wallet and purse, taking out money by the thousands through a horror budget where pensions were cut, family payments were cut, support for young unemployed people was cut, a GP tax was brought in and petrol taxes went up.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  Oh, dear, Member for Chifley! If that was a job application to be a stand-up comedian, I do not think you pass. No-one of sound mind or judgement can or should trust Labor. Labor's lies and incompetence have saddled this nation with a huge debt burden. Filling in such a massive hole will not happen overnight. When we last held office, the budget was in surplus. We were $50 billion in the black. We were earning interest, not paying interest. The interest on their debt alone is $1 billion per month or $45 per month for every man, woman and child in Australia. Two months of that interest would be enough to build the Fiona Stanley Hospital in my electorate of Tangney. That hospital is the most modern in the Southern Hemisphere. Just think what not paying the mortgage on the credit card would mean for infrastructure around the country. Think of what that extra money would do for people stuck in traffic on the Bruce or Hume highways, or in Sydney, Melbourne or even Perth. In short, responsible budgeting means living within our means. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key message is this: only the Abbott coalition government has an Economic Action Strategy that will grow the economy and fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Without ameliorative action, the country was on track for $667 billion of debt—$30,000-odd for every man, woman and child in Australia. One of Labor's biggest failures has been our biggest success—border protection. Stopping the boats was a key plank in our policy platform at the last election. We said that we would stop the boats, and we did. Not only have we restored integrity to our immigration system but we have stopped the needless tragedy of mass drownings at sea. Critically for this debate, it means that we have also stopped the haemorrhaging of public money. Under Labor, we bled money at every turn in this policy space. Search and rescue is expensive, administration is expensive and lifetime welfare payments are more expensive still. Many genuine refugees were left waiting, as queuejumpers risked paying people smugglers to make the journey to Australia. This injustice has stopped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The list of achievements is long, and my time short. This first Abbott administration is committed to action. We have scrapped the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 per annum. We have scrapped the mining tax so that this vital sector can create more jobs. We have handed down a $50 billion infrastructure package—the single largest infrastructure package in this country's history. We have delivered free trade agreements with Japan, with China and with Korea, and this means more jobs for Australians. We are putting in place long-term structural reforms to fix the budget. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, the Australian people said: 'Stop helping. We are dying of regulation suffocation.' We will heat the economic engine with economic bonfires of bureaucracy. The globally-interconnected competitive marketplace scares the pants off lazy Labor layabouts. How lazy? So lazy that your leader did not even bother to check that the petition was compliant when he presented it in this place recently. If they cannot run their own house, why would you let them run your house? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have no plan for our country. Our government have a clear vision: free trade and a higher value-added strategy of sustainable growth. I am pleased that a can-do government that understands business is now back in charge. My constituents in Tangney have been waiting for years to see work commence on the Roe Highway stage 8 extension. I welcome the $675 million to finish the Gateway WA project in Perth. Unlike Labor, we do cost-benefit analyses. You promised surpluses and delivered deficits. You promised conservative fiscal policy and delivered more and higher taxes. You promised stability and delivered two coups and much chaos. Let us get back to building hope, reward and opportunity. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  We have been hearing over the last 36 hours that this has been a great year of achievement by the government. The Prime Minister has been on about it, the Minister for Education has been on about it and the Treasurer has been on about it. Let us ask ourselves about some of those achievements. What have they done? They have gutted the auto industry in this country. They have created huge lines of unemployment in the manufacturing sector and done it deliberately. They have doubled the deficit; almost within three months of coming into government, they doubled the deficit to $120 billion over the forward estimates. That is a mighty achievement! Yet they come into this place and bang on about how, somehow, the deficit is a Labor problem. The deficit is not a Labor problem. The deficit has been doubled by these clowns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who else have they successfully worked with? Well, of course, Australian families! Every Australian family feels grateful for this government! They feel really grateful because of what this government has done! I think not. We heard just a moment ago about the impact on working families of changes to the tax concessions for families. That is a direct impost on those families—something that you have done proudly. You know that in your electorates the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are toxic.</span>

That is a very positive outcome for the people of Australia! I am sure that we are all very pleased and clapping the government 'Thank you' for cutting $80 billion out of health and education! They have tried to introduce a co-payment for Medicare treatments. I live in the Northern Territory, and I know people who would say to me, 'How the hell would I ever go to a doctor if I had to pay a co-payment of any description?' You know this to be the case in your own electorates.

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  We just heard from the member from Lingiari, and I have to say he was going on about the co-payment but he has such a bad memory that he forgot that he voted for the co-payment years ago when it was first introduced. He does not put that on the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the opportunity to stand here today and speak on this MPI and talk about the tough reforms this government has had to introduce to fill the path of destruction the previous Labor government created during their six years in charge of Australia's finances. The Treasurer really does have his work cut out for him in trying to clean up the mess that the Labor Party left behind. I have to say that he is doing a mighty fine job, given the state of the books when he took over after the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's legacy to our children is 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, with $123 billion in cumulative deficits, more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat and the world's biggest carbon tax. That is Labor's legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to say that we have commenced work on fixing all of those problems, and the Australian economy is well on the road to recovery. We have scrapped the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 a year; we have stopped the boats, preventing deaths at sea and saving the budget billions of dollars; we have scrapped the mining tax so this vital sector can create more jobs; we have handed down a $50 billion infrastructure package, the single largest infrastructure package in Australia's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Projects worth $1 trillion have been given environmental approval; we have cut around $2 billion in red tape; we have delivered three free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China, which mean more jobs for Australians. We are putting in place the long-term structural reforms necessary to fix the budget. This government has provided an additional $630 million to our police and security services and updated our national security laws to address the most pressing gaps in their ability to combat the growing threat of home-grown extremism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is a pretty good track record so far. In the face of all this progress and reform, the Labor Party have stood in the way and stomped their feet like little children. There is a clear difference between the Labor Party and the coalition: we have a plan, they do not. We have a vision; they do not. We care about small business; they do not. We care about jobs; they do not. We have a plan for budget repair, when they have a plan for budget sabotage. Our plan is the only plan, and we will continue to deliver on our economic action strategy, which I believe is the mandate given to us by the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party cannot seem to accept that the Australian people have given this government a mandate—a mandate to fix the mess. And we are doing exactly that. The Labor Party needs to get out of the way and let us do the job we were elected to do. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments were six years of chaos, waste and mismanagement, which turned nearly $50 billion in the bank into a projected net debt worth well over $200 billion. This is the fastest deterioration in debt, in dollar terms and as a share of GDP, in modern Australian history. Australians are already paying $1 billion a month in interest payments and that is not even our money—it is borrowed. No country can continue to pay the mortgage payments on the credit card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, thanks to the coalition, the foundations for a stronger budget and a stronger economy are now in place. Even though it was the Labor Party that left us in this mess of debt and deficit, they are still trying to sabotage our tough but necessary budget. They have voted against $28 billion worth of savings, including $5 billion they handed down themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must work together to achieve a budget surplus again; it is necessary for this country and necessary for jobs and growth. Over six budgets, Labor increased spending by over 50 per cent—that is $137 billion. The adults are in charge now, and we are cleaning up the mess the children made. The children are the Labor Party and they should get out of the way of— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  The first budget of the Abbott government was not just unfair; it was also mean-spirited, short-sighted and incredibly counterproductive. It was a budget that gave tax breaks to big business and put money back in the pocket of big polluters. It was a budget that took money from families and pensioners and that cut funds to renewable energy innovators, the CSIRO, and the Climate Change Commission. It was a budget that hammered the young unemployed, denying them any support for a period of six months, while seeking to gift six months' salary in parental leave to people on $100,000 a year. It was a budget that Cassandra Goldie, the CEO of ACOSS, described by saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The real pain of this budget - crushing and permanent - will be felt by people on low incomes, young people, single parents, those with illness or disability, and those struggling to keep a roof over their heads. These are the groups doing the heavy lifting …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a budget that Jennifer Westacott of the Business Council of Australia described by saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are very concerned about the risk that savings are falling too heavily on some families and young people trying to find work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it was a budget that has directly and indirectly cost jobs in areas that Australians hold precious: 1,000 jobs in science and innovation from the CSIRO, which invented wi-fi, Aerogard, plastic banknotes, the world's first effective influenza treatment, 100 varieties of cotton and the hendra virus vaccine, among many other things; 500 jobs from the most trusted source of news and current affairs in the country, the ABC; more than 10,000 jobs across the Commonwealth Public Service; and tens of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, the renewable energy sector, the automobile industry and ship building and maintenance. In August, Australia reached its highest level of unemployment in 12 years and for the first time since 2007 unemployment was higher in Australia than in the United States. The Prime Minister promised to create one million jobs within five years. Unfortunately, we know how much promises are worth from this Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott-Hockey budget is a remarkable failure. It has cost jobs and deepened the deficit. It has only succeeded in its aim of directing punitive measures against those who can least afford it and in cutting funds to health, education, science, pensioners, Indigenous affairs, the environment, the ABC and the SBS. As Crikey's Bernard Keane wrote earlier this week:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The political difficulties that face Hockey spring of course from that disastrous budget in May. The problem about that document wasn't merely the perceived unfairness of its measures, or the government's cack-handed attempts to alternately insist it was fair and explain its toughness was justified by the budget situation. It was that Hockey managed to produce a sadistic budget that didn't actually significantly advance the timetable for a return to surplus. The government was thereby left with the opprobrium of pursuing measures universally recognised as punitive, without the political benefit of being able to point to a fiscal light at the end of the tunnel. Worse, it's clear now that the tunnel is getting longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The damage and chaos of this budget have been visited upon so many Australians that it is only fair that responsibility for its harm be shared by those opposite. Responsibility belongs not just with the Prime Minister, but also with the Treasurer and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has presided over the biggest cuts to the Australian aid program in history—$7.6 billion has been stripped away in the name of Australia's political, economic and trade interests rather than continue the previous Labor government's focus on saving lives and reducing poverty. The foreign minister has not acted to stop the savage cuts in her portfolio that have seen hundreds of dedicated former AusAID staff lose the jobs they were passionate about and that have significantly reduced the critical work that Australia does to stop disease, to lower infant and maternal mortality, to provide medicine, clean water and sanitation and to build resilience and capacity. In fact the government is now threatening a further pillaging of the aid budget as a consequence of its own parlous economic performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">UK Prime Minister David Cameron spoke with courage and he acted with honour when he said that the budget of the United Kingdom would not be balanced on the backs of the poor. The Abbott government has not acted with honour or courage. It has not balanced the budget; it has made the deficit worse. It has laid the burden of its economic incompetence on the backs of the poor and the disadvantaged, both here in Australia and across the world. It has presided over a sharp jump in unemployment to the worst level in more than a decade. It has cut jobs and, what is worse, it has sought to crush the source of future jobs in the knowledge economy, in renewable energy innovation and through education and training. We talk about good policy and administration as future-proofing. Unfortunately, this government is busy punching holes in that future, and the jobs and wellbeing of thousands of Australians are right now pouring through those holes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  Some of the contributions to this MPI simply cannot go unanswered. I note the contributions from the member for Fraser and the member for Lingiari in particular. The member for Fraser spoke about the ABC. At a parliamentary committee meeting this week with Mark Scott, I was advised that the number of employees at the ABC is currently just over 4,000. Do you know how many of those are employed in regional areas, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott? I know this affects you. There are just 400. There are only 400 employees in the ABC in regional areas right now. It is Sydney-centric. It is not helping the bush. It is traditional radio, which we rely on. It is something that is exceptionally important to the people in my electorate. I note that the member for Fraser talked about the indexation of fuel. He said there would be a $20 increase for the average family. The member for Fraser should go out and buy some fuel. I suggest he gets a car. The price of fuel is down 14 cents a litre, right now, simply because of market changes. The member for Lingiari spoke about defence. What a hypocrite. In the 2012-13 budget, those opposite cut defence spending by 10½ per cent. It is the biggest decrease in the defence budget since the Korean War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know why we are in this position. It is because those opposite spent all the money. They did not spend just our money, they spent my children's money. How did they do it? They did it as quickly as humanly possible. It was an incredible waste of taxpayers' money. They started off like they had received an inheritance from the maiden aunt. Aunt Johnny left behind a $20 billion surplus, no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. What did those opposite do with it? I am sure they had a meeting, put some notes on the back of a drinks coaster, perhaps, or maybe a napkin, and blew the lot. They spent it all. What happened then? They got addicted to spending and then they went looking for more money. Where do you find more money? The first place you find it is your credit card. Obviously, the credit card came in the mail and they filled it. It did not matter what the interest rate was, that was fine—they needed to spend some more money, another 16 per cent. When we have filled the credit card, what do we do? We look for another one, because someone will send us another one in the mail, and we will fill that one too. When we have spent the inheritance and we have filled up the credit card what do we do? We go to the bank and borrow more money. The bank would not give them any more money, so they had to go overseas. So now they had overseas money, and they spent all of that. What to do once we have spent all of that? We get rid of the Visa cards because they are all empty. We spent the inheritance—it is gone. We can kick down the neighbour's door—maybe they will give us half a cup of sugar. That might help us out. But, no, those opposite went for our children. As the father of three children, I am appalled that they have been left with $13½ thousand each. That is $13½ thousand of debt to my three kids, who are completely innocent. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame. It is an absolute disgrace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But moving on, it is important that we note some of the things they are talking about with country areas. The member for Mallee, my good friend here, knows all about country areas. He grew up in the bush. We keep hearing about Country Labor. It is a shame that the member for Hunter, the shadow agricultural minister, has gone. It is important to note what they did for country areas: they took away their money. In RDA rounds 3 and 4, money should have gone to the member for Parkes and it should have gone to people in Gippsland. What did they do with it? They sent it to Sydney. Sydney is exceptionally important for the bush!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that the people in my electorate, the people of Hinkler, are very keen to see the Labor Party come up. The baseball bats are smoking hot still. They remember what happened in the live cattle trade industry. They remember what happened to them. They know they had to go into the paddocks and put their stock down because they had absolutely nowhere to go. What happened to the people of this nation in the bush is an absolute disgrace. It should never have happened and it will never happen again under this government. I am absolutely hopeful that I never live to ever see the people on the opposite side in charge of the Treasury again. They should never be put in charge of the people's Treasury ever again in my living memory. I never want to see it. They have absolutely squandered our inheritance. It is a disgrace.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the support that this bill received last night in the other place. The government introduced this bill as we are greatly concerned about the number of appointments that are being missed by job seekers. In 2013-14, job seekers missed 35 per cent of appointments with their employment service providers. That is almost 4½ million appointments that were missed. The measures in this bill are designed to ensure that more job seekers do the right thing the first time and attend their scheduled appointments or pick up the phone ahead of time and reschedule. In addition to ensuring that job seekers remain active and engaged, this bill will see a reduction in costs and red tape for employment services providers.</span>

The amendments preserve the substance of the bill by introducing new arrangement and penalties. They will strengthen the job seeker compliance framework and ensure the integrity of the social security system. I thank those who have contributed to the debate on this bill.</span>

We were very concerned that vulnerable job seekers were again going to be penalised by the government, as we have seen in other pieces of legislation from the government.

We do think that the discrimination in the job services market for those people who are over 55 is real and we think the government has got a lot more work to do before we could agree to such a proposal. I thank the government for actually considering the amendments and for taking them in the manner in which they were put into the other place. I am pleased to see that this bill be passing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  That bill required sellers commercial office space of over 2,000 square metres to obtain a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate before putting it on the market to lease or sell. This was important because the certificate rates the energy efficiency of the building and gives the potential buyer more information before purchase. That was a huge part of the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act. It gave the buyer more power to make sound judgement. It was also about elevating the importance of energy efficiency in modern buildings. The bill allowed the potential buyer or renter to have a better understanding of the operating costs and environmental impact of the space if they decided to rent or purchase the office space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been three years since Commercial Building Disclosure program began to administer the legislation passed under the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act. This program is important because there are a number of incentives for both building owners and tenants. For building owners, their energy-efficient office space is more marketable, increases future capital, lessens the need for upgrades later on and lowers operating costs. For tenants renting energy efficient office spaces, their operating costs are drastically reduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, for every one-star increase in the NABERS energy rating, a tenant can expect to save 15 per cent in energy costs. That is a significant saving that can be used to expand or reinvest in the company. While all of these aspects of the CBD program are of great benefit to Australians, there are always ways in which it can be improved. The program needs to be streamlined in order to reduce costs, cut out unnecessary bureaucracy and make processes faster. The truth about government bureaucracy and regulation is that it is a self-enervating thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition of which I am a part promised at the last election to deliver $1 billion worth of savings through red tape reduction. With only 13 months of the term gone, I am proud to report that the government has not only met but doubled that target with $2.1 billion in savings achieved to date through red tape reduction. This continues to grow every day. This is because there has been a paradigm shift. The modus operandi of every agency and individual in government now clearly understands that 'one in, one out' clearly means 'one in, one out'. These savings have been from common sense measures that should have been enacted years ago. Liberals know, quoting Ronald Reagan, that the most terrifying words in the English language are 'I am from the government, and I am here to help.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deloitte estimates that one million Australians are employed in compliance. If Labor is all about bringing government into business, then the coalition is about bringing business into government. Tenets of modern business, such as e-tendering, are finally being facilitated. Not only will this single measure save millions in direct costs, but the associated indirect efficiencies are innumerable and incalculable—not least of which include better, quicker decision outcomes. Time is money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government knows this first principle of business, because our people have been in business and continue to talk to business. There is a genuine desire on the part of the government to have a dialogue with business, especially small business. Small business is the engine of growth of our economy. The core of liberal philosophy is fewer forms and more reforms. In Tangney, my constituents have one clear message: please make things simpler. We need to reduce the footprint of government to enable the community to get on with creating jobs and building a stronger society for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is aware that we operate in a global marketplace. There are global opportunities, but also concomitant global challenges. As much as individuals have rights and responsibilities, so too do governments. By harmonising our reporting standards and our import standards for certain goods and services against international benchmarks, we recognise the reality of the global marketplace. It is the responsibility of government not to unduly disadvantage any business operating within the Commonwealth. The fundamental recipe for economic success that so underpins the basic functioning of our social contract is not rocket science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulation, while necessary in certain and restrained circumstances, should be the last resort and never the quick fix solution. The focus of this bill needs to be about what is the best way to achieve a certain specific outcome—namely, more energy efficient buildings. When it comes to regulation, I fall back to my default liberal belief system. That system says to me that the most effective, most efficient and most innovative way to achieve a desired outcome or change is not to punish but to incentivise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be all about carrots and less about sticks. The market is remarkably adaptable. It will innovate new ways of doing business and evolve, if government does not block its progress. The key is that the market will naturally evolve or grow in a certain more efficient direction. That is a logical, rational assumption. However, if one wants to achieve greater efficiency in building standards and household construction, one must look to incentives. Incentives are the only long-term, low-cost sustainable solution. We, as a society, need to reward our risk-takers and reward creativity. We can do this through an adequately tweaked incentives system—not by way of the rod, as Labor is wont to do. Labor has always been sceptical of capitalists' 'creative destruction', to quote the noted business cycle analyst Joseph Schumpeter. Efficiency was never, and is still not, a watchword of Labor. Red tape is Labor's love and is kryptonite to efficiency and innovation. On the issue of efficiency, let me briefly speak to an egregious omission in the drive for greater efficiency in spend and service delivery—that is, let me go nuclear for just a little bit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The politics of fear all too often override good policy and the desire of the majority of the community. The nuclear debate is a classic example of this. I led the debate with a speech to parliament in March 2005, advocating at the very least for critical examination of the merits of nuclear generated power. In fact, McNair Ingenuity's research between 1979 and 2009 shows support for nuclear power increasing from 34 per cent to 49 per cent in favour of the construction of nuclear power stations, with around 10 per cent undecided. More people are in favour of nuclear power than opposed to it, yet Greens' support for nuclear power still sits at around 22 per cent. We continue to get fearmongering from Labor and the Greens, despite critical power generation infrastructure issues. Nuclear power is the least carbon intensive of methods of generating power. The fact is that a nuclear decision can be made regardless of the policy framework on carbon dioxide. The reality today is similar to the USA, South Africa and other markets with abundant cheap coal—that is, nuclear is competitive with any other method of generating power. The only thing counting against it is a nonsensical ban on generating power using nuclear energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens cannot continue to say that anthropogenic global warming is the most important issue to confront our society, but then say that the one method capable of making a massive dent in carbon dioxide emissions should have a legislative ban associated with it. They also cannot continue to argue for this ban as it is 'economically too expensive'. If they really believe this, they would allow the repeal of section 10 of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998, knowing that power generators would not build a nuclear power plant if it were economically uncompetitive. But there is further hypocrisy. Labor believes in selling uranium overseas—but not in using it here. That is hypocritical and unethical. If it is too dangerous to use here, we should not be selling it overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to move past the politics of fear, in the national interest. It is time for politicians of conviction, with the foresight to look at the national interest and the future of our nation, to push for a repeal of this legislation. Let us ensure we do what is best for the nation and not hamstring one of our most important industries for the simple expedient of gaining votes using the politics of fear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Repealing section 10 would be a worthwhile step forward. It would remove the prohibition on a Commonwealth body operating a power reactor, and allow nuclear energy to be one of the options explored for most efficiently conserving and producing cleaner energy for Australia in the longer term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard to imagine that any such reactor would be built without much of the building standards and operating safeguards being set out in legislation. To simply keep a ban in place based on old fears is bad policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In sum, I support greater efficiency, less red tape and more results based policy. I support more hope, reward, and opportunity. I support this bill, and commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  On 31 March 2007, 2.2 million Australians flicked the switch to mark the beginning of what would become a worldwide movement in energy conservation. Designed to encourage individuals, communities and businesses to turn off their non-essential lights for an hour every year, Earth Hour quickly became a symbol for humanity's commitment to the planet. In fact, so popular was the movement in 2014 that Earth Hour was celebrated in over 162 countries and over 7,000 cities and towns worldwide—a great Australian export. The hour has grown into the world's largest grassroots movement for the environment, with beyond-the-hour projects and initiatives happening throughout the year. One of the reasons for Earth Hour's success was the tangible experience of conserving energy and the size of the impact that such a simple act can have on the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking at the launch of the International Energy Agency's <span style="font-style:italic;">Energy efficiency market report 2014</span> in October, IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven put it beautifully when she said: 'Energy efficiency is the world's first fuel. It is the invisible powerhouse working behind the scenes to improve our energy security, lower our energy bills and move us closer to reaching our climate goals.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy efficiency represents the most important plank in efforts to decarbonise the global energy system and achieve the world's climate objectives, the IEA's report found. In the IEA scenario consistent with limiting the long-term increase in global temperatures to no more than two degrees Celsius, the biggest share of emissions reductions—40 per cent—comes from energy efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor takes seriously the need to conserve and promote energy efficiency and to protect our environment for future generations. This is evidenced in our support for the Commercial Building Disclosure Program. This is a program that was rolled out under the previous Labor government in 2011, aimed at ensuring energy efficiency ratings for commercial office spaces over 2,000 square metres were disclosed to potential buyers and tenants. At the time, there were more than 21 million square metres of commercial office space in Australia's major urban areas, spread across more than 3,900 buildings, with commercial buildings accounting for 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Energy efficiency directly impacts running costs for the occupiers of buildings. Disclosure of this information before sale or lease will greatly assist potential buyers and tenants make informed decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were the words of the then Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mark Dreyfus, when this scheme was introduced in 2011. The energy efficiency information disclosed is in the form of a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate, and one of these certificates includes a star rating of the building's energy efficiency, an assessment of tenancy lighting, and additional guidance on how the energy efficiency of the office may be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commercial building sector is responsible for around 10 per cent of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions, and the figure is rising. Energy efficiency represents one of the cheapest and fastest ways that we can reduce our nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Credible energy efficiency information helps parties to make better informed decisions and take full account of the economic costs and environmental impacts associated with operating the buildings they are intending to purchase or lease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposed by the government, the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014, is, in many respects, a housekeeping measure in response to changes that have been proposed in stakeholder forums, and are changes that will reduce red tape. Importantly, the property industry is supportive of the Commercial Building Disclosure Program, with the Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council stating in November that: 'The CBD Program facilitates transparency of energy efficiency information, using a robust methodology. This is an important program that addresses the vast number of office accommodations in cities around Australia, using market forces to drive better performing, energy efficient buildings.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Raising awareness of a building's performance creates a market incentive for tenants to look for higher-performing buildings and for building owners to upgrade their stock and to improve their energy efficiency over the longer term. This leads to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, improved industry capacity and can act as an ongoing industry stimulus. Aside from the benefits in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, the CBD program has a broader range of impacts which are not always captured and easy to quantify, such as increased industry capacity and potential building upgrades that go beyond improving just the energy efficiency of a building but may also improve water use, indoor environment quality and other elements.</span>

The report found that a range of factors, from air quality and lighting to views of nature and interior layout, can affect the health, satisfaction and job performance of workers. Staff costs, including salaries and benefits, typically account for 90 per cent of a business operating costs. It follows that the productivity of staff, or anything that affects and impacts their ability to be productive, should be a major concern for any organisation. The report also found that even the smallest of differences can have a large affect. What may appear to be a modest improvement in employee health or productivity can have a significant financial advantage and implication for employers.</span>

Support for the encouragement of energy efficiency as the world's first fuel and an invisible powerhouse move us closer to reaching our goals when it comes to reducing emissions and improving our environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I am pleased to rise on the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014. I have just been for a quick walk outside and I noticed there is some fantastic soaking rain here in Canberra. I hope that many other parts of our country which are experiencing drought at the moment and doing it a bit tough are sharing some of the rain that we are getting here in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010. That particular act requires energy efficiency information to be disclosed in most cases when a commercial office space of 2,000 square metres or more is offered for sale or lease. I support both the amendment and the original bill because they provide the informational remedies to help the market work more effectively and allow someone that is considering to lease or to purchase office space to compare not only the cost of the rental per square metre but also how much it will actually cost to operate so they can make a good comparison—apples for apples. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing I would note is that, from many of the contributions from members of the opposition, it would seem that they think that this energy efficiency would not have come about unless it was for government coming in and interfering and making all these rules and regulations. A decade before the original act was passed in 2010, one of the jobs that I did before coming to this House was to design decorative lighting fixtures, and one of the things I had to consider was energy efficiency. I would work with interior designers and we would work out how we could make a particular light fixture more energy efficient, especially in commercial buildings and hotels. Where we had lighting in public areas and corridors—where those lights were on 24-hours a day, often seven days a week, 365 days of the year—it was a very simple equation to work out that, if we could change that particular fixture from an incandescent fixture to a compact fluorescent fixture, there would be substantial energy savings to the operator not only in electricity costs but also in changing the bulb, because compared to the relatively short span for an incandescent bulb the span for a compact fluorescent bulb is substantially longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is something the market itself was doing many years in advance—and not just here in Australia. I also did a couple of projects over in America where I had the same situation. We had to design light fixtures for a project in the USA, a hotel in California. They had to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, where you had to have special things. The fixture had to be less than four inches out from the wall and you had to fit your compact fluorescent lamp in there—so you could actually come up with energy efficient savings. This was not something that was mandated by government; this was something that the market was delivering at the time. As I said, this is simply an informational remedy that adds to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make one comment on the compact fluorescent lamps. Yes, they save in energy costs between 60 and 80 per cent of our old incandescent bulbs. They also have much greater longevity. But there is an issue, because those bulbs contain mercury. Some numbers I have looked at indicate that, around Australia, those compact fluorescent bulbs currently being dumped in landfill release into our environment 1,100 kilograms of mercury, because when the bulb breaks the mercury is released. In New South Wales, just as a rough estimate, I worked out that that is about 340 kilograms of mercury through compact fluorescent globes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In comparison, when all our coal-fired power stations in New South Wales burn coal they release 164 kilograms of mercury. So we are actually releasing double the amount of mercury into the atmosphere through compact fluorescent globes going into landfills, as opposed to what is released from our coal-fired power stations. In fact, the US Environmental Protection Agency produced a document that talks about what to do if a compact fluorescent light bulb breaks in your home. If the bulb, a very thin filament of glass, breaks, it says, firstly: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a glass jar is not available, use a sealable plastic bag. (NOTE: Since a plastic bag will not prevent the mercury vapor from escaping, remove the plastic bag(s) from the home after cleanup.)</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are great advantages in compact fluorescent bulbs, but we also need to consider, as we do with all legislation, the unintended consequences.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to make a few comments in response to some of the other things raised in this debate. The member for Newcastle went on about the importance of the RET, the renewable energy target. I believe if we look at this matter, using common sense and logic, anyone who believes in a truly renewable energy solution will realise that mandating the RET at this stage of time where technology stands today will actually send us backwards. It will be counterproductive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An article was written a couple of weeks ago by two Google engineers: Ross Koningstein and David Fork. They worked for several years on a project that Google called RE&gt;C—which means RE, renewable energy, cheaper than coal—to see how they could produce electricity from renewable energy cheaper than from coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to quote a few things that they said. Remember that these people are no sceptics. I quote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the start of RE&lt;C, we had shared the attitude of many stalwart environmentalists: We felt that with steady improvements to today's renewable energy technologies, our society could stave off catastrophic climate change. We now know that to be a false hope …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we reflected on the project, we came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions of carbon dioxide emissions. Trying to combat climate change exclusively with today's renewable energy technologies simply won't work …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are not my words; they are the words of Google engineers. They continued: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… even if we shut down every fossil-fueled power plant today, existing CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> will continue to warm the planet.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even if every renewable energy technology advanced as quickly as imagined and they were all applied globally, atmospheric CO2 levels wouldn't just remain above 350 ppm—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So to mandate the use of a form of inefficient technology that will not result in significant reductions in CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions is simply counterproductive and will send us backwards. And, if there is no change to that renewable energy target, $17 billion of our nation's precious and limited resources will simply be wasted. That will make us poorer. If we are going to solve the issues by coming up with a technology whereby we can actually produce electricity cheaper than we can from coal, gas or nuclear, then the last thing we should be doing is investing money in inefficient technologies that will simply not achieve that goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Moreton talked about China and how China was taking great action on renewable energy. I say to the member for Moreton: come in spinner! Either he did not read the agreement or he simply does not understand it. If you look at the agreement you will see that, between now and 2030, China will continue to increase their use of coal every single year for the next 16 years, up to 2030. They will roll out more and more coal fired power stations. When they get to 2030, the agreement is not that they will wind back anything; the agreement is that they simply will not increase their CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions. I cannot understand how anyone could be so deluded to think China are doing all these things on renewable energy and taking steps to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. It is absolute nonsense; it is the complete opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Moreton also went on about jobs. He said the carbon tax could create jobs and that we need government planning. I would recommend to the member for Moreton that, over Christmas, he read a book entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Uncle Sam Can</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">t Count</span>. I will read the introduction. It says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… government investments have failed dismally. They not only drain the Treasury of cash but also impede economic growth, and they hurt the very companies they try to support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Why does federal aid seem to have a reverse Midas touch? Simply put, federal officials don't have the same abilities or incentives as entrepreneurs. In addition, federal control always produces political control of some kind.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I highly recommend that the member for Moreton read this book over the holidays. The member for Kingsford Smith came in here and greatly praised Earth Hour and about how we turn off our lights. I would suggest to the member for Kingsford Smith that, if he thinks it is good that we should turn off our lights to somehow celebrate something, next time Earth Hour rolls around he should perhaps go to North Korea. Because there they celebrate Earth Hour every night, not for one hour but for the entire time of darkness. If you look at one of those satellite maps you will see North Korea at night-time, in complete darkness and, next to it, South Korea completely illuminated. Perhaps that is what the member for Kingsford Smith should look at.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally—and this could be my last contribution for the year—this bill actually helps reduce red tape. That is one of the goals that the coalition has. But it is not just by itself. We can look back over the year and think of the wonderful successes that we as a government have had, something we can all be very proud of. We have seen with the repeal of the carbon tax the biggest fall of electricity prices on record. I remember a member of the opposition in the last parliament, sitting here and saying that it could not be done, it wouldn't be done and we wouldn't and couldn't repeal it. We have repealed it and, from that, we have seen the biggest fall in electricity prices in our nation's history.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, there has been success when it comes to stopping the boats and, more importantly, stopping the deaths at sea and regaining control of our borders. Madam Deputy Speaker, if you were to go back 12 months and frame a market on how many boats would come in this 12-month period and you wanted to bet just one boat in 12 months, I think you could almost write your own ticket.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That achievement has been remarkable. Again, it is something that the Labor Party, when they were in government, said could not and would not be done. Well, it has been done, it has been achieved.</span>

The great news is that this will not be Sydney's second airport, it will be the first international airport for Western Sydney. Western Sydney itself is now strong enough, economically powerful enough, that it deserves its own international airport. After 50 years we have made that decision.</span>

Over the next four years we will see a 50 per cent increase in spending on New South Wales public schools. I see that the member for Grayndler is at the table. He, like me, comes from a public school background, so I am sure he will celebrate that 50 per cent increase in spending.</span>

We have to do that. If we continued to spend in the way the previous Labor government did, we would be betraying our children and stealing from our grandchildren. That is why bills like this are important. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I rise to make a brief contribution on the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014. This is about the ability to disclose the energy performance of commercial buildings above 2,000 square metres that are offered for sale or lease. As a tradesman, as an electrician, as an electrical engineer who has had something to do with quite a number of pieces of legislation and compliance over many years, I think it is good that we are acting to streamline some of the red tape. While energy efficiency is important, it is challenging in an environment where you keep changing tenants or a building is offered for sale multiple times. Energy efficiency is predominantly around lighting; that is typically where you gain the most efficiency. I would like to speak a bit about that. I concur with a number of the comments made by the member for Hughes, particularly around energy efficient lighting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commenced work as an apprentice on 13 January 1987. At that time we still had tungsten lamps, incandescent lamps, and there were many of them. What I recall about them is that they were incredibly cheap. They were constructed from glass, tungsten and brass—all naturally occurring elements. Even with inflation and everything else, you would expect that you could still purchase those types of lamps for $1 or even $1.20. However, energy efficient lamps are incredibly expensive. They are between $6 and $11 per fitting. That adds an enormous amount of cost to building houses and commercial buildings. But it does reduce electricity use; there is no doubt about that. It certainly reduces the amount of energy used for lighting. Lighting is one of the biggest consumers of energy in commercial buildings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Electricity Market report in August 2014 indicated that there is enough generating capacity in Australia connected to the NEM to last for the next decade. We will need no additional generating capacity for another 10 years. And that is in all economic circumstances—low, medium and high growth and low, medium and high risk. So why is it that we are looking to invest more money in generators of renewable energy at a time when we certainly cannot afford it? I am sure that 10 years is ample time for technology to improve—and it is improving rapidly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is time to consider the nuclear debate—and I note the previous contributions about nuclear energy. As an electrical engineer, I can tell you that nuclear energy needs to be considered. But I note that the scare campaign from those opposite has already commenced. In recent days I have received on my Twitter account a report from 2007 about how coastal towns in Queensland are likely locations for a nuclear plant. My seat is based on Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. This is an area in Australia that is more likely to have some type of volcanic activity, so I think it is highly unlikely that it will be considered for the construction of a nuclear plant. Given that we will not need any additional generating capacity for another decade, this is something which I believe we can take time to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we need to think about is that power consumption in this country is falling like a stone. We are using less electrical energy now than we were 10 years ago—far less—and our usage continues to fall. We are using less power, so why do we need to build more generating capacity when we are oversupplied to the tune of 135 per cent? It makes no sense to me at all. As a practical person from a practical background, I do not see the sense in spending the taxpayers' money for no purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments from the member for Hughes around the disposal of energy efficient lighting are bang-on. Crompton, one of the largest producers of lamps in the world, has advised that mercury levels are of concern—and this is something we need to consider. In fact, their advice is that those lamps should never be disposed of in landfill at all. You can imagine how many lamps in Australia go straight into the bin and then to landfill. So we really need to consider what it is that we are trying to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note the contribution from the member for Moreton and his comments around China. Having been to Guangzhou and Shanghai, I can say in all honesty that they have the worst pollution I have ever seen. I have travelled all over the place but I have never seen anything as bad as the pollution in those towns. So Australia's contribution is good. This is a great country to live in. Certainly the air is clean, and we are doing the right thing in terms of the environment. I congratulate Minister Hunt on his activities. However, this is all about the energy efficiency scheme, and it is a scheme that I support, of course, and I support the amendments. I said my contribution would be brief. Thank you.</span>

Some of them even managed to talk about the content of the bill! It was a wide-ranging debate, but I would like to thank them for their attention and contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Amendment Bill 2014 will streamline and improve the efficiency of the Commercial Building Disclosure Program, which is underpinned by the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act 2010. I would point out that the legislation underpinning that was passed with bipartisan support back in 2010. In fact, the background work on the Commercial Building Disclosure Program was initiated back in 2004 under the Howard government's national framework for energy efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commercial Building Disclosure Program is helping to improve Australia's building stock by encouraging all parties in a purchase or lease transaction to consider energy efficiency. Disclosing energy efficiency information provides everyone with access to consistent and meaningful information about the building's energy performance and makes it easier for companies to buy or rent more energy-efficient office space. Electricity is money, and businesses need to make sure that they spend their money wisely, effectively and efficiently. Reductions in consumption of electricity help the bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed in this bill are sensible measures designed to streamline the operation of the Commercial Building Disclosure Program and respond to industry suggestions for improvement—because, after all, they are the people with the skin in the game. The bill I introduced in the House of Representatives on 22 October reflects the government's commitment to not only reduce the regulatory burden on businesses but also support business flexibility and productivity. Key amendments, coupled with complementary changes to the regulations, will remove the need for energy efficiency assessments for transactions that are not market visible, such as between wholly owned subsidiaries or in the case of unsolicited offers from a single party. A further amendment will introduce the ability to determine a commencement date for a Building Energy Efficiency Certificate—a BEEC—that is later than the date of issue. This will help large property businesses who are wishing to proactively maintain current BEECs for their property portfolios where synchronising annual certification across a portfolio has become an efficient business practice. These amendments will improve the operation and effectiveness of the Commercial Building Disclosure Program and result in regulatory savings of around $600,000 annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, the government has commissioned an independent review of the Commercial Building Disclosure Program, and I advise the House that a final report will be provided to the Minister for Industry in the first quarter of next year. In the interim, this bill will ensure that there is a streamlined process to provide consistent and meaningful information about building energy performance to the market to allow companies to make more informed decisions when buying or renting buildings. On that basis, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government's plan to abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission is an insult to the good work of the charitable sector, and to all Australians that want accountability and transparency when it comes to their generous donations."</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me start with a story of great concern. It is about some scammers who set up charities with names such as Friends of the Disabled Children's Task Force, Friends of the Underprivileged Children's Task Force, and Chronic Constructive Pulmonary Disease of Australia Incorporated. Australians, inspired by a deep sense of generosity, donated more than $1 million to them. It turned out that there was not much evidence of the money going to the disadvantaged or needy, and those charities have now been shut down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All scammers are dodgy, but I have always regarded charity scammers as a particular form of low life. Other scammers exploit greed or lust or ignorance, but charity scammers prey on our goodwill; they take that great Aussie tradition of wanting to help the vulnerable, and they use it to line their own pockets. Cracking down on scams was one of the main reasons Labor set up the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission in 2012. Before we established the commission, Australians had no central register to find out whether a charity was dodgy or legit. Now if someone comes to your door asking for money, you can jump onto www.acsnc.gov.au and check them in an instant. And the charities commission is proactive when it comes to dealing with scammers. Earlier this year it deregistered two Western Australian groups after a five-month investigation showed that their 'benevolent' work was a sham.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission in cracking down on scammers has been first-rate. They received over 200 complaints in their first year, including 48 for fraud or criminal activity. Cracking down on scammers is absolutely vital, because, if we do not, we not only hurt those who donate but also sap the goodwill of others who might donate to a good charity but are too concerned that it might be dodgy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Charities are fundamental to the Australian way of life. Charities in the not-for-profit sector employ more than one million Australians, generate almost five per cent of GDP and turn over about $1 billion a year. As David Crosbie has put it: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACNC is important to how charities do business, yet the government chooses to ignore the majority of charities in deciding what it will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its inception, the charities commission has seen more than one million hits on www.acnc.gov.au. According to their six-month report, average registration time for charities was 11.4 days. In the first six months they had answered 14,500 phone calls, responded to 6,900 written inquiries and registered 500 new charities. The benchmark for the charities commission and the tax office to decide on tax concession status was 85 per cent within 28 days, but the charities commission has significantly exceeded that, reaching a level of 95.6 per cent of charities whose tax status had been determined within 28 days. As David Crosbie notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACNC is more efficient than the government regulators it replaced, is doing good work and deserves a chance to achieve its three goals of reducing red tape, increasing public trust and strengthening the charities sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of Indigenous charities, the charities commission is playing a particularly important role. The ACNC employs two Aboriginal liaison officers to provide assistance to customers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent who might prefer to liaise with staff from an Aboriginal background. Axing the ACNC would hurt Indigenous charities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The charities commission has launched the Charity Passport, a secure online system to save charities from reporting the same information to multiple government agencies. As ACNC commissioner Susan Pascoe, about whom no-one seems to have a bad word—even those who want to scrap the charities commission—has noted: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A single charity that conducts fundraising across the country, and receives government grants, may need to report to more than 10 different government agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Charity Passport is the key to the ACNC's 'report once, use often' framework, cutting down the amount of time charities spend on duplicative reporting to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the passport, we can securely share information the ACNC collects from registered charities with authorised government agencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Charity Passport has been tested by two government agencies, and the charities commission is encouraging more government departments to sign up. The Charity Passport is being deployed in two phases: the first using a file transfer protocol repository; and the second phase, scheduled for implementation around now, involving integration with agencies' IT systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of the charities commission is a long one. There were external inquiries encouraging the federal government to set up something akin to the charities commission in 1995, 2001 and 2010. There have been parliamentary committee reviews, issues and discussion papers, exposure drafts and consultations with experts. Indeed, the Australian Taxation Office, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry as far back as 2001, said as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is also our view that administration would be better served by a single independent common point of decision making on definitions leading to conclusions about whether organisations are charitable or non-profit, such as occurs with the Charity Commission in the UK, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A bipartisan parliamentary report in 2006 by the House of Representatives Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended:</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in consultation with the not-for-profit sector and the States and Territories:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a House of Representatives committee report commissioned by the member for Berowra. It was a bipartisan committee report, and one of those who signed off on it was the shadow Prime Minister—sorry, the Prime Minister's shadow—the member for Wentworth. The member for Wentworth then thought that the charities commission was a very good idea, as every sensible contributor in this sector does.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission inquiry, chaired by Robert Fitzgerald, who I will refer to later, said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Corporate Australia long ago rejected such a regime and begs the question as to why the not -for -profit sector should be burdened by such a cumbersome regime?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the process of bringing the ACNC into being, Labor's shadow Treasurers, including the now Leader of the Opposition and the then member for Lindsay, David Bradbury, engaged extensively with stakeholders and addressed those stakeholders' concerns systematically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where religious institutions were concerned about the impact on small parishes who had few personnel and little income, it was addressed by providing a financial and governance exemption for basic religious charities. Where schools wanted to ensure that they would not have to report twice to the charities commission, this was addressed through an agreement that avoided duplicate reporting. Charities incorporated as companies limited by guarantee wanted to ensure that they did not have to annually report to both ASIC and the ACNC, so the arrangement to report once was put in place. Certain philanthropic funds did not want their details published to avoid unsolicited requests, so the commissioner exercised her discretion to ensure that nondisclosure of key information can occur. Information provided by Indigenous organisations to the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations is sufficient for ACNC services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the process of setting up the charities commission was a highly consultative one—one which involved a great degree of engagement with the charitable sector. This stands in stark contrast to the lack of consultation from this government. It has to be said that the government is not moving quickly on this bill. By my count, it has been 253 days since the minister gave his speech attempting to scrap the charities commission. In that 253 days, the minister has engaged in frighteningly little consultation with the sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Social Services was asked in the Senate estimates committee who it had consulted with over the charities commission repeal. It named a number of bodies. One of these was the Governance Institute of Australia. They were a bit surprised. The minister had been suggesting that he had consulted with them. They said, in their letter dated 30 May 2014:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is misleading. Governance Institute has not at any time been consulted by the Department of Social Services. A representative of Governance Institute attended a forum organised by Melbourne Law School had which staff members representing the Department of Social Services were also present.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is their idea of consultation: 'We were in the same room as you, so we consulted you.' That is not consultation. Justice Connect wrote in similar terms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We were surprised and concerned to see the name of our organisation, Justice Connect, on a list of 'organisations DSS had consulted about the ACNC'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We understand that we were listed by the DSS because a representative from our organisation attended a Melbourne Law School event on the future of charity regulation, which was also attended by DSS representatives and Minister Andrews' adviser.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear, the minister was not in the room. His adviser was in the room. And they call that consultation! Justice Connect said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore request that the record be corrected to indicate that we have not been consulted, despite specifically requesting this opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the minister is rejecting attempts by worthy organisations to consult and is then going away and telling the Senate that he has consulted with them. Part of the failure to consult occurs because the charities commission issue has not been placed in the hands of the Assistant Treasurer—of course, the government does not have an Assistant Treasurer—it has been placed in the hands of Minister Andrews. As John Butcher from the University of Canberra puts it: 'Thus far the field appears to have been abandoned to ideological considerations and, seemingly, the privileged voices of a small number of organisations that have the ear of Minister Andrews.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the support that the charities commission enjoys within the sector. The 2014 Pro Bono Australia State of the Not for Profit Sector Survey found that four out of five not-for-profits stated that the charities commission was important to a thriving charities sector. Only six per cent agreed with Minister Andrews that the charities commission should be scrapped and responsibility for regulating charities returned to the tax office. Even the National Party gets more support than that. Indeed, the Pro Bono survey was conducted in both 2013, before the election, and 2014, after the election. So, after trawling the country—</span>

The opportunities offered by the establishment of a one-stop regulator would be forgone. Independence from the Australian Taxation Office will be abandoned, allowing identified conflicts to persist.

More than 50 organisations have been brought together by the Prime Minister to oppose scrapping of the charities commission they had taken the brave step of writing open letter to the Prime Minister. You know how brave that is, because we know from the experience of the Howard government that these are people who go after charities that speak out to them. Just look at what is happening in the aid sector right now.

An analysis of those submissions by Andreas Ortmann of Queensland University Of Technology estimates that support for the repeal bill clocks in at fewer than 10 per cent of the submissions. Professor Ortmann also notes it is not quite clear how many of the supportive contributions are commissioned pieces. Some clearly are.

That sounds to me a lot like putting a charities commission inside the tax office. If that is what the minister wants to do he can come clear to the House. Charities rating agencies can play a part. Centres of excellence can play a part—but only if they build on the charities commission, rather than smashing the charities commission. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  The shadow Assistant Treasurer gives a pretty speech, but it is not cognisant of the entire facts—and he never misses a chance to bash the Enlightenment as he goes through. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given his natural instinct for deregulation—he  is an advocate of deregulation in the university sector; he is an advocate of the GP co-payment—I heard his pitch for the Assistant Treasurer's position. He would be welcome as a Liberal Assistant Treasurer in this government with the deregulation views he holds in so many key areas. We will forward his CV to the Prime Minister's office for consideration. You do have a look-in! You will not be ignored with those strong views you have on university deregulation and GP co-payments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that strong deregulatory instinct you have for universities and that strong deregulatory instinct you have for the health sector, why is it that you support so strongly the regulation of the charities sector? The most salient point the member made is that the ACNC has not taken away the functions of the ATO to determine deductible gift-for-recipient status. If you felt so strongly that this was an absolutely necessary regulatory body—the prime body for regulating charities and determining whether they are the recipients of taxpayer funding, in the form of deductible gift recipients—it is still the ATO. That is unchanged from the Labor Party set-up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government had a penchant for red-tape regulation, creating hundreds of new bodies, commissions, positions, audits and reviews. It was their modus operandi. The charity sector and the civil-society sector were no different. This reason for being was the fetish they had for creating new bodies. The ACNC was brought into being to regulate the charity sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the ironies is that in the first proposal of the ACNC it was said that this was going to be a measure to reduce red tape. At the moment, some of the evidence we are receiving is that it is not reducing red tape. We have seen the most recent lodgement rates. About 85 to 90 per cent of charities have lodged their information so far, but about 10 to 15 per cent have not. If you listen to the shadow Assistant Treasurer, you would think there were 50 registered charities and not-for-profits in Australia today. You might think there were 100 people complaining about it. I would educate the assistant shadow Treasurer here. There are 600,000 not-for-profits in Australia today. He read out a list of 20 or 30. It sounds very impressive when you listen to this debate. There are some big players that do that, but there are 600,000 not-for-profits in Australia that are now under this regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party is never cognisant of the difference between large and small. When they make regulation for the business sector, they think business can tolerate it, regardless of whether they are a large business or a small business. It is the coalition—the Liberal and National parties—that understands that small business is the prime mover of the economy. If you make one regulatory change in a macro way, of course big business can handle it, but the small businesses cannot. It is similar in the charity sector. It is not just about the big players and it is not just about the large charities that are well staffed and well-resourced. We want to ensure that civil society is able to function very well, and that means enabling small players as well as large players—people who have the resources to comply with extra red tape and those who do not. The red tape, of course, has to achieve a meaningful purpose. There are 600,000 players out there; 50 in a letter is not representative of 600,000 not-for-profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also add that Pro Bono conceded that they had a non-scientific basis for the survey which the shadow Assistant Treasurer made so much of. The shadow Assistant Treasurer quoted the survey prolifically. On page 7 of their survey report—and they acknowledge the non-scientific basis of their survey—they say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The survey doesn't attempt to be statistically representative of the different stakeholders of that Not For Profit sector …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I praise Pro Bono for that because they are being accurate. They are saying that they are not trying to represent or, in any way, be statistically representative of the sector. They did a survey and, out of 600,000, they had 1,200 respondents. Obviously that is not representative. There was no statistical or scientific method. It could have been representative if conducted in a statistical manner, but it was not. They acknowledge that. The shadow Assistant Treasurer should not act as though that survey by Pro Bono is statistically relevant when the organisation itself acknowledges that it is not. It is quite disingenuous for him to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the bill we have the repeal. I support this agenda, as I have so many times this place, because repealing red tape and regulation is a prime focus of the Abbott coalition government. We have already seen 54,000 pages of legislation removed and $2 billion of compliance removed. Even this morning, I spoke on a bill which removed yet another $500,000 of compliance costs—it was supported by the opposition and I thank them for that—in the building and construction area. It is a prime focus of ours. We can also do this in the charity and not-for-profit sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand there is a view from some of the big players that it is now easier to go to one body—the shadow Assistant Treasurer referred to one-stop shops—and say, 'Is this compliant or not compliant?' and they say yes. However, that does not apply for the entire sector. There are plenty of people who have a different view, major organisations like—and the shadow Assistant Treasurer should not ignore these bodies, especially considering the current debate—Universities Australia, the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes, Catholic Health and the Independent Schools Council of Australia. They all made submissions arguing in favour of the abolition of the ACNC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to not-for-profits in my electorate—often small-scale charities. Small does not mean bad. Small does not mean ineffective. Small does not mean not relevant. There are plenty of niche charities. The point of having charities and not-for-profits is that they act in a fashion that is different to the government. We need our charities so badly in our civil society sector, much more than we need government bureaucrats, because they get more value for the dollar. That is the experience. That is why we have a deductible gift recipient status regime and that is why the government incentivises civil society and charity activity, because it produces greater benefit than armies of bureaucrats—cheaper cost, lower overheads and greater return for the government's work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been a big advocate and fan of many of the Republicans programs in the United States that deliver more government services through acceptable standard charities, because they are so much better at it than having armies of bureaucrats here in Canberra trying to do things on the ground, when you have local community based charities who know their work, know the niche of their work and, indeed, can deliver on it. You could speak to people like Peter Shergold who gave some evidence recently on social bonds that governments are now using to enable more capital to be put into the social services delivery sector. That is new thinking and relevant thinking on better, low-cost ways to deliver government services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Repealing the ACNC is about reducing red tape, reducing regulation and reducing burden on charities and not-for-profits. It may be that some people find the new arrangements acceptable to them, but, overall, I do not believe this will enhance the situation for the vast majority of not-for-profits and, indeed, for the enabling of civil society—a competitive environment where you can get new entrants into civil society. We do not necessarily want to pick the winners and losers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the ATO is still regulating the DGR status, there are other arguments about how these functions could be handled. I accept the view that we could create a centre of excellence which could address flaws in the old model of charity regulation. I quote in particular an article by Helen Rittelmeyer, published in WAtoday.com.au on 20 March 2014, where she argues for centres of excellence that would, rather than simply abolishing the functions of the ACNC or taking away the ATO's responsibilities and giving them to such a new agency—and there is a point to be made about that in a moment—address the concerns of much of the sector without the need for a new heavy-handed regulatory body with the punitive arrangements that it has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that every charity that is going to be more than six months late with its compliance this year will have a statement of noncompliance published on the register. Registration will be revoked if you have not lodged a return for two consecutive years. That all sounds fine in many ways but, of course, we are talking about some very small-scale not-for-profits. I do think there is a heavy hand to government, and I much prefer the incentive based model of government than the punitive model of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was in love with punishment. Its regulation was always punitive. It was heavy-handed and its aim was to crush the sector that it was regulating. Its aim was 'find them, punish them, do not work with them, treat them as the enemy'. You could talk to any sector in the country that survived the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era and all of them would report to you that they felt the government had worked against them in the legislative process. They would get a piece of legislation that they were not consulted on. They struggled to get time to see a minister to get some amendments into the legislation. The regulation would be rushed through. It would be heavy-handed. It would be out of sync with what the industry wanted, or what that sector wanted, and they would have to address a very difficult legislative environment. There is no point talking about the failures of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era. Thankfully, the voters of Australia have consigned that to the dustbin of history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going forward, this was an election commitment. The coalition will keep their election commitments. We opposed it at the time. We are committed, of course, to delivering on this commitment. I support it because, in speaking with those smaller charities and not-for-profits, there is great concern on how to handle this environment. I think the point is intelligent in that a brand-new body like the ACNC does not have a track record in this space. It is now going to have a series of responsibilities that are not even the core functions of regulating the charity and not-for-profit sectors. They do not do the DGR status, which is still in the hands of the ATO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have more regulation, not less. We have more bodies that charities have to deal with, not less. The idea of it being a one-stop shop, as the shadow Assistant Treasurer said, is not one-stop when you have to visit the ATO to get your DGR status and then you have to register with the ACNC. That is actually two stops. The shadow Assistant Treasurer should understand that one-stop shops have not been created in the charity and not-for-profit sector by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government's legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the submissions that Universities Australia and the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes—serious bodies—as well as the Independent Schools Council of Australia provided, you would note that they have some strong views about this regulation abolishing the ACNC, and the benefits that it will provide. There are onerous and duplicative regulatory requirements for charities, and many of them are quite complex. As I said, if you are a big charity, I guess you already have the administrative staff in the front office to deal with this. If you are a smaller charity, the complexity and duplicative requirements are not the language of a one-stop shop. The shadow Assistant Treasurer should understand what a one-stop shop is. It is removing duplicative regulatory requirements, not enabling them. One-stop shops are to reduce complexity, not to increase complexity. The ACNC has increased complexity. It has increased the duplicative regulatory requirements, and that means that it is not a one-stop shop process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the shadow Assistant Treasurer is a great supporter of university deregulation, one-stop shops, environmental approvals, GP co-payments—and I have not got to the rest of the chapters of his book, although he was very good to sign a copy for me—I do urge him to rethink the opposition's approach to this. While we have some parts of the sector saying that this is fantastic because we have the capacity to deal with it, we also want to enable civil society, as it has been for many, many years now, to do the best that it can and that means there has to be differences of scale. With 600,000 not-for-profits, it means there will be a variety of size and scale and outcome. Of course, I do not believe that that means we should have fewer not-for-profits or fewer people involved in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This repeal bill, I think, is a good start to ensuring that we have less complexity and less duplicative requirements. If you speak to different parts of the sector you will get different responses about how this should be handled. That does not mean the government should err from the course of their election commitment to reduce red tape and reduce regulatory requirements. There will be no ill effect on any of these not-for-profits by us abolishing the ACNC. There will be no diminution of their capacity. There will be no financial penalty. There will be no lessening of their work or their scope. In fact, we will be giving the opportunity to do more, and we will be freeing up many smaller players to be able to get on with that work, which we want them doing, which is making our society a better place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I speak in support of the amendment of the shadow Assistant Treasurer in opposing the legislation before the chamber that the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, the ACNC, be abolished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke in relation to the legislation establishing the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission on 11 September 2012, I referred to the submission to the Senate Economics Committee by Dr Matthew Turnour, an expert in the area of not-for-profit law and regulation and a director of the Australian Charity Law Association. He quoted English academic Jonathan Edward Garton's book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">egulation of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">harities and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ivil </span><span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ociety</span>, in identifying six overlapping grounds justifying the regulation of not-for-profit organisations. They include the following: preventing anticompetitive practices; controlling campaigning; ensuring trustworthiness; coordinating the sector; rectifying philanthropic failures; and preventing challenges to organisational quiddity. Dr Turnour, and others who have been quoted by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, are in support of the ACNC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, Colombo and Hall, in writing in relation to the laws and regulations concerning charities, have pointed out that in ancient Greece, ancient Rome and ancient Egypt there was regulation in respect of charities and, indeed, evidence of tax favourability. In the UK, since legislation introduced by William Pitt in relation to income taxation, there have been exemptions for the benefit of the not-for-profit sector. When I spoke on 11 September 2012 I actually said that I doubted if those opposite—the now government and the then opposition—would actually attempt to overturn this legislation, and I admit that I was wrong. It is something that the Prime Minister can barely bring himself to admit in relation to his broken promises. I was wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did not think that the government would actually do this, because the sector is overwhelmingly in support of the ACNC. Pro Bono Australia surveyed their people—and in fact, there were 154 submissions to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry that are available on the inquiry's website—and reported that more than 80 per cent supported the ACNC. The member for Mitchell is wrong, in that respect, to cast doubt in relation to Pro Bono Australia's work. Curiously, it also reported that, of the 13 organisations and individuals who were invited to give evidence at the inquiry's public hearing, more than half supported the repeal of the ACNC Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government really does not care to listen to the voices of the sector and those who donate their time, money and effort to it, who want accountability and transparency. The Abbott government does not care that the ACNC is already cleaning up the sector, revoking the charity status of more than 240 organisations this year and moving towards deregistering another 3,500. This government does not care that, according to evidence given in estimates in October, the ACNC cost just $15 million annually, but it saves Australian charities $120 million annually in compliance costs. I will repeat that: it costs $15 million annually but saves Australian charities $120 million annually in compliance costs. So much for this legislation actually reducing the burdens and costs on the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does not care that it seeks to return the regulation of charities to the ATO after it has already cut 3,000 ATO tax experts through its actions. The government does not care and does not consult. When it does, it does not listen to the sector. Its intention is to abolish the ACNC. It is an insult to the work of the not-for-profit sector and it will cause chaos in the sector. As the Community Council of Australia has warned, abolishing the ACNC would be a clear sign that the government is not interested in the views of the sector. Of course, it reeks of ideology surrounding its decision. That has not gone unnoticed in the sector. The St Vincent de Paul Society told the recent Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill that it is wary of what appears to be an ideological opposition to the very existence of the ACNC. We agree with the St Vincent de Paul Society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government's mistreatment of the sector stands in contrast to the consultative and collaborative way we approached the sector in government. We understood that the sector is vitally important to the nation's economy and the health of every Australian community. According to the latest ABS data, about 600,000 organisations make up the not-for-profit sector. Of these, almost 60,000 are economically active, employing more than a million Australians and contributing $54 billion annually to the economy. A further five million people volunteer in the sector, contributing $15 billion in unpaid work. The government has not paid this sector respect. It plans to kill off the ACNC despite the overwhelming support of the sector for the ACNC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uniting Church told the recent Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiring into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Church was surprised that the current Federal Government wished to abolish the Commission and to separate various aspects, functions and roles of the current Commission which effectively threatens the benefits of one body being responsible for all. Additionally, we struggle to ascertain what will be the successor bodies, their roles and responsibilities, and how they will better benefit the sector and the Federal, State and Territory Governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Council of Social Services told the same inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is unusual for an industry to be championing regulation. However, as the recipient of ineffective regulation for many years, the Australian NFP sector recognises the value of an effective, sector-centred, streamlined and proportionate regulatory regime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector supports the ACNC because it spent 20 years advocating for a single-point, sector-centred national regulator. It was crying out for the harmonisation of the fragmented regulation under which it operated. That is why it supported it. The sector understands that these regulations require structured reform—reform which was wholeheartedly supported by both the 2010 Productivity Commission report commissioned by the then Labor government and the Henry tax review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission found that the not-for-profit sector faced an ad hoc regulatory regime—a dog's breakfast, would be more accurate. The sector was regulated by 180 pieces of Commonwealth, state and territory legislation and 19 separate agencies. Labor was the party that established the ACNC to streamline the regulation of the not-for-profit sector. The Productivity Commission described the situation as 'an unnecessarily complex, confused and costly regulatory environment'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We listened to the sector and we established the ACNC. It has already reduced some of the duplication that can arise in our federal system. The ACNC administers a charity passport based on a 'report once, use often' framework. In consultation with other reforms which we brought in, a passport will reduce the amount of time charities and the not-for-profits will spend filling out forms and will allow them to spend more time working in their communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACT and South Australia will exempt nationally registered charities from having to register in their jurisdiction. We on this side of the chamber are concerned that the government's abolition of the ACNC will weaken transparency and accountability in the sector—transparency which has significantly increased through the creation of the ACNC's national register of Australian charities and not-for-profits. As of today, that website has almost 60,000 charities and not-for-profits on its register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, it is freely available to the public to peruse. Anyone can check the register for details of a purported charity, including its ABN, its charitable status, where it operates and the services it provides. The ACNC register makes it easier for people considering donating their time and money and effort to a charity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent search of the ACNC register shows that it lists 241 charities and not-for-profits active in my electorate of Blair, within the 4304, 4305 and 4306 postcodes. They include Choices Family Day Care; Ipswich Hospice Care; the 24/7 Cycling Safety Fund; Hannah's House; Kambu; Focal Extended; Ipswich Assist; IRASI; the Whitehill Church Of Christ; the Pine Mountain Rural Fire Brigade and the Ipswich Women's Centre Against Domestic Violence. And many of those organisations were actually at my Blair Disability Links event last Friday, 28 November, in which over 40 service providers participated, where I relaunched the information booklet. I am pleased to see so many of those organisations present there listed on the ACNC Register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of those organisations work in my electorate and some of them work also outside it, but often they face cuts at the hands of the Campbell Newman LNP Queensland state government. And they are now facing the attitude taken by this government, here in this chamber—they are not listening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do for this sector is to support it. Protection is provided by and available through the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, which clamps down on fraudulent behaviours—though, thankfully, they are rare. In its first year of operation, the ACNC received 202 complaints against charities, including 48 for fraud or criminal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as the shadow Assistant Treasurer pointed out, it is also engaged in an Indigenous communities engagement strategy. And, as the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, I am pleased to see that the ACNC has employed two Aboriginal liaison officers who can provide help to those clients who are of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, in those community-controlled services, because it is important to provide those, to end disadvantage, and it is important to improve closing the gap activities, and many of these not-for-profits are involved in such activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But where does this come from? This comes from the attitude of the current government—despite the fact that they will not listen to the Community Council for Australia; they will not listen to ACOSS; they will not listen to the Law Council of Australia; they will not listen to Legacy Australia Council; they will not listen to the Breast Cancer Network Australia; and they will not even listen to the Uniting Church in relation to this. Where does it come from? It seems to come from the attitude of the Minister for Social Services. I refer to a speech he made at the Aon Breakfast Forum on 30 April, subsequent, by the way, to the legislation being introduced in this chamber—and it has been in this House for such a long time, I wondered what they were going to do. He seems to rely on a 1942 report, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the inter-departmental committee on social insurance and allied services</span>, better known as the Beveridge report, which talked about the 'giant evils' of society—squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease—as if, somehow, that report, of 1942, was that which we had to follow. No-one in this chamber, I think, would be against getting rid of squalor, ignorance, want, idleness or disease, but simply to be committed to this sort of approach seems out of date, conservative and as if not listening to modern Australian needs. It is certainly not listening to the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is interesting is that he says in that speech, 'Government doesn't have all the answers.' Seriously, I do not think that anyone in Australia believes that government, or any organisation, individual, company or not-for-profit has all the answers. But, of the Abbott government, the minister said in that speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ours is a Government steeped in a humble awareness of its imprecise knowledge and imperfect capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What an interesting comment, in view of the 'barnacles' they are trying to get rid of at the moment. But it is an interesting attitude to take—it is a 1942 attitude that the minister seems to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the minister is yet to reveal anything about what will replace the ACNC. In a speech in January this year, he referred to a national centre of excellence, which would act as a sort of fount of innovation and advocacy. It sounds a bit fluffy, if you ask me; it sounds as fluffy as the Treasurer's and the health minister's medical research fund. And he talked, in the media reports, about a US based charity evaluator called the Charity Navigator, which simply rates charities but has no power to intervene as a regulator. Indeed, the charity regulators in the USA are looking to replicate our successful ACNC. So I am very curious about what the government is going to do about this, should this legislation actually get through both the House and the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we will not sit idly by while this government tears down the ACNC and removes the only pathway to guaranteeing a transparent and accountable Australian not-for-profit sector. So we will oppose this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M2X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">WYATT ROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill 2014. This bill seeks to implement the government's election commitment to abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, or ACNC. The commission was established under the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012 and began on 3 December 2012 with legislation introduced by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposition, we opposed the formation of this new charities regulator—and for very good reason. It is yet another classic red-tape case of a heavy and entirely unnecessary compliance burden making life much more difficult for that key plank of civil society, our charities. Our red-tape demolition agenda, driven by the member for Kooyong and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, has crossed out more than $2.1 billion worth of redundant, overbearing and obstructionist legislation and regulation. That is double our target for this year. And this repeal is another important component of that agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party dreamed up the ACNC because it did not trust the charitable sector. Their distrust saw Labor once again reaching for their notorious hair trigger on regulation. The coalition government sees things quite differently. We are most reticent to put government and bureaucracy in the way of the functioning, cohesive social order that should underpin our communities. By definition, civil society is that sphere of action sitting between the state, the market and everyday households. It is a space where NGOs and the wider community can realise change through campaigns, voluntary activities and other forms of assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Civil society includes the charitable sector. We, on this side of the House trust our charities and the not-for-profit organisations. Why? Because we believe, and know, that the charitable sector comprises largely good, unselfish and principled people volunteering their time, effort and even financial resources to performing often exceptional deeds on behalf of their communities. These inspiring people—and I celebrate them every year locally with my Longman awards—deserve nothing less than a presumption that honour and integrity is implicit in the work that they do. Labor's instinctive approach, however, was to drag them under the lens of government regulation. That is because Labor established the ACNC on the premise that Australian charities and the not-for-profits were doing something inherently wrong and required muscled-up government oversight. This government utterly rejects that assumption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of states have not even signed over their powers to the ACNC, accentuating the onerous and duplicative regulatory environment for charities. At the same time, wide support for the abolition of the ACNC has come from major entities across Australia such as Universities Australia, the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes, Catholic Health and the Independent Schools Council of Australia plus, countless local charities that I have spoken to in my community. This is a repeal that the not-for- profits and charities sector clearly want. Members opposite are shaking their heads, but I would encourage them to do what I have done and go out and talk to the local charities that face this unnecessary regulatory and compliance burden in the bills that we are seeking to repeal here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government introduced the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No 1) Bill on our March repeal day as part of a two-stage legislative process to terminate Labor's large and ungainly new super regulator for charities and not-for-profits. By abolishing the ACNC, we deliver on our commitment to reduce complexity for charities and not-for-profits, helping them to get on with the integral work they do. Contrary to what those on the other side of this chamber may put around, I can inform the House that the coalition has consulted extensively on this policy agenda with hundreds of sector stakeholders both before and after last year's federal election. We first declared in September 2012 our intention to abolish the ACNC. So Labor's claim that there has been inadequate time and room for discussion in this public arena is a blatant falsehood. The government has already delivered greater certainty to civil society with our reform to grant and contracting arrangements. Our provision for longer contracting periods has increased confidence for social service providers in their planning of leases, operational and staffing matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let there be no mistake: the government values the dedicated service and contribution that civil society injects locally, nationally and internationally. It is important work. Through the mechanisms of civil society, communities develop identity and build resilience. As Australians, lending a helping hand to those in need is in our DNA. In Longman, I have launched a drive to boost my community's volunteer army at the click of a button with the 'Do Something Near You' portal on my website. 'Do Something Near You' is a breakthrough in online volunteering. It is the brainchild of the not-for-profit organisation Do Something, whose creators include Planet Ark founders Jon Dee and former tennis champion Pat Cash. In my electorate, this service enables volunteers to sign up for their local SES or rural fire service, donate blood to the Red Cross, assist the RSPCA, join their local Rotary or Lions Club, or help out with myriad other projects and organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, our volunteering rates compare favourably with other nations, with more than a third of the adult population involved. But, obviously, that still leaves a lot of room for improvement. While most people will tell you they have thought about volunteering, busy lives often mean that they never quite get around to it. Research shows volunteers enjoy an increased sense of community belonging and often a lift in their physical and mental wellbeing. The economic impact of Australia's volunteer workforce is about $18 billion a year. All of this points to why the coalition government is determined to help, not hinder, civil society. Instead of making it easier for civil society, the ACNC has made it harder—increasing and duplicating regulatory burdens, which in the end discourage involvement in voluntary and community endeavour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current legislation—which I might add was rushed through this parliament by the former Labor government in cahoots with the Independents and Greens here in the House and the Greens in the Senate—the ACNC requires charities to produce more information for yet another agency of government, along with heightened reporting requirements. It is a fact that many Australians would not be aware that the ACNC has been given more power than the regulators of the corporate sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In place of the ACNC, the government will establish a new centre for excellence with ownership transitioning to the sector itself. The new centre will focus on education, innovation and training within the charities sector. It will advocate for and empower our charities and not-for-profits. In other words, the centre for excellence will be in the sector, of the sector and for the sector. This government is committed to providing real support to civil society via cutting red tape, simplifying reporting requirements and granting greater certainty through streamlined contracting arrangements. Rather than the heavy-handed, coercive regulatory approach of the ACNC, we believe in our charities and their honourable stated goals around improving the lives of their fellow citizens. These sterling people deserve our gratitude and they deserve our faith. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  Just listening to contributions of members opposite in relation to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill leads me to ask: what parallel universe do members opposite actually occupy here? The self-delusion that this bill is somehow in keeping with the key lines issued in today's briefings to members opposite where they are meant to sing the praises of their year of achievements is part of an utterly desperate attempt to override or reboot what has been nothing but a shocking year for this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, tonight I do wish to join with my Labor colleagues on this side of the House in opposition to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill. The proposal to abolish the commission is ill-considered, unpopular and should be dumped. The commission was established by Labor, in 2012, following an extensive 15-year period of review and consultation. It was established for the right reasons and it had been doing exactly what it was set up to do, operating efficiently and effectively to assist charities, donors and taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite simply, the government's plan to abolish the commission is an insult to the good work of the charitable sector and to all Australians who want accountability and transparency when it comes to their generous donations. The government, led by the Minister for Social Services, has pledged to scrap the commission on the grounds that requiring charities to report on their financial and corporate operations is somehow just simply red tape. The government plans to return responsibility for regulating charities to the Australian tax office, at the same time that it is sacking more than 4,700 staff from this agency, including many from my electorate of Newcastle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian not-for-profit sector generates income of approximately $100 billion a year and employs over 900,000 Australians. Before the establishment of the commission, there was no dedicated regulator for this significant segment of the Australian economy. There are no reasonable grounds to scrap the commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Economics Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into the ACNC Repeal Bill in June 2014. Of the 155 charities and other organisations which made a submission to that inquiry, over 80 per cent supported retaining the charities commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">True to form, however, this government rejects all the evidence before us and pursues its own narrow ideological agenda or that of the somewhat uncharitable IPA instead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission is protecting Australians from charity scammers by requiring not-for-profits to report annually on their financial activities and creating a searchable register so that people can quickly check the bona fides of an organisation before donating money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the commission has registered 59,697 charities on the online register. It has also pursued legal action against four dodgy charities for ripping off donors and has revoked the charity status of over 700 more organisations for failing to report on their annual activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to evidence given at estimates, in October 2014, the ACNC saves Australian charities $120 million a year by reducing compliance costs and red tape. An independent study by Ernst &amp; Young confirmed that the ACNC significantly reduced the reporting burden for charities, leaving them more time to focus on helping Australian communities. The report noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A core component of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission's reporting framework and efforts around reducing red tape is the "report once, use often" principle. This principle is consistent with recommendations issued by the Productivity Commission, the National Commission of Audit, the Australian National Audit Office, the Treasury and the Department of Finance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014 Pro Bono Australia 'State of the Sector' survey found that 82 per cent of respondents believe the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission is important, or extremely important, for the thriving not-for-profit sector. That is consistent with the 83 per cent of respondents who backed the commission in the 2013 survey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only six per cent of those surveyed agreed with Minister Kevin Andrews that the Australian tax office should resume responsibility for regulating charities. That is exactly the same figure contained in the 2013 Pro Bono survey. That is a massive 94 per cent endorsement of the current arrangements under the commission. Charities support the commission, the Australian public recognise the need for the commission and the governance role it plays is vital in regulating a very large sector within Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, some of Australia's most well-established and respected charities felt so strongly about the issues that they took the very courageous step of publishing an open letter, urging the government to reconsider their push to abolish the commission before the Senate inquiry was launched. Charities such as Lifeline, ACOSS, Save the Children, the RSPCA, Youth Off the Streets, World Vision, St John Ambulance Australia, the McGrath Foundation and Wesley Mission Australia are among those who signed the letter and called on the government to keep the commission. In their letter to the Prime Minister, these charities argued their case succinctly. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We want to make it very clear to the Commonwealth Government and wider community that like most charities across Australia, we value the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, and we want to see it continue its impressive work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="page-break-after:avoid;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACNC has done what few new regulators achieve—gained widespread support across the sector it is regulating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are strong words that should be taken heed of. As mentioned, the majority of submissions to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill supported the commission and its regulatory role. In their submission, the Law Council of Australia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ('ACNC') is the body most appropriate to determine the charitable status of entities that are seeking tax concessions under the Federal tax legislation and to regulate them thereafter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current bill seeks to repeal the ACNC ... The society opposes this move. The society, while believing that there is much to be gained from a constructive and critical engagement in ensuring that the ACNC fulfils its role, is opposed to this bill and is wary of what appears to be an ideological opposition to the very existence of the ACNC.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just two of the many, many comments supporting the role of the commission that were made before the Senate inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The charities and not-for-profit sector plays a vital role in our community, contributing both economically and socially. Importantly, the sector employs more than one million Australians, turns over around $100 billion per annum, involves almost five million volunteers    and nurtures and supports all of our communities—including my community of Newcastle. According to the commission's charity register, the Newcastle electorate is home to more than 450 registered charities—that is, 450 organisations, large and small, doing great things to support local communities in Newcastle. None is more important or less important than the others—from the Dixon Park Surf Life Saving Club, which supports our young nippers, to homelessness support organisations such as the Samaritans, to disability service providers such as Connectability or any one of my 65 local P&amp;C groups. Charities support the whole of our community, not just the vulnerable. And charities need the support of a strong, dedicated regulator—a job the commission is doing aptly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important role the commission plays is in helping to reduce and eliminate scammers. At a time when so many Australians are being exposed to any number of increasingly sophisticated scams, we need the commission to help protect both the registered charities and members of the public who donate their hard-earned money to worthy causes. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's <span style="font-style:italic;">Little Black Book of Scams</span> details the situation well. Scammers will try anything to get our money. Charity scams, in particular, are not uncommon. They misdirect money away from legitimate, registered charitable organisations and into the pockets of scammers. Common tactics include exploiting natural disasters and crises in the news to collect funds, masquerading as a charity worker or creating a fictitious charity to fool people into making donations. They are usually scams that play on emotions, looking to collect for a cause that will likely secure sympathy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same way that ASIC provides investors with the confidence they need to buy shares in companies, the commission provides donors with the confidence that registered charities are actually performing genuinely charitable works. The Abbott Liberal government might want us to believe that the ACNC is yet another example of government over-reaching, of involving itself where it is not needed or wanted, and adding to the so-called burden of red tape. But it is worth asking: not wanted by whom? Fake charities? Money launderers? Tax evaders? Dodgy operators? Conmen? This government, the IPA and its financial backers may not want the commission but most Australian charities and not-for-profits do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We might also ask: who in the charitable industry was consulted on these proposed changes? In response to a question on notice asking for details of who has been involved in consultations about what might replace the commission, the minister responsible listed 31 people representing 23 organisations. Curiously, some on the minister's list do not believe that they were in fact consulted. They have written to the shadow Assistant Treasurer noting their concern that the minister has sought to mislead the public about their involvement in consultations with his personal staff and the Department of Social Services. One correspondent wrote: 'It was in no way a consultation and I will write to the DSS and the Senate committee to have my name removed from the list as I was not consulted in any other forum or at any other time.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government hiding behind an illusion of consultation to ram home an ideological agenda. As the Community Council of Australia has warned, abolishing the commission would be a sign that the government is not interested in the views of the charity sector. It would harm charities, who will lose visibility and governance support. And it would be bad for the public, who will be more exposed to fraud and scams. It has been exactly one year since the Minister for Social Services stood up in this place and committed to sending the charities commission to the chopping block. Time has not improved this bill. Labor will stand against the government's attempts to scrap transparency and accountability in the not-for-profit sector and strongly oppose this bill. I call on the government to abandon their ludicrous plans to axe the commission and to instead better support Australian charities in the great work they are doing in our communities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="217266" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill 2014. The abolition of this bill will remove the red tape that was strangling the efforts of, and making life harder for, the many volunteers who devote their time to bettering the lives of others. I would just like to touch on a few points about the importance of charities and not-for-profits in our community. Charities and not-for-profits are vital to civil society. They not only contribute to the general wellbeing of communities by lending a helping hand to those in need but also generate a significant amount of money for Australia. In fact, charities and not-for-profit organisations generate about five per cent of the national economy. They provide as many as one million paid positions—that is, one in twelve of the nation's jobs. Charities and not-for-profit organisations involve more than six million volunteers—a wage equivalent of $15 billion each year. Overall they provide annual revenue of about $100 billion to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to add even more regulation to the running of these organisations was an absurd decision. All it has done is create a burden that would discourage involvement in our many thousands of volunteer organisations. The former government's introduction of this bill showed disrespect for these organisations and was based on the unfair delusion that all charities need to be policed. While the former government might have held this opinion, it is not the case for the Australian public. Australians have long demonstrated a strong trust in the not-for-profit and charity sector by international standards. Not only do we have a high level of volunteering and charitable giving occurring nationally, but in 2013 we were ranked the Most Generous Country by the Charities Aid Foundation's World Giving Index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Charities and not-for-profit organisations play a vital role in civil society and work hard to gain the public's trust. Indeed, these days there is a healthy competition for donations, and this—not legislation—is what will encourage further giving. They do not need to be burdened with even more regulations; they need to be able to devote more time to outreach services and more time to doing what they do best. The abolition of this bill is consistent with the coalition government's broader deregulation agenda and will remove excessive, unnecessary and overly complex red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Ryan I see firsthand the amazing work that is accomplished by charities and not-for-profit groups. Just recently I attended Party in the Paddock, a celebration for the 50th anniversary of the McIntyre Centre, which provides equestrian programs for young people with disabilities. The centre has the outstanding support of the community. Together they raised $50,000 at this one event, all of which will go towards helping more than 200 young people. These 200 people would not have access to such specialised programs without the help of the McIntyre Centre and its tireless volunteers. Volunteers are essential to the running of the McIntyre Centre. Without them, the centre could be forced to turn away children who would thrive in these programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another not-for-profit organisation in my electorate is the Picabeen Community Centre, in the heart of Mitchelton. They have for many years run programs ranging from legal help to play groups and tutoring for schoolchildren and literacy courses for adults and have provided counselling services and computer access. They also run Clothesline, an initiative for women who suffer from sexual and domestic violence. In their 2014 report their president affirms just how vital volunteers are to the success of this organisation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without the volunteers Picabeen Community Association would not be able to offer the activities and services that it offers and it would not be able to fundraise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McIntyre Centre and Picabeen are just two organisations of many in Ryan that would not be able to provide support to the most vulnerable in our community without their volunteers. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission, and the regulations that come with it, creates an extra burden to these special organisations—a burden that could discourage involvement altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These organisations need our support. They need less red tape and they need less regulations so that they can focus their attention on supporting our most vulnerable. The work these organisations do for our community is second to none, and it is important that they are respected. That is why, in place of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, the government will establish a centre for excellence. This small body will promote innovation, education and training. It will empower the sector and allow for advocacy, meaning that the people inside the sector will have a say in what happens within it The introduction of a centre for excellence will allow charities and not-for-profits to focus all their attention on the important outreach work they do, not on complex internal paperwork.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is committed to delivering more certainty in the civil sector, reducing complexities and reforming grant and contract arrangements. The coalition government wholeheartedly values the service and contributions that charities and not-for-profits provide to the Australian public, and we will honour our election promise to abolish this commission to give the power back to the sector. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  The bill before the House concerns  the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, which was founded in 2012 by the Labor government. This bill—the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal Day) (No. 1) Bill 2014—seeks to abolish it, and that is nothing short of an act of legislative vandalism. Why? Because the commission actually has broad support within the community that it seeks to regulate, and that is not a common thing amongst the regulated. It has broad support amongst the charities and not-for-profits sector, a very important sector of our community and of our economy. It generates an income of approximately $100 billion a year and employs close to a million Australians. In some communities, the charities and not-for-profit sector is one of the largest employers in town. The sector runs organisations as diverse as community housing, emergency housing shelters, recycling and printing, disability enterprises, coffee shops, soup kitchens, employment agencies, environment protection groups, researchers and think tanks—the list goes on. But one thing that has united them all is their opposition to what the government is doing with this bill before the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The not-for-profit sector was regulated at the federal level principally by the Australian Taxation Office. Those in the sector had relationships, if they were funded by the Commonwealth government, with all the funding agencies in relation to those funding programs. Despite all the reporting requirements in each Australian jurisdiction, there were public reporting obligations for the non-for-profit sector. So, we needed to have a look at this. And whilst Labor holds in very high regard the great work of the Australian Taxation Office and the men and women who work there, often under great pressure, there was a belief that there was a conflict of interest at times regarding the role of the ATO in determining the charitable status of organisations they would otherwise be collecting revenue from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also a problem with the absence of uniform reporting arrangements, which meant a lack of transparency and accountability. Much of their time is not spent on charitable works, but in fact on reporting to local, state and Commonwealth governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor decided to clean up this mess in response to the calls from the not-for-profit sector that they were spending too much of their valuable time not dealing with their main mission, the charity and not-for-profit work, but complying with government regulations, it was not a capricious act of Canberra-based centralism, as many previous speakers have attempted to characterise it. It was actually the continuation of a long line of thought that spanned over successive governments. Inquiries commissioned by several governments had recommended the establishment of just such a regulator. Regrettably, successive governments did not implement the recommendations of those reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, in 2001 the Howard government commissioned an inquiry into the charities and related organisations. It recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Government consider establishing a comprehensive national administrative framework for the charitable and related sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again in 2008, the Senate Economics Committee inquired into the disclosure regimes for the not-for-profits and recommended that there be a single independent national regulator for not-for-profit organisations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving forward to 2010, the Henry review found that a national charities commission should be established to monitor, regulate and provide advice to all not-for-profit organisations. In that same year, the Productivity Commission recommended the establishment of a one-stop shop for Commonwealth regulation and tax endorsement of the not-for-profit sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquired into the Tax Laws Amendment (Public Benefit Test) Bill in 2010. Again, it recommended that the way to improve transparency in the sector was to establish a single independent national commission for not-for-profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission was not an accidental creation. It was not conceived of one night in an office around this place and rushed through the parliament. In fact it was the subject of successive government inquiries spanning almost a decade and half, and careful consideration and careful consultation with the sector. Indeed, I sat on the House economics committee which inquired into the original bill that was put before the House, and we responded to a number of the issues that were raised by those within the sector. It was against this background that so many within the sector said, 'This is a good idea: it deserves our support.' Far from scrapping it now, it should be allowed to be bedded in, expanded and allowed to do its work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACNC protects Australians in many ways and it helps to regulate the sector. For example, it protects against charity scammers, who use Australians' goodwill towards charities and the desire by most Australians to do the right thing by the not-for-profit and the charity sector. It protects against those who would seek to abuse that sentiment within the Australian public for scamming purposes by requiring not-for-profits to report annually on their financial activities and creating a searchable register so that people can quickly check the credentials of charities before making a donation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its short period of operation, the commission has registered almost 60,000 charities on its online register and commenced legal action against charities who were found to be ripping off unsuspecting donors. It has also revoked the charitable status of over 700 organisations for failing to report their annual activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year the Senate estimates heard that the ACNC saves Australian charities around $120 million a year by reducing the red tape and compliance costs that would otherwise be visited upon them. Indeed, Ernst &amp; Young conducted an independent study which confirmed that the ACNC significantly reduced the reporting burden for charities, leaving them more time to focus on their charitable activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle, which was at the heart of the establishment of the ACNC, was that they adopt the 'report once and use often' principle. This was a response from many within the sector who say they spend so much of their time providing the same information not only to various levels of government but to various departments within the same level of government. Apply for this; comply with this regulation; fill in this form—completely duplicating the information that is collected between one department and another. So the ACNC adopted the 'report once and use often' principle, and it is working.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014 Pro Bono Australia conducted the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the Not for Profit Sector Survey</span>, which found that 82 per cent of respondents believe the ACNC is important or extremely important for creating a vibrant not-for-profit sector. Only six per cent of respondents agreed with Minister Kevin Andrews that the ATO should resume responsibility—which is exactly what is being proposed by the bill before the House. That is, 94 per cent think it is working well—it is either important or extremely important to the sector; six per cent are nay-sayers. Yet the minister chooses to act on the advice of the six per cent and not the 94 per cent. Is it any wonder that the government finds itself in so much trouble when you consider that this is the way they respond to regulating the sector. Responsible governments will listen to the community, they will listen to the industry that they are seeking to regulate and work with, and they will respond. But it would appear this government is doing exactly the opposite.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You are about my vintage, Mr Deputy Speaker Whiteley, so you would probably recall that a Bulgarian-born installation artist by the name of Christo made a visit to Australia in 1969. He made a bit of a hit of himself by wrapping Little Bay near Sydney. He entirely wrapped it up in paper and plastic. That was one of his first installations. He has travelled the world since then.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have got a say that if Christo ever wants to revisit Australia then he could find a great collaborative partner in the Christo from Kooyong because we have heard great speeches from the Christo from Kooyong, the parliamentary secretary Josh Frydenberg, when he introduced into this place the red tape repeal day legislation. He had some pretty fine things to say about the importance of removing red tape. He said that when they came to government they committed to cut $1 billion a year in red tape. They said that regulation will no longer be the default action of government. It will only be a means of last resort after every other avenue is exhausted. So you have got to ask yourself: what is going through the mind of the Christo from Kooyong in repealing the very piece of legislation which is designed to remove red tape from the charities and not-for-profit sector?</span>

They are telling us that they were drowning in red tape, drowning in compliance burden. There was more tape, more wrapping, than a Christo installation. What is the government's answer to this problem? Instead of supporting and enhancing the functions of the ACNC—the report once, use often principle—they abolish that and go back to the bad old days where the great people in the charities and not-for-profit sector, instead of spending all their time doing the great work in the community, are now going to be forced to spend a great deal of their time on a compliance burden which is entirely unnecessary. It is why we say this is an act of vandalism, and those on the other side ought to think again. The bill should be rejected.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  It is hard to believe that members opposite would argue that the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profit Commission (ACNC) Repeal Bill 2014 would actually result in more red tape when the ACNC, when it was introduced by members on the opposite side in the then government, the Labor government, actually introduced another layer of bureaucracy. What has happened and what we have seen happen since is that other layers of bureaucracy in the states are still requiring charitable organisations to provide them with reporting and information which, in fact, provides other layers of bureaucracy. So this bill today is another product of this government's determination to deliver on its election commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposition the coalition opposed the establishment of the ACNC because it imposed an unnecessary compliance burden on very vital sections of our civil society. The abolition of the ACNC is an election commitment that this government intends to fulfil. Labor set up the ACNC because it did not trust the charitable sector. We believe that the charitable sector is composed, by and large, of good people, many volunteering and donating their time, their effort and their finances to make a significant contribution and a difference not just in the local communities but in this nation and often in nations that are vulnerable around the globe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government takes the approach that the charitable sector can be relied upon, that the charitable sector has a determination to manage itself responsibly according to the highest standards. Not-for-profit organisations are geared towards providing essential services to the community—not profit. Moreover, states have not relinquished their responsibility to regulate the charitable sector to the ACNC. Consequently, the bulk of charities are subjected to regulatory requirements from more than one jurisdiction. For charitable organisations that operate across the whole of the nation this is multiplied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The abolition of the ACNC is also an important component of our red-tape reduction agenda that will lessen the regulatory compliance burden on charities. In June 2013, when the Charities Bill 2013, along with the Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, was introduced to this parliament, I spoke against its adoption. I stood before this parliament and declared that the bill would not benefit charities. Labor's charities bill sought to change the public's understanding of charities to conform with their distrust of the sector's capabilities and their disbelief that the sector could conduct itself honestly. I would like to remind the House of the definition of charities; a definition that is unilaterally understood. The definition of charities is 400 years old. Common law has served us well. Since Federation, the definition of charity has remained clear and consistent. It has remained a cornerstone of what constitutes charitable endeavour and what constitutes charitable activity in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government pushed through the legislation that triggered suspicion and mistrust of this essential sector of civil society. Labor is accusing this government of not seeking thorough enough consultation with the sector before the consideration of this bill. May I remind the members opposite that the public consultation phase on the draft definition of the words 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' presented by the previous Labor government was open to consultation for less than four weeks. Apparently, Labor thought they knew better than 400 years of history and simultaneously thought nothing of redefining definitions that have served the sector so well. Why depart from 400 years of clarity and consistency?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I clarified to the parliament at the time that the coalition would seek to repeal this bill if elected. The government is committed to community consultation, and we take seriously the importance of empowering the charitable sector within our society. The charitable sector itself has, at its heart, the goal and the purpose of empowering those they serve to overcome barriers and disadvantage, thereby enabling the most vulnerable in our society to fulfil their potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2012, the coalition first announced its intention to abolish the ACNC, and Minister Andrews has discussed this policy agenda with hundreds of sector's stakeholders, both before and after the September 2013 election. Therefore, the government rejects Labor's argument that there has been inadequate consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Support for ACNC abolition from such organisations as Universities Australia and the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes demonstrates that the government's civil society agenda enjoys wide support in the not-for-profit charities sector. In its submission to the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into ACNC repeal bill, Universities Australia made clear their view:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">No public interest objective is advanced by the ACNC, imposing additional governance standards obligations on the university sector, which is already more thoroughly and comprehensively regulated by another government agency—the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes, AAMRI, also expressed concerns with regard to the ACNC Act:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACNC Act has not been successful in consolidating and streamlining financial reporting requirements … AAMRI contends that the ACNC charity passport, which aims to reduce duplicative reporting across federal, state and territory legislatures, is unlikely to work to significant benefit</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's commitment to the people of Australia is to abolish the ACNC, which represents another strand in the pile of Labor red tape that is being systematically and methodically eliminated by the coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been the intention of this government for some time. This is not a new initiative. The government introduced the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill 2014 on repeal day in March as part of a two-stage legislative process leading to the abolition of Labor's superfluous regulations for charities and not-for-profits. We have been up-front about this. The ACNC has introduced a new and unnecessary layer of administration, duplicating regulatory requirements for charities with those already imposed by states. The ACNC has established a new reporting framework that requires all registered charities to provide an annual information statement. Charities continue to be regulated by the respective state and territory authority, both if they are an incorporated association or an unincorporated body. The legislation to create the ACNC was rushed through parliament by Labor and the Independents in the House, and then by Labor and the Greens in the Senate. By abolishing the ACNC, the coalition will deliver on our commitment to reduce complexity for charities and not-for-profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's approach to the charitable sector is based on the belief that Australian charities and not-for-profit organisations strengthen our nation through their contribution to communities right across Australia. We are not going to hinder that with unnecessary regulation. We will establish a new National Centre for Excellence, with ownership transitioning to the sector. The centre will focus on education, innovation and training, and it will work to advocate for and empower the sector to achieve the outcomes that they identify as vital for the communities and people they serve.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government values the dedicated service and contribution that civil society provides locally, nationally and internationally. We believe it is vital that we empower this sector. We understand that the charitable sector plays a role and fills a gap that the government never could.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before entering parliament, I worked as a social worker for some 25 years. My work meant I was on the ground seeing firsthand the work of the charitable sector. The many organisations that make up the charitable sector are trusted pillars in the community. There are the Red Cross, St Vincent de Paul, the Wesley Mission and the many not-for-profit small organisations that work on a daily basis for the most vulnerable in our community. There are other charitable organisations, like Sydney City Mission, who work for the homeless, Heed the Cry Appeal, and Blue Mountains Cancer Help within the electorate of Macquarie. They have an indelible impact on our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Families, lone parents, the seniors in our society and our young people who are battling to identify how they can move forward, rely on the helping hand, strength and commitment of these organisations. The passion of these organisations is to bring support and hope and respond to the needs of those who are our most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of making it easy for civil society, the ACNC has made it harder, with increased and duplicated regulatory burdens discouraging involvement in voluntary and community endeavour. Many Australians would not know that the ACNC has been granted more power than the regulators of the corporate sector. Under its legislatio<span style="font-weight:bold;">n</span> the ACNC requires more information from civil society, from yet another agency of government, and it has increased reporting requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already delivered greater certainty to civil society through our current reform of grant and contracting arrangements that provide longer contracting periods. This provides more certainty to social-service providers, enabling them to make plans more easily on leases and operational and staffing matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In place of the ACNC, the government will establish a Centre for Excellence, the ownership of which will be transitioned to the sector itself. I, like many on this side of the House, am passionate about the sector taking ownership of self-regulation, and applying the expertise and experience it has to offer. The new Centre for Excellence will promote innovation and education and training within the sector and will advocate for the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is serious about providing real support to civil society, including our plan to cut red tape and our plan to simplify reporting requirements and provide greater certainty through streamlined contracting arrangements. The last thing that the coalition wants to do, especially in these fiscally difficult times, is to hamper the activities of our civil society in delivering on its aspirations. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I rise today to join my Labor colleagues in opposing the government's plan to axe the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. This is the first of two bills to repeal the ACNC. It proposes to repeal the ACNC Act 2012 with replacement arrangements set to be dealt with in a later bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission was introduced by the former Labor government in October 2012 and was set up to provide the public with a freely-available resource on charities. Its objectives are to maintain, protect and enhance public trust and confidence in the Australian not-for-profit sector; to support and sustain a robust, vibrant, independent and innovative Australian not-for-profit sector; and to promote the reduction of unnecessary regulatory obligations on the Australian not-for-profit sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite that last point, the Abbott government believes that abolishing the commission will reduce red tape for the charity sector. Every day, we hear the Abbott government claiming to be cutting red tape. Ironically, scrapping the commission means abolishing its red-tape-reduction directorate—the very people in charge of reducing regulatory burdens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACNC plays an important role in society. It was set up for a reason. It should remain in place for that reason. It is protecting Australians from charity scammers by requiring not-for-profits to report annually on their financial activities. It has also created a searchable register so that people can quickly check the bona fides of an organisation before donating money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the commission was a key reform of the previous Labor government and we will not sit idly by while the coalition tears it down. In my electorate of Canberra I regularly meet with not-for-profit organisations. Before this life, I had my own business. The beauty of having my own business is that it allowed me the freedom and flexibility to be on a number of boards, both paid and voluntary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was on two not-for-profit boards as a voluntary director. The first was the Gift of Life board, which was designed to improve awareness about organ and tissue donation. I am a very strong advocate of organ and tissue donation. Since being in this parliament I have set up the Parliamentary Friends of Organ and Tissue Donation and at every opportunity have spoken about the need for Australians to improve the pretty ordinary record of donating their organs and tissues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other board I was on was the Wellness Board, which was brand new. We were the first group of voluntary directors on it. It was established by the ACT government to raise funds for the Canberra Hospital. There are a number of philanthropists both in Canberra and around Australia who have had wonderful experiences at the Canberra Hospital and who, before they passed on or when they got well, decided they wanted to donate some money to the hospital. As a result of having this pool of money in this Wellness foundation we decided that maybe there is a broader community interest in donating to the Canberra Hospital for its range of services—from paediatrics to gynaecology and a broad range of other services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This not-for-profit group was established to go out to the broader community and raise funds for the Canberra Hospital. We did very well in our first year but I have to take my hat off to the current board, at the helm of Debbie Rolfe. She and her husband are very well-known figures here in Canberra. She has done an extraordinary job with that board of raising millions of dollars for the Canberra Hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have my own experience of being on charity not-for-profit organisations as a volunteer director so I enjoy any opportunity to go out to a not-for-profit organisation in Canberra. I have been actively involved with OzHarvest and the Yellow Van, which donate tens of thousands of meals every month to feed the less advantaged in our community. This is part of the Food Rescue program that has been rolled out right across Australia. It goes to supermarkets and restaurants and catering outfits—a broad range of organisations—to rescue food. This is saving a huge amount of infill and passes that food onto a broad range of groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been out on a number of trips to rescue the food and then drop it off. I have been to women's refuges where the value of a cupcake is extraordinary. It cheers up these women who have been through all sorts of domestic violence and brutal experiences. A little cupcake just makes their day. I have been to a number of high schools where the students get meals provided after they finish their day at school. Quite often, those kids go home to an empty pantry and no meal on the table, so it is vitally important that they go home to do their homework fuelled up with a bit of protein, some fruit and veg, and a healthy drink—something in their bellies. So, as I said, I have been to high schools, women's refuges and a broad range of groups across Canberra, including aged-care centres and centres for the homeless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The food rescue program here in Canberra is quite extraordinary. The model been changed. Now people go to the Communities@Work centre at Tuggeranong. People go to what is like a little supermarket there. There is a great deal of dignity. People just pay a token amount of money for the food, and the organisations pay a token amount of money for the food, so that there is dignity in engaging in that assistance program. It is a token amount of money, it gives people a sense of dignity and it helps them out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked closely with mental health NGOs, such as Lifeline, assisting those at risk of suicide and depression, while also contributing to local community events through their annual book fair. I have stacked many a shelf at their annual book fair. Their book fairs are huge here in Canberra. They are held about three or four times a year. Whenever they hold the one at Erindale, I am there stacking books, categorising books and usually buying too many books as well in the process. It is a fair that raises a significant amount of money for Lifeline and it is very strongly supported by Canberrans, and I thank them for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also met with Indigenous not-for-profit groups, aged-care providers and many church-run organisations who look after the vulnerable. I am talking here about Marymead as well as the Brindabella Women's Group. There are so many organisations doing great work here in Canberra. As I have said many times, people see Canberra as being unidimensional. We are the seat of government, the seat of bureaucracy, the nation's capital, and that is about it, but we are much more than that. We are a community with a variety of different income levels and we do have significant pockets of disadvantage. I see them whenever I am out in the electorate. I have just recounted some of the areas of disadvantage in talking about the organisations that support them. There are a number of organisations for children, women, families and older Canberrans in need. There are a number of organisations out there supporting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The social benefits of not-for-profits are recognised by government support in the form of direct outlays and tax concessions. As a consequence, not-for-profits and other donors are influencing where community and government resources are directed. That is why it is essential that the not-for-profit sector is transparent and promotes public confidence. As we know—and as your experience, Deputy Speaker Goodenough, would show, as well as my own experience—this sector is huge. It is crucial that there is an independent national regulator such as the ACNC. The sector employs over one million Australians, turns over around $100 billion, involves almost five million volunteers and is at the heart of all our communities. According to recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2012-13 the charity and not-for-profit sector contributed almost $58 billion—that is, four per cent of all GDP—to the Australian economy. They are big numbers, no matter which way you cut them. And it is growing at a rate of about six per cent per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By requiring not-for-profits to report annually on their financial activities, the ACNC is reducing the risk of charity scammers. To date, the commission has registered 59,697 charities on its online register. It has also pursued legal action against four dodgy charities for ripping off donors, and it has revoked the charity status of more than 700 organisations for failing to report on their annual activity. The commission received 202 complaints in its first year, including 48 for fraud or criminal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to read from a recent article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uardian</span> which I believe highlights the exact reasons why the ACNC should not be abolished. It is headed 'Global fundraising company keeps $7m of $12.2m raised for Special Olympics' and says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A global company that raises funds on behalf of some of Australia's largest charities will be investigated after it emerged that 96% of the $12.2m it raised for Special Olympics Australia was not retained by the charity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2011, the Sydney-based Appco Group has implemented a gift voucher program on behalf of Special Olympics Australia, a charity that runs sports for people with intellectual disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Guardian Australia investigation into Appco's conduct of the program, and its fundraising work for other charities, has found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Special Olympics Australia retained just 4% of the money raised from the gift vouchers</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The article goes into further detail about other charities where significant amounts did not go to the actual charity. Later in the article it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In March, 54 major charities, including Save the Children, Lifeline and the RSPCA, wrote an open letter appealing to the government to spare the regulator, saying it had done "impressive work" towards efficiency and transparency in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to draw from some of the submissions these charities have made, pleading with the government to keep the ACNC. Submissions were made by not just charities but also organisations. A number of charitable organisations came out slamming the government's plan to axe the ACNC. In fact, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into the ACNC repeal bill in June 2014. Of the 155 charities and other organisations that made a submission to that inquiry, over 80 per cent supported retaining the commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">World Vision CEO, Tim Costello, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The commission is actually working for us and it gives the public confidence, it underpins the consumer benefit to charities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chief executive of the Community Council for Australia, David Crosbie, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACNC is more efficient than the government regulators it replaced, is doing good work and deserves a chance to achieve its three goals of reducing red tape, increasing public trust and strengthening the charities sector … Axing the ACNC would be a very clear sign that government is not interested in the considered views of the charities sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that by abolishing the ACNC it is reducing red tape. Yet, according to evidence given at estimates in October this year, the ACNC saves Australian charities $120 million a year by reducing compliance costs and red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An independent study by Ernst &amp; Young confirmed that the ACNC significantly reduced the reporting burden for charities, leaving them more time to focus on actually helping Australian communities—the job that they do best. The report noted: 'A core component of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission's reporting framework and efforts around reducing red tape is the "report once, use often" principle. This principle is consistent with recommendations issued by the Productivity Commission, the National Commission of Audit, the Australian National Audit Office, the Treasury and the Department of Finance.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the fact that Australia needs a well-regulated charitable sector to prevent against charity scams, and in fact does not create extra regulatory burdens as I have just highlighted, this bill will lead to significant job losses. The government plans to return responsibility for regulating charities to the Australian Taxation Office, at the same time as it is sacking over 4,700 staff from this agency. I would like to know how the ATO is expected to take on responsibility for the ACNC when the ATO itself is losing staff in droves? How many staff will be redeployed to the ATO, if any?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only will people lose their jobs as a result of this bill, there has already been a high staff turnover as a result of the uncertainty the ACNC is facing. According to its annual report, the number of ongoing, full-time employees fell from 94 at 30 June 2013 to 63 by 30 June 2014. The Abbott government claims it is about creating jobs. Well, this is in clear contrast to that goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, the ACNC helps charities strengthen their transparency and accountability so the public can have confidence in the sector and the good work they do. This legislation is bad for the not-for-profit sector, it is bad for jobs, it is bad for Australia—and nobody is buying it.</span>

                    <a href="230531" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BUCHHOLZ:</span>
                    </a>  As you should keep good and fine order in this House, Mr Deputy Speaker. The bill we are debating is the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill 2014. Predominantly the bill seeks to repeal an act that was introduced by the previous Rudd-Gillard government. During the course of my contribution I will highlight reasons and, at every point, my name will appear in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> opposing the introduction of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I am so passionate about the repealing of this act is that, before coming to politics, I had quite a successful transport operation. The genesis of my transport business was that I started with one vehicle. My wife and I had one vehicle that ran between Rockhampton and Emerald, and I grew the business to a couple more trucks operating around Queensland. I was encouraged to apply for a sort of chamber of commerce regional award for business excellence, or whatever the award was. I nominated and I won the chamber of commerce award. I felt most humbled by the fact that I had been recognised by my peers in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A dark hand appeared on my shoulder from nowhere and a voice said, 'You have made many millions of dollars from this community. What have you given back?' The hand was no other than that of the chairman of the local Lifeline Central Queensland branch. He said, 'It is now your time to give back to the community. As the chair, I am offering you a board position to get involved with Lifeline Queensland.' I said that I would be more than happy to make a contribution, but I am Catholic; I am not of the faith of Lifeline. He said, 'I'm not reaching out to you because I want your religious persuasion. I'm reaching out to you because I want your business excellence. I want you to come and influence our business.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most charities rely on the philanthropy of the community. They rely on good business management to run their businesses efficiently, and at the other end of the spectrum they rely on the outstanding contributions from trained counsellors and from those who are far more generous of their time than I ever believed I could ever be for the Lifeline family. There are a number of business elements to the Lifeline business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make a long story short as I do not want to bore the House because I am aware that, at this time of the year, we are all in a festive mood. There are Christmas parties on, hosted by both sides of the House, celebrating the great work that is done by staff in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chairman said to me, 'You need to make a contribution to pay back the community which you have made money from,' and which I continue to do. Proudly, I can say that, during my three years as a Lifeline executive for Central Queensland, I increased their business turnover by 318 per cent. Every cent of that money ended up back in that community. I am open about it; I am not your counsellor. I may have been gifted with a good business mind, but I am not the bloke you need to come to with a sad story because you will find little sympathy. There are others more confident in that area. I expanded my business interests from Central Queensland further south into the state. I opened and established another seven transport depots, employed probably another 50 men and bought a fleet of trucks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The state board of Lifeline reached out and said, 'We could use your skills.' I accepted a position as a state board director of Lifeline and I systematically set about restructuring the entire governance procedures for the state of Queensland. Today, I am led to believe that those governance procedures still lead them to profitable outcomes each year—a mighty outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of that passion and because I gave those many hours freely, that I stand here and try to bring some type of efficiency back to the not-for-profit sector, because at every step of this debate I have opposed this. Listen to me closely. This bill was brought to this House under the principle that it was to reduce red tape. Guess how the Rudd-Gillard government was going to reduce red tape and reduce bureaucracy?</span>

                    </a> The member for Bowman is dead right. They were going to create another level of bureaucracy. Now, you may think, 'How can this be? How could someone think, for one moment, that the best way to reduce red tape and bureaucracy is to create another layer?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me talk you through the process of how this transpired. This was at a time when stimulus programs were being created by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. I am talking about programs such as the insulation program, where billions of dollars were spent to put insulation batts into ceilings of houses around Australia. They got halfway through that program. Unfortunately, Australian lives were lost. God bless those lives. Houses owned by families were burnt to the ground—decimated. Lives were destroyed. For the remainder of the program, the money was spent pulling the insulation out of those homes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The logic was chaotic at the time the bill creating the ACNC was brought to the House; the nature of the process was somewhat dysfunctional.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> I am speaking directly to the bill and how dysfunctional the genesis of this was. Members on the other side of the House say, 'Speak to the bill.' I gladly go back to how poor the reasoning for the original bill was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extra layers of bureaucracy were brought about to create the ACNC. I remind the members on the opposite side of the House that the ACNC's core role was to go back to the states of Australia and to say to them, 'You need, as a state, to reduce the level of bureaucracy that you have. You need to reduce the levels of bureaucracy that you have in the states so that we can provide a dividend. That is our mantra. That is our charter.' That was the primary reason this organisation was established. You should never forget the reasons this was brought to the House. It was poorly thought out. It was poorly executed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will proudly stand here defending every volunteer in Australia who gives their time freely, whether it be at a surf lifesaving club, a rural fire brigade, Lifeline, or any other charity in Australia. This is a blight on their collective activities in trying to make Australia a better place. I believe that activities in the Year of the Volunteer, last year or the year before, showed that collectively the value of our volunteers around Australia—for the energies that they provide at local, state and federal government levels—is somewhere in the vicinity of $15 billion a year, calculated on the basis of what it would cost if we were to pay those beautiful volunteers who give their time on so many fronts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we took office we said that we would oppose this. The government's position on this should come as no shock to anyone. I spoke in this House and opposed the original legislation when the then government, Labor, decided that the best way to get rid of bureaucracy was to create another level of bureaucracy. From a commercial perspective that was bizarre. It was bizarre then and it is equally perplexing to this day.</span>

                    </a>  I can understand the frustration that would come from the other side of the House, because this is not your finest hour. As an opposition this is not your finest hour—bringing to the House your perplexing logic. So many times, from an economic perspective, the coalition is brought to office for one particular reason, and that is to fix the economic mess—to fix the mess that has been left by logic which is sometimes questionable. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave you with those comments. As they put their heads on their pillows tonight, every volunteer who gives time for a charity group in Australia can rest easy knowing that a coalition government—who gave a commitment before the election—will very much look after their interests and make sure that there is an efficient work place. I would now like to commend this bill to the House, and I encourage those that have a little bit of time for our volunteers to commend this bill to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  On this, the 160th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade, it is a pleasure to speak in this adjournment debate. 'It is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called upon to obey, [and] taxation without representation is tyranny.' So began the call of ten thousand Australians for self-determination, one weekend in November 1854. It was the first solid step towards Australian democracy, and the beginnings of a cherished national identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The goldfields of 19th century Ballarat were a colourful and varied place. The call of gold had brought the hopeful from across the globe, drawing together such a number of cultures and nations as to make what happened there all the more remarkable. The 10,000 bound themselves under the oath of the Southern Cross to each other, determined that any rights available to one would be reflected upon the others. The charter says: 'It is not the wish of the League to effect an immediate separation of this colony from the parent country, if equal laws and equal rights are dealt out to the whole community …' Less than one month later, on 3 December, this stockade, made of miners, immigrants, men and women, stood together under the flag of the Southern Cross where they were attacked. It took only twenty minutes for troopers to reach the flag and tear it down, leaving 22 diggers dead, along with five troopers. The charter reads: 'We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not the end for the Ballarat Reform League. Their struggle for basic human rights and their fight to be free of unjust, uncaring tyranny sparked changes that led to freedoms for all Australians—freedoms we now hold dear, and ideas like the right to a fair go, of personal liberty and a national identity forged around mateship. The charter reads: ' … the Reform League will endeavour to supersede such Royal prerogative by asserting that … the people are the only legitimate source of all political power.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This significant moment in Australian history is all the more powerful for its selfless reach and universal application. The crowd at Eureka was fuelled by anger, disappointment and fear, and yet their struggle birthed a charter determined to reshape a more equal society for all. The fundamental tenets of the charter called for full and fair representation; suffrage for all men—women would, of course, come later; the eligibility of nonlandowners to hold office; the payment of members of parliament; and a short parliamentary duration. Not only that, the charter itself presents the first serious call for the freedom of the press in Australia's history, making it the first time a real platform for an Australian democracy was laid out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today has seen my home town of Ballarat come together to celebrate the anniversary of Eureka, and I am so proud to be able to speak on behalf of the people of Ballarat. Sovereign Hill held its light and sound show, 'Blood on the Southern Cross', in commemoration this morning. A memorial service at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka saw the raising of a flag hand-stitched by Eureka Stockade descendants, as well as fine speeches by the Hon. Steve Bracks; Mayor of the City of Ballarat John Phillips; and MADE Chairman Kaaren Koomen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, as a nation, we may be letting the Eureka spirit fade. The anniversary of the stockade is not a date well known by children around the country. It is not even an annual fixture in the schools of Victoria, the site of the gold rush that energised this country for more than 50 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also not a simple event. Australians died on both sides—fighting for greater rights and fighting for the state. The actions of the colourful protagonists, such as Governor Hotham and rebel leader Peter Lalor are still debated from many angles. Peter Lalor's later election as the member for Ballarat and North Grenville just served to demonstrate the complex nature of the events. We have seen the adoption of the Eureka flag by many causes, both left and right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this does not serve to reduce the relevance of what happened, 160 years ago. It should spark a deeper debate, a greater connection to our education, more literate institutions and a greater understanding of our nation and ourselves. The Eureka fight for equality, representation and freedom continues today around the world, and we should be very proud of what Australia has done to contribute to that legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay particular tribute to the people who keep the Eureka spirit alive—the fantastic Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka; the Children of Eureka, whose idea it was initially to have a copy of the diggers' charter tabled in this place—and I will seek leave to do that shortly; and the families of the descendants of those who were at the stockade. It is groups like these that make sure the legacy of the Eureka stockade lives on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legacy is simply stated in the charter's concluding words, that cut right to the heart of why the 160th anniversary is so important: 'Its principles and objects are the full political rights of all people.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I seek leave to table a copy of the diggers' charter, a larger version of which I will have in my office and which will continue, hopefully, in perpetuity in this place, in all the of members for Ballarat's offices into the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TONY SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise this evening to recognise someone who gave so much to this House—not a former member, but a former servant of this House and all that it stands for nonetheless. Pauline Osmond recently passed away. She worked for five federal Liberal members from Victoria. She joined our party in 1975. She masterminded Bob Halverson's 1984 election campaign, and worked for him as the member for Casey, first down in the old House and then here, for the entirety of his career as a backbencher, as a whip, as Speaker, and then again as a backbencher. Pauline then worked for Speakers Andrew and Hawker before retiring for health reasons. But for the last couple of years, she returned to work part-time in my office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met her here in Canberra as a young staff member. She was the friendly staff member in the whip's office. She was Victorian, helpful, fun, cheeky and, above all, smart. I would not be the member for Casey had I not met her. She encouraged me, cajoled me and helped me win preselection and then managed my first election campaign in 2001—but that was all in her spare time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She loved this House and all that it stands for. She loved policy debate, here and in the media, particularly watching the Paul Murray show at night. She knew history; she wrote extremely well; she was loyal, dedicated, and hardworking. She had a magnificent sense of humour, a rich and ever-inquiring mind, a determined and pugnacious sense of right and wrong and a stubborn but beautiful inability to hold her tongue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While politics was a big part of her life, there was endless energy for her other loves: her community and her family. She was born in Croydon and lived there her whole life. She loved the Croydon community and gave back, particularly at this time of the year, donating Christmas food parcels to those in need with the assistance of the Victorian Relief Committee—of which her late mother, Dame Phyllis Frost, had been chairman. Each year local service clubs would donate money and Pauline would go bartering with the local supermarket at Chirnside Park to get the best deal, so they could feed as many people as they could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1966 she married Ken and they had one daughter, Caroline. Pauline was a passionate daughter, wife, sister, mother and grandmother. She loved her home and she was a first-class cook and an obsessive preserver of everything possible. She was a loyal friend to many but an honest character assessor of those who crossed her or let her down. Equally, she was the most sympathetic and caring person I have met. In her private life and in the office she had a nuclear sense of what was right and wrong and brought that to everything she did. For the last year, we worked together on a particularly complex immigration case, and we succeeded just days before her passing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She worked hard, quietly and privately with a serious illness for many years. In the 1980s she had an operation. Prior to it she had asked if she could bank some of her own blood in case she needed a transfusion. She was told it was not necessary and that they had their own supplies, and during the operation she did require a transfusion. Years later, she received a letter advising her to have a blood test because it had been discovered some of the blood donations were contaminated. She was diagnosed with hepatitis C, which had advanced significantly and damaged her liver, and this eventually progressed to liver cancer. She battled on, determined to live life to the full. That included coming back to work for me a couple of days a week, which she did until literally days before her death, which occurred quite suddenly on 13 October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us miss her and will never forget her, but nor should this place where she spent so much of her life and where she gave so much because she cared about our democracy, this parliament and our country. To Ken, to her sisters Elizabeth and Christine, to Caroline, and to her grandchildren Sophie and James—whose photos covered her office—you should all be proud of her life well lived. To her friends far and wide in the Liberal Party and the broader community, including my staff—particularly Denise Jeffs who worked with her in the Halverson office and then in mine—be sad and melancholy for sure but feel blessed that such a person touched your life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83S" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Today is International Day of People with Disability, and I would like to reflect on not only the significant contributions people with disability make in our community but also the still as yet untapped potential they offer to workplaces and the wider community. Over four million Australians have a disability. That is one in four people in our community. Their disabilities range across a spectrum of physical disability, hearing and vision loss, intellectual or developmental disorders and mental health disorders, which present serious challenges in their everyday lives but do not define them as human beings. While 3.4 million of these people have physical disabilities of one kind or another, almost 90 per cent have a disability which is invisible to the naked eye. We have come a long way as a society in our recognition of the capacity and dignity of people with disability, particularly in the last few years, but we have come nowhere near far enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to have been a member of the Labor government which established the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which will provide every Australian with the personal care and support they need in the event they are either born with or acquire a disability. Whilst I do not know this personally, I have a nephew with downs, and I watch each day my brother and his wife struggle with the difficulties that brings. Chris is an amazing child. He is full of life, he is full of beans, he is as cheeky as all get out, but at 13 he has very little language. He will progress and he will make strides, but Chris will have downs today, downs tomorrow and we all live with the reality of what that will bring, particularly his two sisters who understand that this journey will not end for them anytime soon. But I do not want to talk about him, because I think that is his story to tell some day and I am sure he will be able to do it brilliantly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge particularly the bipartisan dedication to the National Disability Insurance Scheme that was borne in this parliament. I urge the government to do everything possible to keep to their election commitment and ensure that the scheme is rolled out in full in the time frame promised. There are just too many people suffering with inadequate services or watching loved ones languish in nursing homes to allow any delay in this vital scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> Gone are the days when people with a disability were just written off as being of no use. We have grown as a society. We know far more today than we did yesterday, and we have a far greater depth of understanding of the causes of many disabilities and the acute impact they have on a person's capacity to work and participate in the things we all take for granted. More often than not, the only barrier facing most people in attaining employment or participating fully in everyday life activities is access—access we can grant them merely through minor changes or modifications to our infrastructures, services and most importantly our attitudes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once upon a time, the parents of a child with autism were told by doctors, paediatricians and others that because they could not find any biological cause of their child's behaviour it must be due to a defect in their parenting. These children were left to struggle in schools with curriculums unable to cater to their needs. While we do not have a conclusive understanding of the root cause of autism, we do understand its range of effects and development therapies and learning tools which are helping young people with autism learn and develop at a rate which enables many of them to become indistinguishable from their peers. A child diagnosed with autism today has a far greater chance of achieving their full potential in life than a person born decades ago—not because autism has changed but because our understanding of it and our adjustment to the learning environment for people with it has changed dramatically. And it is no different for people with any disability seeking employment or opportunities in the avenue of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, people with a disability have an employment rate of just 38.9 per cent, compared to 79.4 per cent for people without a disability. We rank 21 out of 29 OECD countries for employment rates of people with a disability and 27 for people with a disability living in or near poverty. These figures are not a reflection on the capacity of people with a disability to work; they are a reflection on our willingness to offer them the opportunity and to accommodate them in our workplaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to use this opportunity to encourage more employers to actively consider the role of people with a disability in their own workplace. Just three per cent of employers turn to Disability Employment Services when recruiting and, without the active participation of more employers, we will not be able to turn these figures around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own office I have had the opportunity to have individuals with disability work for me. Lachlan, who is legally blind and has autism, worked for me for many years. The only issue was what radio station we played every day! Alexis, who has osteogenisis imperfecta—often known as 'brittle bone disease'—is bound to a specialised wheelchair and has more degrees than I care to mention. She cannot get full-time work but works for me on a voluntary, contributory basis and offers much to my office. Mario, who has cerebral palsy and physical limitations, is a great asset to my office because of his computer skills. More people need to employ people like Alex and Mario. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise to speak on a number of very positive developments taking place in the Royal Australian Navy as part of its Women's Leadership Strategy. The Navy's Women's Leadership Strategy 2012-15 was an initiative of the then Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Ray Griggs, and it sets a female participation rate for Navy of 25 per cent by 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy's momentum has been carried forward by the current Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Tim Barrett, who, recently, very proudly highlighted Navy's achievements in this space to me when, in October, I had a detailed briefing with him in my capacity as Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on a whole range of capability issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, so determined is Vice Admiral Barrett to ensure that Navy stays on course to achieve its 25 per cent participation target that he has updated Navy's strategy to include an interim time frame of 2018, which will also include an interim target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy aims to improve workforce capability by optimising the contribution of women through employment opportunities, professional development and leadership, as well as addressing a number of challenges that women face in progressing their careers. These obstacles include exclusion from informal male-orientated networks, work-life challenges, a lack of flexibility,    gender stereotyping, a lack of female role models, a lack of mentoring opportunities, a lack of work and training opportunities and clear career paths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very encouraging that the strategy specifically recognises that these challenges can be overcome through recognising what women already achieve; empowering women to identify leadership opportunities; supporting women to overcome barriers to participation; and enhancing the leadership skills and professional development opportunities for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to report that Navy is making great headway in achieving these goals. In the financial year 2013-14, it achieved a female recruiting rate of 22.9 per cent overall, up from 1.2 per cent on the previous year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of gender-based occupational segregation impacts on the nation, not just on Navy, and it impacts enormously in terms of lost productivity. In this regard, I note what I consider to be yet another very positive development that, by January 2016, all combat roles within the Australian Defence Force will be open to women. Ahead of this time frame, I am very pleased to inform the House that Navy has just recently recruited its first female clearance diver, which to those of us with a non-military background is the equivalent of being a member of the Special Forces.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In line with the first pillar of the strategy, I would like to highlight the roles performed by some of Navy's amazing women: Captain Allison Norris, who just recently completed her command of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Success</span> and who was also responsible for Navy's response to the MH17 incident; Commander Cath Hayes, who, as Commanding Officer of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Toowoomba </span>was responsible for the seizure of more than $280 million of cannabis resin as part of a joint operation with the Royal New Zealand Air Force; and Rear Admiral Robyn Walker, who was the first female in Navy to reach star rank in 2005 and is now the highest ranked woman in the RAN.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These three women in no way represent the exhaustive list of the amazing women who are currently serving in Navy—in fact, far from it. There are so many women and I do not have enough time in tonight's adjournment speech to name them. Many of these women might be embarrassed by having their achievements highlighted and brought to public attention, but pioneers of achievement need to be celebrated and should serve as an inspiration for many others.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="WF6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  On 18 November some Torah-observant Jews in the Har Nof Synagogue in West Jerusalem were praying shacharit, the daily morning prayer. The silence of their prayer was shattered by two jihadists, who knew the rhythm of the congregation and butchered four unarmed rabbis and a brave Druze policeman who sought to intervene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the men in the Har Nof Synagogue, Yaakov Amos, was in the middle of a prayer called Sim Shalom, which means 'grant peace.' As part of every prayer service, a thrice-daily ritual asks God to 'grant peace everywhere, goodness and blessing, grace, loving kindness and mercy to us all'. His call for worldwide compassion and peace was answered by evil murder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These two Palestinian jihadists entered this house of prayer, brandishing guns and a meat cleaver. They slaughtered five and injured seven other worshippers. The PFLP, the second largest part of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Liberation Organisation, took credit for this attack, but it was probably organised by the new Hamas faction that is based in Turkey, about which we had a debate in this parliament just this week at one of the friendship group meetings. A dear Australian-born friend of mine, Arnold Roth, pointed out that the slaughter of these unarmed rabbis at prayer had nothing to do with the grievances about the Temple Mount. Most of the ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Har Nof synagogue—indeed, most ultra-Orthodox Jews—do not subscribe to the view that one should visit the holy Temple Mount or, as the Arabs call it, the Haram al-Sharif because one might trample on the holy of holies, the old temple that stood there a millennium ago. It has nothing to do with occupation; Har Nof is in the far west of Jerusalem, far away from the 1967 borders. It has nothing to do with settlements; no Arab or Muslim had ever made their home where Har Nof stood. It had nothing to do with oppressing Arabs; at least one of the two murderers is reported to have lived in the neighbourhood grocery just down from the synagogue supporting himself and others from that source. It certainly has no dimension of getting back at the Israeli military; the victims were men engaged in full-time learning in the Torah who do not participate in military service. The site of the killings, a Haredi synagogue, is not emblematic of what Israel stands for in the Arab mind; it is emblematic of what Jews represent, especially in the torrent of incitement that must be one of the issues that we deal with eventually when a two-state solution comes about. Those sermons, cartoons and video clips have been endlessly shown to members of this parliament; they are intolerable and must be addressed if any peace treaty is to be arrived at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All acts of terrorism are barbaric—whether it is the murder of unarmed Kenyan mineworkers or the slaughter of non-Muslim Yazidis or Muslim Shias—but there is something unspeakably evil about murdering four holy men immersed in prayer. Every member of this House holds that all Australians have the right to freedom of worship without fear. To be involved in an act like this is a violation that is both aesthetically and ethically repugnant to all Australians. When a Jewish extremist killed Muslim worshippers, I am very proud to say, the Prime Minister of Israel excommunicated him from the people of Israel—as did the Chief Rabbinate—for his heinous actions. No mainstream section of Israeli society attempted to explain, let alone justify, his acts. Yes, Mr Abbas made a perfunctory condemnation under pressure from Secretary Kerry; but, if one looks at the Facebook page of the Palestinian Authority, the statements of its religious affairs adviser are all in sympathy for the terrorists. Indeed, Madam Speaker, I regretfully have to report to you that the Speaker of the Jordanian parliament held prayers for the two murderers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very interesting that Secretary Kerry, on behalf of the American government, condemned these attacks—just like the Australian government. Indeed the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nothing can justify the senseless violence against innocent people going about their worship. Our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who were killed in this horrific attack …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When one is trying to organise a two-state solution and peace between parties incitement and this kind of horrific killing, and support for it afterwards by mainstream Palestinian sources, has to be addressed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">):</span>  As the year draws to a close here in Parliament House, there are many things our minds turn to as Christmas rapidly approaches. Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to wish you and your entire family a joyful and safe Christmas. I send that same wish to all my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the chamber and their families. This is an adversarial place and, particularly around this time of the year, we should be a little more charitable to each other. I thank all the staff in Parliament House; please enjoy your Christmas break and know that we appreciate all the work you do for us. I thank my staff—Jonathan, Candice, Shannen, Gail and Karen—for all your work and the support you give me in my electorate of Swan. I could not do my work without you. To everyone in the electorate of Swan, I wish you a merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to my family and, in particular, my wife, Cheryle, who supports me in every way. Cheryle is the hardest-working volunteer I have ever had. She completes my life and I cannot speak highly enough of her commitment to me and my work as a parliamentarian. Cheryle and I are passionate about many social issues, but if there is one thing we both want to see happen it is to achieve the aim of zero abuse of children. This is a discussion this country needs to have. Throughout Australia's history child abuse has often been dismissed, particularly by those who had the power to hold to account those who would seek to commit such acts, as we saw for many years with the forgotten Australians and the child migrants. In my first speech in this place, I said we should apologise to all the children who were never removed from an abusive environment, whether it was with carers or within their own family environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cheryle and I discussed last week the fact that as we approach Christmas, which is supposed to be a time of joy, there are still many children in metropolitan, rural, remote and regional areas throughout Australia who are living in fear of abuse. They are not looking forward to Christmas because they know the abuse will continue, and increase, when they have to spend time in that abusive environment instead of going to school. Over the past decade discussion about child abuse has, however, become more prevalent—and for that I thank governments along with the victims' advocates. I know this issue is close to the hearts of everyone in this place who believes in the protection of innocents and the protection of our most vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people who think an abused child is better off with its parents even though they may be the abuser or abusers. Well, I do not agree with that. People who think that way might never have been a victim of abuse, and they need to understand the fear of an abused child. From conversations I have had with victims of abuse, the last place they want to be is with their abusers. Today I call for everyone in this place and our nation to focus on saving our children from abusers. I do not care what culture the abusers come from or where they live; there is no excuse. Our role is paramount in changing the processes that abused children are put through. We need to remove children from an abusive environment the second we know about it; and they should not be returned to be abused over and over and over again because of some 'progressive' mindset that infects the processes of saving abused children. Anyone who abuses a child should have no rights at all; and, as I said before, this country needs to have that conversation. In closing, I ask our nation to look out for our children and protect them from any sort of abuse. Be brave and interfere if you suspect abuse; and bring it to the attention of the authorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time I have left, I would like to mention a personal aspect of this. Both Cheryle and I have family members who have suffered from abuse, and we are very strongly in favour of making sure that children who are abused are never returned to those who abuse them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  I rise to speak about the Victorian state election last Saturday and in particular how it relates to the state electorates contained within the federal electorate of Scullin. Four years ago, the Baillieu government was elected, promising to fix the problems. Clearly, this was a promise which resonated with the Victorian community, concerned about significant quality-of-life issues, particularly in the growth areas which represent much of the electorate of Scullin. But, after that, we saw a state government characterised by inertia and a state government which said one thing before an election and did very different things after it—a familiar concept to those of us in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw the impact of very significant cuts at a state level leading to a range of very serious social consequences, including very high youth unemployment. These have been compounded in the communities I represent by the policies of this federal government—in particular, the refusal to fund urban public transport and a cruel budget opposed by Victorians, particularly those within Scullin, who looked for and found in the Labor Party led by Daniel Andrews a government which will put people first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to acknowledge the contribution the five Labor candidates and members made in ensuring that Scullin will be adequately represented in this state Labor government. Firstly, Vicki Ward, the new member for Eltham, ran an extraordinary campaign, ably assisted by a fantastic young woman in the form of Clare Keys Lilley. Danielle Green, the member for Yan Yean, was returned despite an enormous investment made by the Liberal Party, including visits from former Prime Minister John Howard—I note the current Prime Minister did not participate in this campaign significantly. My friend Colin Brooks, the member for Bundoora, was comfortably returned. It was very pleasing to see a large swing to Bronwyn Halfpenny, the member for Thomastown, which has significant growth areas and desperately requires infrastructure support it has not been getting. My great friend and former boss Lily D'Ambrosio, the member for Mill Park, was also returned with a very significant swing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to working with all my Labor colleagues. I am so pleased to see Scullin completely represented by Labor members. I am looking forward to seeing the Mernda rail, the O'Herns Road interchange and improvements to buses, schools and our local health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also take this opportunity to give my thanks to the members of the Scullin Labor Party. It is an absolute privilege to work with and for you all. I think, together with our five state Labor members, we can do great things for Melbourne's north under an Andrews Labor government. We look forward to seeing more positive developments in the federal arena: a government that cares about outer suburban communities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  As everyone would be aware, we have moved very much into the Christmas season. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we also at this time of year send out Christmas cards. It is a nice gesture that we make at this time of the year, spreading goodwill and cheer amongst the community. I am sending a Christmas card to the electorate this year. The theme of this Christmas card recognises and honours our first response volunteers and, at the risk of using a prop, here it is. The photos on the front of the Christmas card represent different first response volunteers in our community: Scott Blair and Madison, both from Yamba and the SES in Yamba; Tonya Hawker from the Ballina marine rescue; Rachel Redman, who lives at Woodburn and who is part of the Evans Head surf-lifesaving club; and also Michael and Jaclyn Munro from Casino, a brother and sister, who are members of the Rural Fire Service. I think it is important to acknowledge these people, especially as we are coming into the time of the year in our country where a lot of these volunteers are called upon, and they do it out of their own time and with great goodwill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The SES is made up almost entirely of volunteers. There are 229 units located across New South Wales with 10,000 volunteers who are easily identified by their distinctive orange overalls. The major responsibilities for the SES are floods and storm operations but they also help out in road accident rescues, vertical rescues and bush searches and rescues. In relation to marine rescues, we have a couple of very dangerous bars in the electorate of Page such as the one in Ballina, which is very treacherous, and the Ballina Marine Rescue—who are acknowledged here and were formerly known as the Coast Guard Ballina—have saved countless lives, particularly of boaties who have overturned on that bar. The volunteer surf lifesavers are very well known throughout this country. They started in 1907 and have saved more than 615,000 lives and have spent more than 1.4 million hours patrolling our beaches. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the RFS—the Rural Fire Service—which is the world's largest volunteer fire service and provides emergency services to about 95 per cent of New South Wales. In the northern region there are over 13,000 volunteers and across the state, 73,000, and they have responded to over 23,000 incidents just in the past year—ranging from bush and grassfires to motor vehicle accidents and controlled burns. The annual fire brigade church service is on this Sunday morning at 8.30 at the Uniting Church, and I will be there. This Friday is International Volunteer Day, and I am very proud to say that my Christmas card this year is acknowledging our first-response volunteers. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  I rise to congratulate Daniel Andrews and his team on winning the election on Saturday. It is an important election for Victoria and I think they have made a very good call on this election. I also congratulate the state members within my electorate—Don Nardella, the member for Melton; Natalie Hutchins, the member for Sydenham; and Marlene Kairouz, the Labor member for Kororoit—all three were successful in being returned with a very high vote, which is consistent with the strong support that Labor has in the region and the area that I represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that upon the election that some of the commitments made are realised. Labor will remove 50 dangerous and congested level crossings and fix the local roads that we use every day. I am pleased to indicate that the Sydenham level crossing has been announced as one of these, as has the St Alban's level crossing. The St Alban's level crossing is one that has been very difficult in terms of congestion for that community. It is no longer in my electorate, but I certainly campaigned along with others to see a separation there. Tragically, there have been fatalities at that level crossing, and it has always been considered very high up by bodies, such as the RACV and others, as needing to be separated, indicating the importance of reducing danger and increasing traffic flow and reducing congestion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Women's and Children's Hospital is going to be built in Sunshine—with $200 million in state government funding—taking the pressure off the current services at Sunshine Hospital. It will create 2,000 jobs in construction and 500 jobs in the hospital, and it will bring much needed jobs to Melbourne's west. It is a great initiative that we would like to see realised as soon as possible. The Sunshine Hospital performs the third highest number of births of any Victorian hospital, and elective surgeries are often cancelled due to obstetric emergencies taking up theatre time. Labor plans to free up theatre space and beds at Sunshine Hospital so it can perform up to 7,000 more operations each year—that is going to be great. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new state government will also restore TAFE funding. TAFE funding took a big hit under the previous government, removing the opportunities for young people to acquire skills necessary for them to find decent employment. This is a great initiative by the state Labor government and will be great thing for young people in Melbourne's west and indeed throughout Victoria. Congratulation once again to Daniel Andrews and his team—a great victory on Saturday.</span>

                  </a>  It is shocking and outrageous that Senator Lee Rhiannon of the Greens made a statement in this parliament on 26 November 2014 which demonstrates that one of the senators of this parliament commemorated the brutal terrorist leader Prabhakaran, who not only killed innocent civilians but killed democratically elected politicians in Sri Lanka.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the members of this parliament are aware, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam commemorate the birthday of the leader of the LTTE, Prabhakaran, to coincide with Martyrs Day on 27 November each year. This is being celebrated by the LTTE supporters, who are continuing to promote separatism and radicalism in Sri Lanka after the defeat of the LTTE militarily more than nine years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sri Lanka fought a brutal, horrific, savage and barbaric LTTE outfit for over three decades, at huge human and material cost. The LTTE terrorists utilised innocent children for their cause as child soldiers and introduced cyanide capsules and suicide bombing to the world, using men, women and children to destroy economic, commercial, religious and public facilities. During the period of 30 years of conflict, the LTTE killed a number of democratically elected Sri Lankan leaders—including one President, seven cabinet ministers, 37 members of parliament, one presidential candidate, 10 political party leaders and the former foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar—and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. They used 300,000 innocent civilians as human shields for military advantage, preventing them from escaping to safe areas. It is also known that they used heavy weapons to brutalise and to terrorise during the move to divide Sri Lanka, challenging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. They also killed over 12,000 innocent civilians, killed 1,200 and wounded 2,500 Indian peacekeeping forces, and killed 27,000 and wounded 87,000 Sri Lankan military police. In 1990, 600 surrendered policeman were brutally murdered in the east of Sri Lanka by the LTTE.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we witness how the world is shocked by the atrocities of ISIS, while we condemn its brutal terrorist leaders, some Australian parliamentarians are commemorating terrorist leaders, which is shocking and a clear display of double standards. Under the circumstances I urge Senator Lee Rhiannon to make a public apology regarding her disgraceful and dishonest statement on Sri Lanka in this parliament. That is just untenable when, in the post-conflict era, Sri Lanka is positively progressing and people are enjoying a dividend of peace. The statement made by Senator Lee Rhiannon is unacceptable as she is supporting the LTTE while castigating the democratically elected President of Sri Lanka, which clearly creates disharmony and division amongst Sri Lankans in a peaceful Sri Lanka.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  Farm debt 10 years ago was $31 billion. Farm debt now, 10 years later, is $64,000 million. The number of farmers has declined by 30,000, from 213,000 down to 186,000. Farm debt has reached the stage where not only is it crippling the nation but also it will affect Australian economic performance. For the answers to this, of course, we must ask: what are the problems? The problems are very simple. The rest of the world is on 0.26 per cent interest rates and we are on 2.8 per cent—a 1,000 per cent difference. We have a policy of a dramatically overvalued currency, so every farmer has been cheated out of half his income. That is not a figure plucked out of the air. When Mr Keating allowed the dollar to freefall it went down to 49c—very good and congratulations, Mr Keating. But then he blew it up through the roof. Mr Costello also did the right thing: he allowed a free-floating dollar. When he allowed it to free float it went to 49c.</span>

Clearly, when the dollar is allowed to free float it goes down to around 50c, and that is where it should be. If you have to prop up your currency by having interest rates a thousand per cent higher than the rest of the world then there is something terribly wrong with your economic management or something terribly wrong with your economy and where it is going. We have got a $60,000 million a year current account deficit, and all we ever hear about in this place is a balanced budget—a balanced budget for the government. I would like a little bit of discussion about balancing the budget for the country, and to let Mr Keating have the last word. When it was $15,000 million he said we were going to be a banana republic. When it was $26,000 million, Mr Howard said it was the 'overwhelming problem above all else', because the country was going broke. Now it is not $15,000 million or $22,000 million; it is $60,000 million. The solutions to this problem are very simple. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  Members may remember when I spoke in the House earlier this year about coeliac disease to raise awareness of the community prevalence, the symptoms and the management of the disease. Coeliac disease is an immune-based illness caused by gluten and it is estimated to affect one in 70 Australians, but, unfortunately, 80 per cent are undiagnosed. This is a significant medical condition, which, if undiagnosed or mistreated, can cause serious health problems. For those with coeliac disease there is no cure. Management of the disease comes with a lifelong gluten free diet. This takes a lot of research, questioning and label reading to maintain, but when done correctly a lifelong gluten free diet can prevent or reverse many of the symptoms of this illness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia currently has the tightest regulations and the lowest levels of gluten in gluten free food, enabling those with coeliac disease to make informed decisions about the foods that can have a profound impact on their health. Of concern is the current proposal to raise the limit of allowable gluten in gluten free food from no detectable gluten to 20 parts per million gluten. I appreciate that countries such as the USA and Canada accept 20 parts per million. I note the argument being put by those supporting a loosening of the current Food Standards Australia New Zealand definition that as testing technology becomes more advanced and sophisticated and much lower levels of gluten can be detected it will become increasingly difficult for manufacturers to meet the current definition of an undetectable level of gluten. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that those with coeliac disease want a wide choice of food to eat but they do rely on correct food labelling to choose foods that are appropriately and correctly marked as gluten free and therefore safe for them to consume. In my view and I know in the view of others, the continuing health of those diagnosed with coeliac disease should be the priority in determining labelling of gluten free foods. So a safe level of gluten is certainly more important than manufacturing ease and cross-contamination issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, in a letter published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span>, Dr Geoffrey Forbes noted that there are few high quality studies determining a safe gluten intake for patients with coeliac disease, although it is known that tolerable amounts vary between patients. He refers to a 2011 United States Food and Drug Administration safety report which concluded that gluten levels in food of less than one part per million are required to protect the greatest number of patients with coeliac disease. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with Dr Forbes's comments in that letter that the concept of doing no harm in health care is paramount. Increasing the permissible level of gluten from undetectable to less than 20 parts per million will increase the overall amount of gluten that is ingested in a gluten free diet and that for an as yet undetermined proportion of patients with coeliac disease this will lead to adverse health outcomes and generate additional health costs. I strongly oppose the proposed changes to allow gluten levels in gluten free foods, as the proposed new gluten free standard may not be safe for those individuals who have coeliac disease. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  As part of this year's Adelaide Feast Festival, I had the opportunity to attend a Safe Schools Coalition workshop. At the forum we heard about recent Australian research which shows that 80 per cent of same-sex attracted, intersex and gender diverse students still face verbal abuse and bullying at school and that just one in five of these students attend a school in which they feel supported. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that bullying, abuse and exclusion takes a terrible emotional toll, but students also pay a price in terms of their learning. Research presented at the forum shows that same-sex attracted, intersex and gender diverse students who do not feel safe at school have lower self-esteem and higher rates of absenteeism. Their grades suffer and so does their mental health. Most tragically, they suffer much higher rates of suicide. We as a parliament know that youth suicide rates are too high, but we also know that it is our responsibility to do all we can to try and save lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a powerful force of change in our classrooms called the Safe Schools Coalition. What is most inspiring about it is that it is a program driven by students—students who have taken the task of making our schools safer upon their own shoulders and who are approaching their principals and encouraging them to get involved and who are leading the school's efforts. We heard from students who have set up petitions, who have started friendship groups, who have run fundraisers and, importantly, who have taken really meaningful steps towards educating their peers and creating a safer and more supportive environment. These students are all leaders, all brave individuals who are making a difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really incredibly proud of Labor<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s commitment to safe schools. I want to acknowledge that opposition leader, Bill Shorten, secured the funding for this program when he was the education minister. Today we know that there are already 206 safe schools nationally, including 29 in South Australia. The program will come on board across the rest of the country by the middle of 2015. I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise the incredible work of The Foundation for Young Australians, who are supporting this program across the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For too many same-sex attracted, intersex and gender diverse young Australians, school can still be a really grim place, but, thanks to this coalition, the future is looking much brighter. I have a list here of the 206 safe schools nationally which are running this program. I would encourage all MPs to contact schools in their communities if they are not on this list and encourage them to get involved. Together we can work to prevent the high rates of youth suicide which are gripping same-sex young Australians, and we can save lives. It is something worth this parliament coming together to achieve. I seek leave to table the list.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NIKOLIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I rise to say how disappointed I am that the government's higher education reforms did not pass the Senate yesterday, stymied by the Labor-Greens partners and a small number of Independents. It was a very close vote, and I am particularly disappointed because the changes would have expanded opportunities for students in my home state of Tasmania. Without these changes, the university sector is just not sustainable; the universities themselves have told us that. Despite the consensus support of the higher education sector, Labor, the Greens and a small number of Independents have ignored the necessity for reform. Bill Shorten and Labor have again failed to act responsibly and in the best interests of Australia's higher education sector. They ripped $2.3 billion out of the sector before the last election, and now they provide no alternative, just persisting with the mendacious campaign—a scare campaign—about Americanisation and the doubling and tripling of fees which even the universities themselves have repudiated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of greater concern to me is the effect on my home state of Tasmania and the link between these reforms and an innovative proposal by the University of Tasmania to enhance the Launceston and north-west campuses. I believe that proposal has great potential, and I have been working for months to promote the idea with senior colleagues like the education minister. A key reason we must change is that an unacceptably low number of Tasmanians participate in higher education. Only 6.7 per cent of Tasmanians go to university and, for the sake of our future innovation, for the sake of our prosperity, that has to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am puzzled by Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie's decision to vote against the bill. She has publicly said that she wants a better deal for the University of Tasmania yet has voted against the very means of achieving that better deal for our state. The problem is that, unless these reforms pass the Senate, the UTAS concept has no future, because it depends on a steady stream of students to make it work. You do not secure government investment in expensive infrastructure at UTAS if you do not have a growing market. Without the reform bill, without the pathway programs and that additional activity at the university of Tasmania, the business case does not stack up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current scheme, there are simply not enough funded pathway programs to make that significant investment work. Senator Lambie says that she wants to do the right thing by Tasmania and I agree with her; we must. If that is the case, I call on Senator Lambie to support the higher education reform package for the good of Tasmania when those reforms are reintroduced into the Senate. I call on Senator Lambie and the other crossbenchers to seize this opportunity to secure a sustainable higher education sector that will benefit students, particularly in areas that need it most like my home state of Tasmania.</span>

The map has just been released and it shows our area will be stuck with poor broadband quality and access until at least 2016. This is despite Minister Turnbull promising that areas that have the poorest broadband, like Point Cook, Hoppers Crossing, Little River and Laverton, will get the NBN first. In addition, there will be large areas of Werribee, Wyndham Vale, Tarneit, Truganina, and Werribee South that will also miss out. The NBN provision that is available in Lalor was commenced under the previous Labor government. This is very disappointing, especially when you consider that, in one of the minister's first speeches as the Minister for Communications, he said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has now broken that promise, and our area is paying the price for the Abbott government's lack of commitment to the promises that they made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also broken other promises that every Australian would have access to the NBN by 2016. That is clearly not the case now, despite Prime Minister Abbott saying that under the coalition by 2016 there would be minimum download speeds of 25 megabytes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we will deliver a minimum of 25 megabits … by the end of our first term.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the maps that have been released for the electorate of Lalor are saying that that is not the case. I would say that that is now another broken promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really disappointing news. It is disappointing news for families. It is disappointing news for business, because in those new areas in that growth corridor in Point Cook, Tarneit and Truganina there are new businesses and families now moving into an area that is an absolute internet black hole. We have some people on one side of the street whose developers have paid and worked with Telstra to put it through; and others who live on the other side of the street with absolutely no internet access at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Turnbull made several promises about fixing this and now we find our electorate has no new areas on the NBN rollout. As I have gone round the caucus in the last few days, I note that mine is not the only Labor electorate that is having no new NBN rollout, having no new suburbs included. The member for Adelaide just informed me as she was leaving that the same will be said for the electorate of Adelaide. I suggest strongly that Minister Turnbull relook at his maps and start thinking about the people who need this most. Kids who want to do their homework and who are reliant upon the internet need the NBN now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  In August of this year, I established the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee. I did so because I wanted to encourage open communication with today's students and tomorrow's leaders. During our initial meeting, I asked the students to identify their top three concerns. The issue of mental health in schools was one of them. Mental health is a complex topic which transcends the role of education providers, health providers, politicians and community leaders. Our youth require a robust and adaptable support network to help them deal with the rapidly changing landscape of maturing from child to adult. The Central Coast region, unfortunately, has a high rate of youth suicide. It is confronting to think of the brilliant young lives lost and the pain and suffering that families and friends must endure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To gain a better understanding of students' concerns, I facilitated a roundtable workshop on the subject of mental health in schools. Joined by representatives from headspace and Children &amp; Young People's Mental Health, we asked members of the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee to tell us what they believe the causes of stress and anxiety to be. A major concern was the role social media is playing in now bringing what were once issues contained to the schoolyard into the students' homes. Increasing access to the internet through smart technology means that today's students are connected to one another constantly during the day and night. During the workshop I was told of gang bullying conducted through Facebook and Twitter. Coupled with the option for cyberbullies to remain anonymous, we have a potentially dangerous combination of factors which can bear a heavy influence on our youth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do we go about addressing these issues of stress and anxiety amongst our students? Members of the committee advised me that one of the most important tools is peer mentoring within our schools and encouraging students to put up their hands as champions to help those struggling with anxiety and stress. To do this we should equip students with the knowledge of where to refer a friend or fellow student who may be struggling. It was said at our workshop that, 'There is nothing more powerful than kids working with kids.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lakes Grammar spoke about their innovative mental health advocacy group which was established to upskill students and identify local in-school solutions to mental health issues. The benefits of bringing different schools together for such discussion is the ability to share effective programs. I will continue to work closely with my local schools to advocate for mental health first aid resources for students so we can educate them on the factors and influences of mental health issues and the resources and assistance available.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the many local teachers I have worked with over the past year who go above and beyond their duty to provide extra assistance and support to vulnerable students. I would also like to thank Berkeley Community Vale High School for hosting our workshop, along with Mrs Helen Isenhour, Manager of headspace Gosford, and Mrs Helen Astolfi, Acting Manager of Children &amp; Young People's Mental Health, for their contribution to this very important matter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  Later today it will be my sad duty, with the Prime Minister and thousands of Australians, to attend the funeral service of Phillip Hughes. I want to speak on behalf of the government and, I think, all Australian people in saying that his untimely passing at the young age of 25 is a reminder about the life that he led, which was an amazing life. It was full of love from his family, who were supportive in his early formative years—the years that made him into the fine cricketer that he was. It is also a reminder about how fragile life can be—to be lost at the age of 25. He was on the cusp of returning to the Australian cricket team. It said to all of us that it was such an unfair outcome. Our thoughts and prayers, of course, go out to his loving parents, to his two siblings and to the Australian cricket team and all of the support staff in the team, who feel this loss as much as anybody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make special mention today of Sean Abbott, who is, again, a fine Australian cricketer, an amazing bowler and a young man with enormous talent, but he feels enormous grief and, no doubt, guilt. But he has the support of not only his team mates but, of course, the nation as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday I was at the under-nine Ferny Hills Cricket Team, where I help to part-time umpire and coach in my youngest son's cricket team. The innocence of watching those young boys wearing their black armbands, talking a lot about the loss of Phillip Hughes, was replicated at cricket clubs of all grades and all levels across the country. To me, it demonstrated the tight-knit community of cricket in this country. It is, of course, part of the Australian fabric. It has been reflected by cricketers of every generation, the names of whom Australians can instantly recall, and Phillip Hughes is amongst that company. Those young cricketers, as they went to the field, had a minute's silence and they remembered an amazing young man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Hughes, of course, will be remembered for his great ability on the field, but Michael Clarke's outpouring of emotion, which to me is a demonstration of the great character of Michael Clarke, demonstrates that Phillip was a great man off the pitch as well. I think Michael Clarke has demonstrated the skills and the great capacity that a leader of the Australian cricket team must possess—people like Simpson, Border, Benaud and all of these people that had similar characteristics. Michael Clarke has demonstrated that over the course of the last few days. He has encapsulated the feeling of a nation. He has been able to lead his team through a very difficult time. At the same time, he has been having to deal with his own grief and loss for a person whom he describes as his brother in Phillip Hughes, somebody with whom he obviously had an enormous and heartfelt connection. He will suffer today, and all of us will be reminded during the funeral service about, as I say, the preciousness of life but also the ability of this young man to transform a nation not only on the pitch but off as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to in particular say thank you very much to Cricket Australia for the support that they have provided to the players within the team but also the broader cricket community, including the support staff as well. These are people that travel together. They are a very tight-knit group of people—the players, the support staff and the team at Cricket Australia. The fact is that they have been very conscious of the emotion which is still raw within the Australian cricket team. To delay the playing schedule is a significant undertaking, but they have done that with a great level of professionalism, and I congratulate James Sutherland and his team for the way in which they have been able to provide that support. They have demonstrated ably how they have been able to accommodate those players by delaying the Brisbane test and rejigging the playing calendar with India across this summer. Full credit to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about the game of cricket, because the other day I went to a school within my electorate and I spoke to the year 7 groups about parliament, as all of us do from time to time. They ask about your parliamentary role, so they had questions about health, but predominantly they had questions about sport. In particular, they had questions about Phillip and they had questions about whether or not the game should change, whether or not helmets needed to be modified and whether or not there could be particular changes to cricket that need to be made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, these things will be discussed at a later time, at a more appropriate time. But I think it is important to put on the record the fact that, by all accounts, this is a one-in-100-year event, a freak accident. Two young cricketers were doing their very best, representing their states and representing their nation. It was a freak accident. Frankly, from the medical advice, it seems that, had that ball landed a millimetre up or down or to the left or right, it would have resulted in a very different outcome. People can have discussions around whether or not you need to have a change in the design of the helmets—all of that. I do not think that is an appropriate discussion for today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do say that cricket is a safe sport. It is an amazing sport for young people to be involved in. We see thousands, literally, of Australian kids involved in the MILO program in the junior ranks who go on to have cricket as part of their life forever. I suspect that the Australian team and Phillip Hughes in particular would want the great game of cricket to continue on unimpeded—yes, with sensible changes if they need to be made, but, most importantly, to hold the values and virtues of this great game foremost. I think that is the message that we will see in coming weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you very much to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others who have contributed to this condolence debate in the other place. I know that their thoughts and wishes and prayers for the family in particular, as I say, would be representative of the messages that thousands of Australians would want to be conveyed. In closing, I want to say thank you to the Australian public for the way in which they have provided an outpouring of grief and of support for the Australian cricket team and for the family in particular. It makes me very proud as the Minister for Sport in this country to see us represented by amazing athletes, not just in cricket but in many sports, on the track, in the pool and on ovals across the country. We are a better country for sport and for having sport as part of our DNA in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We say to young Australians that the life of Phillip Hughes, whilst cut short in his absolute prime, is a demonstration that being involved in sport in our country is in many ways to be fully immersed in Australian life. I think this is an opportunity for us all to celebrate the life of a young man who made an incredible contribution not only to club cricket but to state cricket and obviously to national and international cricket as well. He was a great ambassador. We have seen the fact that different codes and different cricket teams from around the world, who would normally be adversaries on the oval, have come together as one to unite in their grief and to say to the Australian public and to those internationally who are admirers of the game that this is a great game. It is a very important part of our life. It is a part of the formative years of many Australians. We celebrate an amazing life, but we recognise the support of those around him and in particular the grief being felt by the family and by the Australian cricket team, ably led by a great Australian in Michael Clarke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the House very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. These issues are always dealt with on a bipartisan basis. As I say, this is an opportunity for us to contribute to what is a sad affair but a celebration of a wonderful life. Thank you very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise to honour the life of Phillip Hughes and send my condolences to his family and friends. Over the past week we have seen an amazing outpouring of grief for a life tragically cut short. We have also seen a celebration of a life lived to the fullest; a life that gave joy to so many; a life that will continue to affect so many for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip was born in the beautiful New South Wales mid-North Coast town of Macksville in 1988 to parents Greg and Virginia. The son of a banana farmer, Phillip excelled in both cricket and rugby league, but his diminutive stature would always lend itself more to the gentleman's game. After wearing out the arms of Macksville's finest bowlers, Phillip followed in the footsteps of Don Bradman, Brian Booth, Glenn McGrath and so many other great Australian cricketers and made the pilgrimage from the bush to the big smoke in pursuit of the baggy green.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arriving in Sydney at the age of 17, Phillip joined the Western Suburbs District Cricket Club in Ashfield, scoring 141 not out on debut. The transition from the bush to the city could not have been more seamless, and Sydney's grade scene knew someone special had arrived. As his career progressed Phillip was selected to make his Australian debut against the might of South Africa on 26 February 2009 at new Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Against one of the great bowling attacks in modern cricket, Phillip Hughes was dismissed for a duck in his first test innings. In what was to become a recurring theme throughout his career, Phil fought back after this initial setback and scored his maiden test hundred in the first innings of the second test before adding another hundred in the second innings. In doing so at the age of 20 years and 96 days, he became both the youngest Australian since Doug Walters to score a test century and the youngest player from any country to score a century in both innings of a test match.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip would go on to be dropped four times from the Australian cricket team, and after every setback he went back to shield cricket and piled on the runs. As Australian captain Michael Clarke said of his work ethic and attitude, 'His legacy of trying to improve each and every day will drive us for the rest of our lives.' Phillip's work ethic, determination and sense of humour are traits espoused by all those who knew him—a loved young man with a cheeky grin and a determination to represent his country in the game he loved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my remarks today it would be remiss of me not to mention Sean Abbott. Sean is a young man from Sydney's north-west, who played his junior cricket with Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, not far from my electorate, before progressing to the grade cricket ranks with Parramatta and now for his state. My thoughts are with Sean. He deserves our support and indeed the support of the entire community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The passing of Phillip Hughes has obviously impacted on so many. It reminds us that life is fragile and precious. It makes parents hold their children that extra bit tighter. It reminds us that life is more important, more special and more unpredictable than any game. As Alan Stokes writes in Fairfax media, 'The loss of someone so young cannot fail to strike at any heart.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day Phillip is laid to rest I send my deepest condolences to Greg, Virginia, Megan and Jason Hughes. I cannot imagine the grief you are feeling, but know that Phillip was loved by so many. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Rest well, Phillip.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  It is always a very sobering occasion when any of us speak in this place on the loss of a great Australian, and sadly we seem to be doing that quite a lot. I cannot claim to be Australia's foremost authority on cricket, but the passing of Phil Hughes is a tragedy that has affected not just the whole of Australia but the whole of the world. As a mother of a 26-year-old son—and Phillip was due to have his 26th birthday on 30 November—I have to say that Phillip's death has rocked me to the core. I cannot imagine the grief that Phillip's parents, Virginia and Greg, and his sister, Megan, and brother, Jason, must be feeling. My heart goes out to them. As a parent you never really expect to outlive your children. From the time that they are born you watch over them, you care about their safety and you fear for their safety. I think perhaps that as mothers we have a tendency to fret about our sons' safety even when they grow into men, as they will always be our little boys. While we as parents worry about them being in a car accident or some other such accident, I do not think anyone could ever have imagined that such fatal harm could occur from a child playing a game that they loved so dearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I first heard of the news that Phillip had been injured on Tuesday, 25 November, I have discovered a great deal about what an exceptional young man he truly was. He was a young man that any parent would be proud of, that his siblings loved and cherished, that his local community admired, that his team mates respected and that we as a nation should honour. He was a great Australian. At only 25 years of age, he had 26 centuries to his name in first-class cricket. I note that the Australian Captain, Michael Clarke, said that he had no doubt that Phillip would have made 27 centuries last Tuesday and gone on to play 100 tests, such was his determination and skill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If anyone ever questioned how deeply cricket is ingrained in the Australian national psyche and how we as a nation have respond Phillip's loss, the episodes of the past week should remove any such doubt. The Melbourne Cup may be the race that stops the nation, but I believe that cricket is in the nation's soul, just like football is in the country of my parents heritage. It is a powerful legacy that is as strong today as it ever was. There are heroes and legends that have defined us from the very first Australian 11 Aboriginal cricket team to tour England in 1868, the first Ashes series in 1882, our Don Bradman, Richie Benaud, the Chappell brothers, Jeff Thomson, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh—to name just a few. I did say that I am not the most foremost authority on cricket, but I do admire and respect these great men, past and present. I have been struck by just how strongly this legacy has been expressed with the 'put out our bat' campaign to mark Phillip's passing. I have been astounded by the huge number of homes and businesses all over the electorate of Brisbane that have cricket bats of all sizes and in all states of repair placed outside them as a mark of respect. They were put there for Phillip. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip's passing is a tragedy not just for him and his family but also for another wonderful young man, 22-year-old Sean Abbott. I have been incredibly gratified at the level of consideration that has been extended to Sean for the pain and anguish that he must be feeling. I understand that Sean and Phillip had also been team mates in the New South Wales Blues. My heart goes out to Sean, who only recently made his debut in the Australian T21 one-day side. I know that Sean has the sympathy of everyone in the nation. We all hope that one day he will go on to realise his dream, as Phillip did, of wearing the baggy green. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From everything that I have read about Phillip, he was never one to let a setback keep him down or dampen his spirit. If there is a heaven then I am sure he is there now—another great Australian teaching them how to play cricket. </span>

Later today in Macksville on the New South Wales north coast, he will be farewelled. That is an occasion for which Australia will stop and pause. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />This tragedy has had an enormous impact on Australians. Cricket is our national game. It is a pastime where people, young and old, participate either by playing or by watching. The shock that someone who was so well known to Australians could lose their life so tragically is one that has had a profound impact on the nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed) </span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALBANESE:</span>
                  </a>  Phil Hughes was someone who I had the honour of meeting on a number of occasions. He played for Western Suburbs District Cricket Club as his local team, which is based in Pratten Park in my electorate. Phil Hughes was someone who always had time for the youngsters who played cricket there, from Milo cricket up to the district competition. My son was one of those young people who played cricket based at Pratten Park, for Summer Hill Cricket Club. My son was also a left-handed batsman. I think you can tell a lot about someone who is a star—and make no mistake: Phil Hughes was a superstar—by how they approach a young kid who nervously comes up to them and asks for a bit of advice or just to say hello. Phil Hughes gave batting tips to my son. I well recall him giving my son a bat and asking him about his stance and giving him a bit of advice that was gentle, considered and humble. This was a bloke who was a country cricketer based in the relatively small town of Macksville, which will be mourning today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil Hughes is someone who never got ahead of himself. In spite of his setbacks—four times dropped and then returned to the Australian cricket team; he played 12th man and he spent a lot of time in the dressing room as well as on the field—he never thought that that was not good enough for him. The way that he approached the youngsters, not just my son but the youngsters coming up through the Western Suburbs teams at Ashfield, to me indicated the character of the man. It was absolutely of no surprise to me the impact that his passing has had on Michael Clarke, who has shown extraordinary leadership during this difficult time, and on the rest of his teammates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I also acknowledge the trauma that Sean Abbott must be going through. Sean Abbott was just doing his job as a bowler, and there could have been no expectation of this tragedy. I have seen a lot of cricket over the years. You just do not expect that someone will be seriously hurt, let alone lose their life, when a ball comes down the pitch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Hughes was someone you wanted to watch. He is someone you wanted to be in the team because of the quality of his cricket. He is someone who was unorthodox, someone who was not a graceful player like a Mark Waugh or a Greg Chappell. He had an unorthodox technique but he was extraordinarily effective and fantastic to watch, particularly his play through the offside. Memories of his driving and his cuts are something that will remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that these statements are being made in the House—and that today he will be honoured by the presence of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others at his farewell—says a lot about the impact that he had during his all-too-short time on this planet. I today express my condolences to his family, to his teammates in the Australian cricket team and the South Australian team, to his former teammates in New South Wales and to the Western Suburbs cricket club in my electorate. He had an enormous impact on all those who watched him but also an enormous impact on all those who had the privilege to meet him.</span>

                  <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I consider it an honour to speak in the debate on these statements of condolence on behalf of many people across the Corangamite electorate who have been touched by the untimely death of Phillip Hughes. It really has been incredibly moving to see the tributes over the past week and the cricket bats outside parliament and outside the homes of so many local people in my electorate. I visited one of my good friends Patrice Savage the other day. Her boys love playing cricket, and there was the cricket bat outside her home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later today the Macksville community and the cricket family will join together to farewell this inspirational young man. I wish Phillip's family and friends all the very best as they come to grips with what is an utter tragedy at this very, very difficult time. His death has touched not only friends, family, coaches and cricketers, both young and old, but people from all walks of life, all corners of Australia and around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think perhaps there are a number of reasons why Phillip's death has particularly reverberated so strongly. He was so incredibly young, just days out from his 26th birthday. I think his death is a poignant reminder that one cruel twist of fate is all that it takes to take someone away that we hold so dear in such an instant. There are so many people across Australia who love their sport and who love their cricket, and we watch and admire cricketers across the nation, as we have for many years, with such a degree of emotion. We watch the successes and the failures, and there is a very deep connection with the emotions of the players. I think it has been particularly difficult to watch Phillip's teammates come to terms with his passing without deeply feeling that loss ourselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Hughes was capable of playing world-beating cricket. He made two test centuries against South Africa and one against Sri Lanka, as well as two one-day international centuries, also against Sri Lanka. And who could forget his memorable partnership with Ashton Agar in England in July last year. Ashton Agar stole the show that day with a score of 98 on debut—an incredible effort—but it would not have been possible without the leadership and the level-head of Phillip Hughes, who finished the innings unbeaten on 81. In first-class cricket Phillip maintained an average of 46.51, with 26 tons and 46 fifties. Australians love an underdog, and there would have been few things sweeter than to see this young man make his return to the test team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first test of the summer, against India, was due to start tomorrow. But for a few millimetres, Phillip Hughes might have had his chance to finally cement himself in the national team. That we will no longer see him strapping on the pads and striding to the crease is a very sombre thought. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point I want to reflect on the words of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who said a number of days ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">People are not supposed to die playing our national game. Sport is supposed to engender pride, not grief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Phillip's family, to his friends and to cricketers young and old, this is a very, very sad loss for our nation and a loss that has reverberated around the world. Rest in peace, Phillip Hughes—63 not out forever.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  Today will be a very sad day for many Australians as we commemorate the life and the tragic death of cricketer Phillip Hughes. Phillip Hughes was not a soldier who died in service for his country nor was he a hero who died trying to save others, but his death has greatly affected our nation and touched something within many, many Australians. It is appropriate that we acknowledge this grief in this chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All loss of life is tragic. Family and friends will mourn the loss of loved ones deeply, regardless of whether the nation and the media spotlight accompanies them. But in this case the Australian public, and particularly the Australian cricketing community, are in mourning with Phil Hughes's family, friends and teammates because we feel a shared loss. The public loss of such an enormous talent and such enormous potential feels especially bitter to us all. We all know how much more Phillip Hughes had to offer Australian cricket. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be small consolation for his family and friends, but Phillip Hughes will long live on in Australian cricketing folklore. Like Archie Jackson, another cricketing prodigy—who died of tuberculosis at just 23 years of age 80 years ago and who still lives on in the imagination of the cricket obsessed 10-year-olds across our country—Phillip Hughes will hold a special place in Australia's collective cricketing memory. I will tell my children how, at just 20 years of age, Hughes scored centuries in both innings of just his second test match in South Africa—becoming the youngest player in history to achieve this feat—punching the South African pace attack through the offside again and again. I will tell them how I sat glued to the television throughout the night watching Hughes and another brilliant young Australian cricketer—Ashton Agar—compile a world-record last-wicket stand of 163 runs, with Hughes giving Ashton Agar every opportunity to score a century on debut, which would have been magical for a number 11, and falling just two runs short. It was truly one of the most extraordinary cricketing partnerships I have ever seen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I will tell my children that if Hughes had lived long enough to receive another act, another chance as a test cricketer, he would have surely followed in the footsteps of other brilliant young talents like Steve Waugh, Matthew Hayden and Damien Martin, who came back from periods outside the test team to achieve even greater feats in the baggy green. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />The fact that this public loss of Phillip Hughes—and the loss of his great potential and talent—occurred in the most prosaic circumstances, while he was doing something that so many thousands of cricket-playing Australians have done many times over, makes it that much more personally affecting for us all. The way in which the 'put out your bats' phenomenon has taken hold in the days following his death is a testament to this feeling of shared loss in the Australian community. Since Sydney father Paul Taylor placed his cricket bat at his front door and tweeted the image in Hughes's honour, thousands of Australians and sports lovers from all around the world have joined in in this act of respect to demonstrate their appreciation for Phillip Hughes in a tangible way. As Taylor explained: <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">We</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">ve all played cricket in one way or another …We</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">ve all grown up with a bat and ball. This is our way to connect and show our sadness.</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We find our sense of community as Australians both when we want to celebrate and when we need to mourn, and in this way it is pleasing to see how the Australian cricketing community has embraced Sean Abbott, the bowler who had the pure bad luck to have delivered the fateful ball. We all know that Sean Abbott bears no responsibility for what has occurred, but we also know that he will be suffering more than we can imagine at this point, wondering the little things that he may have changed on the day. Our thoughts are with him at this time. He bears no responsibility and he has our this full support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note the way that the Australian cricket captain, Michael Clarke, and Cricket Australia have managed this extraordinarily traumatic event. The deferral of the first test match showed appropriate consideration for the welfare of the Australian players dealing with the loss of a friend and work colleague. The decision to adjust Phillip Hughes's final scorecard to record him as being 63 not out forevermore is an especially apt, symbolic gesture. Symbols matter at times like this, and that little asterisk beside his name will be a potent symbol and a reminder for the generations of cricketing Australians to come of what the Australian cricket community has lost in the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I rise to speak in condolence at this very sad time. Today will mark the funeral of Phil Hughes, and many in this place will take the opportunity to reflect on his contribution. When he made his debut for his country in February 2009, there had only been 408 Australians—privileged, nay, talented Australians—who had had the privilege of donning the baggy green cap. As we heard from the previous speaker, almost every Australian boy—and, increasingly, Australian girl—grows up playing cricket, aspiring to one day wear the baggy green. I can tell you that I was such a young man. I spent much of my youth juggling my responsibilities scholastically with a love of cricket and the game. I shared that love with my brother, who was 11 years older than me, and I was privileged enough to play cricket at a reasonably senior level. Unlike Phillip Hughes, who had the talent to play for his country, I did not, but it is the fact that he was playing our national game when he was taken from us which I think has caused his plight to resonate so deeply with the Australian psyche.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A life well lived can be measured in years or it can be measured in quality, and I think it is important to note at this time that a life well lived is indeed a ripe old age. If one lives their life well and to the fullest, one can take solace in the fact that they have lived to a ripe old age, even if they are taken far too soon as Phillip Hughes was. We heard from the Prime Minister earlier this week. He said—and I will repeat his words—that Phillip Hughes's death 'has so affected people because it happened in the midst of life, at its most exuberant'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a man who had played for his country, whose unconventional technique had made him both a local hero and someone that the ordinary Australian could relate so clearly to. He had gotten on top of his technical difficulties and was returning to the field and, quite frankly, was slated to play for Australia and to continue his test career. We could sit here and speak about his statistical record, his 26 tests and his 25 one-day internationals, but this story now speaks a lot larger than that. His passing reminds us that life is both precious and fragile. I, like the previous speaker, have held in my thoughts ever since last Thursday Sean Abbott, who did nothing more than play the game we love and play it as hard as Phil Hughes would have wanted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that he be marked as 63 not out. Symbols really do matter. I am pleased to see that across our nation we have seen the phenomenon of 'putting your bats out'. I am pleased to report that amateur cricket in my electorate of Barker continued on the weekend. Not only did players don black armbands, but they all paused to reflect on the tragic loss of Phil Hughes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all had opportunity to understand more of the Phil Hughes story since his tragic passing. I noted with some interest that he was a country lad. He shares that with me. He had a great love of cattle, and stud cattle in particular. Like Phil Hughes, I hope one day to leave this place and retire to a farming property. Like me, Phillip has Italian heritage, in his case through his mother, Virginia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know something about loss. Whilst my sympathies are with Phillip's mother, Virginia, and his father, Greg, I cannot pretend to know their pain. What I do know acutely is the pain that Jason and Megan, his siblings, are sharing right now. I know it because I have lived it. I say to them: you will never forget—as this nation will never forget—the contribution your brother has made, but you personally will never forget him. You wake up most mornings thinking of him. From time to time during the day you will think, 'What would Phil do in this situation?' From time to time you will think, 'How would Phil have coped with this?' The reality is that you never recover from a loss of this nature. You learn to live with it but you will not recover from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only have cricket clubs throughout my electorate reflected and acknowledged this sad passing, my own cricket club, the South Gambier Cricket Club, which I maintain membership of, was very keen to acknowledge the passing of Phil Hughes. I spoke to a number of players before they took the field on Saturday and remarked to many of them, many of whom I have played cricket with for a decade, that was has shocked them is the fact that we play our national sport and play it hard, but none of us ever thinks that will be the last act in the drama of life. I think that is why this event has so shocked the Australian psyche.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil was a great cricketer. He was a great Australian. Much more importantly than that, he was the best of people taken at his most exuberant, as the Prime Minister described it. Vale Phil Hughes. My sympathies go to his family. My sympathies go to his team-mates. I am grateful that, as a nation, we have acknowledged his passing in the most appropriate of ways. We probably will not see his equal again. He was an unconventional batsman who had a raw talent who has been taken from us far too soon. As a nation, we have been robbed of his talents. To his family and his team-mates I send my deepest condolences. May he rest in peace. May he enjoy cricket for the rest of his days in that oval in the sky, and join other Australian and international greats playing the game they love for all eternity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RIPOLL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  I rise today, like so many in this place, to pay my respects and speak on the condolence motion for Phillip Joel Hughes, an outstanding cricketer taken far too soon doing what he loved best. Phillip was born on 30 November 1988 in the small New South Wales town of Macksville. Today in Macksville the funeral and memorial will be held for this very young man, aged just 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip started playing cricket as a junior in Macksville, where his undoubted talent quickly shone through. At the age of 17 he moved to Sydney to play for Western Suburbs District Cricket Club, having in front of him a most brilliant career. Phillip played two seasons with New South Wales in first-class cricket before making his test debut for Australia in 2009 against South Africa, at the age of only 20. He was the 408th person to play test cricket for Australia. It was an illustrious achievement in his career to have been the 408th cap in what is such a  special and small club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just his second test match, at the age of 20, he scored a century in the first innings before scoring a further century in the second innings, making him the youngest test cricketer in history to score a century in both innings of a test match. Phillip played 26 test matches during his career and scored 1,535 runs with a batting average of 32.66—a great achievement. He also played 25 one-day international matches for Australia and scored 826 runs with a batting average of 35.91. He was the first Australian batsman in the history of one-day international cricket to score a hundred on debut. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But all the numbers and all the great achievements never tell the full story. Like all players, Phillip went through some peaks and some troughs—as we all do in life and through our careers—and experienced good and bad times. Those who knew him well have noted the remarkable way that he dealt with those inevitable setbacks and maintained his dignity and his friendships and built a fantastic career at such an early age. His determination to work harder and improve, because he loved playing for his country and had more to offer the game, is a tribute to his attitude as a professional sportsperson and character as a human being. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, while playing for South Australia against New South Wales, he compiled 63 runs and was undoubtedly reminding the nation and the national selectors of his talent. What happened next was as unexpected as it was tragic and sad. On Thursday, 27 November 2004, Phillip passed away as a result of the injuries that he suffered from being struck by a cricket ball. There is no doubt that Phillip's injury and death has struck a very deep chord in all of us in this parliament, in his home town, in cricket, in Australia and much, much further. Right across the world, it seems to have struck a chord in terms of who Phillip was but also in the tragic way that life can be taken from us in the most unexpected of circumstances—in a game that is not meant to have an element of danger that would result in somebody losing their life, or as we go about our daily business, doing what we do best, working, playing, living our lives and not really contemplating that at any moment somebody could be taken away from us. What we have seen is this outpouring of tributes, not just from close friends and team mates but from ordinary Australians who would not have known Phillip Hughes apart from seeing him on the television but who really felt this connection—some affinity, some loss within themselves—which is why they are grieving as well as his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the weekend, local cricketers paid tribute to Phillip in many different ways and ordinary people put out their bats to honour his memory. Today, also, I am thinking of Sean Abbott—many other people who I know are thinking of Sean Abbott—a young man who has done nothing wrong and, simply by bowling a cricket ball, has been caught up in this tragedy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of all the tributes about his career on the pitch, Phillip was a son, a brother and, in many respects, an ordinary person like the rest of us, albeit an extraordinary one. Having recently experienced loss myself, like so many people in this House, you know that all of those things cannot possible replace the loss that you feel. I know that today his family and his closest friends will be confronting their deepest fears about that loss—his parents, brother, sister, friends and everybody. I extend my deepest sympathies, particularly to his parents, Greg and Virginia, and siblings, Megan and Jason—to know the difficulty they will be facing. There is no doubt that Phillip will remain in the memory of all Australians, No. 408, forever 63 not out. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  The outpouring of grief across Australia, and indeed across the globe, as many members have said, is quite remarkable—everyone is paying their respects to an inspirational young man who touched the lives not just of people in our nation but across the globe. So I rise today to speak on behalf of the people of Solomon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip was deeply respected by Territorians, as he was nationally and internationally. Territorians remember him with great fondness. It is no secret that Territorians love their sport, and cricket, along with AFL, is one of the sports that we love the most. The Territory was honoured to host Phillip Hughes, and many children were able to learn from his spectacular cricket skills earlier this year, when he visited my electorate to announce the upgrades to Northline Oval that enabled us to host the quadrangular one-day series in Darwin and Palmerston. That meant that we were able to host players of the calibre of Phillip Hughes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many have said in this place, Phillip Hughes was an outstanding cricketer and, by all accounts, an outstanding person—and there have been lots of media stories about what an outstanding young man he was, not just on the cricket field but in his personal life. He will be forever remembered as a national hero because he made Australians proud, not just because of his ability as a fantastic sportsman but because of the way that he conducted himself in his life. He will be remembered not for how he died but for how he played Australia's favourite game.</span>

No-one holds you responsible. It will be a tough day for you as well. To Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan, I hope you all find comfort in knowing that our nation mourns with you.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  I rise to speak in this debate as a cricket tragic, as somebody who grew up in Macksville and attended the same schools in Macksville as Phillip Hughes—he attended the Macksville Public School and the Macksville High School—and as a person whose family still lives in the Nambucca Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the first test that Phillip Hughes starred in. At that particular time, I was visiting my mother. We talked about how wonderful it was to have somebody from Macksville, from the area that she lived in and the area that my sister and her sons live in, starring on the world stage in cricket. The pride that the people in the Nambucca Valley had in the achievements of Phillip Hughes was enormous. My nephews used to talk to me about how they would go up to Macksville and go to the pub up there; how they would all stand there and have drinks with Phillip, and he was still the same guy that he had been in the past; and how committed he was to that local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how that community are hurting. I know how they will feel. I know how devastated they are by the loss of one of their favourite sons, somebody who has achieved at the absolute highest level of cricket and somebody who was on the doorstep of coming back into the Australian cricket team. He will always have that very special place within the community of Macksville and the Nambucca Valley. He will be one of the heroes of that area. He will become a legend. He will be talked about for decades to come, centuries to come, as he will within the history of cricket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not go through his achievements. I know there have been many, many people that have stood up and talked about his fantastic double century, his achievements in the Sheffield Shield, his achievements in county cricket, his achievements in one-day cricket—his achievements in all levels of cricket. But the one thing that I really want noted in this House is how important he has been in the psyche and the history of that little town that people are gathering in today, a little town of just over 2,000 people, which will really swell today; how people will gather in that school hall at Macksville High School; and the enormous sadness that will pervade that town. I think I read that the shops will be closing their doors this afternoon. That is a true Macksville tradition. That is a community getting behind somebody that is very special to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to expressing my sympathy for the town, I would like to express my sympathy for Phillip's family. They would really be hurting today, as will his fellow cricketers. To see their son starring, to see their son achieving, to see their son so vital, to see their son so full of life, to be just a few days short of his birthday—one minute he is this vibrant young man who is achieving at the highest level, and the next minute his life is taken from him. What that does is show us just what a precious gift of life is—how each and every one of us can end up just like Phillip Hughes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the thing that is so special about Phillip is that he really epitomises what Australians look to when they look to their sporting heroes. He really has done so much not only for cricket but for young people, going along and coaching when he was not playing, and telling young people always to 'go for your best shot'. I suspect that that is what Philip was doing when that ball hit him—going for his best shot—and that bouncer came up and caught him unaware.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting that there have only been a hundred such deaths before, and two of those have been in cricket. I know that Cricket Australia and cricket worldwide are looking at the helmets. That is a good move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes there are things that you just cannot account for. Sometimes things just happen. This is one of those events. This is an accident that nobody can be blamed for and one that will pull the cricketing community closer. Sixty-three not out—that is fantastic—and the retirement of his shirt are all great tributes to Phillip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there is Sean Abbott—a young man whose cricket was blossoming and for whom the tragedy is amplified over and over. One the one hand, he could have been hit for six but, on this occasion, the ball just bounced the wrong way. My thoughts are with Sean Abbott. I hope that he continues to strive in his cricketing career. I know that Phillip Hughes and the other members of the Australian team would want him to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip's colleagues in Australian cricket will be doing it tough today as will his parents and family. This is a time to remember his family, friends, the cricketing fraternity, and the community of Macksville and the Nambucca Valley.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I rise to lend my voice to the millions who have grieved since the tragic death of Phillip Hughes. We all feel the loss of a life cut short. There is no rationalising this event. This was a terrible accident. For this brilliant and talented young man to have been taken from his us in the midst of playing our national sport seems unimaginable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil Hughes was born in Macksville New South Wales to Greg and Virginia. He grew up with a love of sport and excelled at a young age. His passion and skill led him, on the cusp of his 19th birthday, to become the youngest New South Wales debutant since Michael Clarke in 1999. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, Hughes was rewarded for his achievements by winning the New South Wales Rising Star Award. And following his wondrous debut to competitive cricket, Phil Hughes became only the 408th man to be given the honour of pulling on the baggy green cap and playing test cricket for his country. His achievements did not end there as he went on to become the youngest cricketer in history to score centuries in both innings of a test match.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been deeply moved to witness the national and indeed international response to this event. Sport has forever been our unifying factor, and this has been made evident in our reaction. Families have joined together to honour Phil by placing cricket bats outside their front doors and tributes have been left at local cricket clubs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we as a nation will come together to support Phillip's family and community. We will take an hour from our day and celebrate Phillip's life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil will be unquestionably remembered for his cricketing prowess and his love of the game, but the words of his teammates, friends and family over the past week have revealed a much admired and loved young man. Every image shown has seen him smiling. This is how we should remember him—for how he lived, loved and played.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cricket is more than a sport. The term 'cricket' is the embodiment of fairness, sportsmanship, accepting the umpire's decision, the bravery to face a fast ball, and the bravery to choose to hook. What happened to Phil was not fair. Phil will remain in our hearts indelibly. Phillip will remain in the very soul of cricket as long as it is played.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  On behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith, I wish to pay tribute to Phillip Hughes who passed away tragically on 27 November. The Australian summer is defined by three things: the beach, the barbecue and cricket. It is part of Australian culture. In summer, our kids' heroes are those who wear the baggy green. Phil Hughes was Australian hero No. 408. He was characteristic of a true Australian opening batsman—unassuming, small in stature but big in heart, with a fierce determination to score runs for his country. And score runs he did. In his second test, he scored a century, at the age of 20—115 against South Africa in Durban. In the second innings of that test, he scored 160 and became the youngest cricketer in history to score centuries in both innings of a test match. In 2013 he made a century on debut in his first one-day international game, against Sri Lanka. Like many of Australia's great batsmen, Hughes battled for his place in the Australian side. He was dropped four times, but he showed characteristic guts and determination to make his way back into the team. On 27 November this year, on 63, he was on his way to a century and what many believe would have been another test call-up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hughes was the quintessential Aussie cricketer. Born in Macksville on the North Coast of New South Wales, he was also a very good rugby league player and played beside none other than Greg Inglis. Greg Inglis last week, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier-Mail</span>, recalled the boy who would get up the noses of his opponents and mates when nobody could get him out in a cricket match. Greg Inglis said that Phil Hughes was always destined to play for Australia. He played A grade in the local competition at the age of 12. At 17 he came to Sydney and began grade cricket with the Western Suburbs club. In 2007 he was selected for the under-19 Australian World Cup squad. In 2007-08 he was selected to play for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield. Like many Australian cricketers, he also did a stint in England, in county cricket, playing for Middlesex, Hampshire and Worcestershire. Towards the end of his career, he was paying Sheffield Shield cricket for South Australia. Phil Hughes played 26 tests for Australia and scored 1,535 runs, with an average of 32.65.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The outpouring of grief and sorrow that we have seen throughout Australia, from not only his team mates, friends and family but also the Australian public, has been remarkable and is testament to the high regard in which he was held and his tenacity and spirit for the game of cricket. David Warner, a constituent of Kingsford Smith, was one of Phillip's greatest mates and sat beside Phil as he was taken from the SCG on a medicab and later to St Vincent's Hospital. His feelings are reflected in the sorrow that people in the community of Kingsford Smith are feeling at the moment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil Hughes represents our love of cricket and our love of cricketers. Our thoughts and prayers are with his team mates, in particular Sean Abbott. On behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith, I say to Sean Abbott: know that you are not at all at fault in respect of this tragic accident; know that you have the support and encouragement of the nation; and know that we hope that you play on in your cricketing career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I would like to pay tribute to the cricketing community in Kingsford Smith—to the players, the family and friends, the officials and the fans who have given touching tributes to Phil Hughes and his family. I am deeply proud to represent the sentiments of our community in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I think Richie Benaud summed up perfectly the feelings of the nation when he said last week: 'A boy just beginning, 25 years of age, baggy green No. 408. His father's best mate. Son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration. Phillip Hughes, forever rest in peace, son.' I offer my condolences to Phillip Hughes's family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I too rise to support the Prime Minister's motion that the House records its regret for the tragic loss of Phillip Hughes, one of Australia's elite sportsmen and, in the words of Australia's national cricket captain, Michael Clarke, 'one of its great blokes'. On behalf of the electorate of Swan in Western Australia, where there are many cricket clubs—particularly South Perth Cricket Club, which is one of the biggest junior cricketing clubs in Australia—I express our deep sorrow that Australia has lost one of its cricket players, one of its cricket team, one of the nation's heroes who wore the baggy green with such pride. He could only inspire you as he plied his trade when he went out onto the grounds and played his heart out not only for himself but for his team mates and for his nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day of 27 November 2014 will go down in history as a dark day for cricket and for sport, and for Australia. It is the day that our nation last an amazing talent; but, first and foremost, it is the day that Phillip Hughes's family lost a son and a brother, and his friends lost an irreplaceable mate. While Hughes's family and friends, his team mates and members of the community, both in Australia and internationally, mourn this tragic loss of life, we hope that some of this grief may be lifted by knowing that we lost this young man while he was playing the sport that he loved. We do not expect such tragedies to occur in sport, particularly not in a game that brings friends, communities and nations together, recognising players' hard work, their dedication and their ability to achieve what many of us can only dream about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, sport, particularly cricket, which is our national sport, has the ability to bring people together from all walks of life. In some of the citizenship ceremonies I go to where people becoming Australian citizens are from other cricketing nations, I always emphasise to them that the true test of their citizenship will be that they now support the Australian cricket team. It is a sport that people just love. You can talk about the statistics. You can look at all the different shots that go through. Unfortunately, most players, even after a test century, always remember the shot that gets them out, not the shots that got them their test century. There is so much variety and there are so many aspects to that sport that people can talk about for hours in the pub and enjoy it and relive those moments and look at the statistics and the history of that sport. It has such a great ability to bring people together in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend, I joined some mates of mine to recognise the 30-year anniversary of the formation of the Floreat Aquatic Recreation Cricket Club. Since its inception, the club has lost three members: Ray Bully Smith, to cancer at an early age; Ian 'Jughead' Jones, to a heart attack last year; and Ken Screech, recently, to cancer as well. In each instance, when these members have passed away, the club has rallied, coming together to remember and celebrate their lives. On a much grander scale, across the nation, that is what we are seeing with the loss of Phil Hughes to our sport, our cricket team and our ability to cheer him on as he plied his trade, making runs for his beloved country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The three members of the Floreat cricket club that I mentioned who have passed away will be remembered by the club in the same way that Phil Hughes will be remembered by our nation—but certainly not for their cricketing ability, as Phil Hughes will be remembered for his. They were in no way in the same class as Phil. They were prime examples, though, of mateship, fun and piss-taking that sport and particularly cricket instigates in our nation. Sport is known for its camaraderie. The mateship that we have all seen displayed by Hughes's teammates could only be described as uplifting, during such a time of tragedy. All Australian cricket players, both nationally and in state teams, have joined together to pay tribute to and to honour a man who left this world far too early. These tributes have also been reflected all over the world, including from our head of state, the Queen—which is a true testament to the life he led.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this time to commend Cricket Australia for their recognition that this is a tough time for their players, and for the immediate steps they took to ensure that all players had access to grief counselling. I would also commend their rescheduling of the test series, to give players the time they need to grieve. I commend Australia's cricket captain, Michael Clarke, for the leadership he has shown to players; for the support he has given to Hughes's family; and for the respect he conveyed to his teammate and—in his words—his brother, in his own personal tribute to Hughes on what would have been his 26th birthday, last Sunday. As Michael Clarke said, his cricketing achievements, of which there were many, really play second fiddle to the human qualities that he exhibited—loyal to a fault, eternally optimistic and kind-hearted, with a wicked sense of humour and a childlike verve for life. It is for these qualities that he will forever be remembered by his friends and family. But I am sure he would be happy to have his on-field achievements recognised too, and we have heard many of those from other members here today, including his three centuries, seven half-centuries, and his total of 1,535 test runs in 26 tests.</span>

                  </a>  While I have made reference to the cricketing world, it is of course the Hughes family who have suffered the most since that fateful day on 25 November when Phillip was felled by a bouncer at the Sydney Cricket Ground. When a parent is forced to carry the burden of burying their child, it is as though the world has been turned upside down. Thankfully this remains the exception rather than the rule in our society, but for those who are struck by such tragedy life can never be the same. Time may help, but a parent can never truly heal from such a heartbreak. I take this moment to pay my respects to the Hughes family—Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan—whose world, within a few moments, collapsed around them. It is my hope that knowing every Australian is thinking of you brings you some comfort at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly I would also like to pay tribute to Sean Abbott. Although I, along with all of those members who have spoken before me, cannot begin to imagine what he is feeling, our thoughts are also with him. The death of Phillip Hughes was both a tragic and extraordinary circumstance which has shaken the sporting world. While we remember Hughes for his talent on the field, we also pay tribute to the man he was off the field. With his love of the game and quick wit echoed by each of his teammates over the past week, I am sure he will be looking down on his friends and family and forever making the claim that he is still not out—a sentiment that I am sure every Australian would be happy to applaud.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I too join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other members in extending my condolences to Phillip Hughes's family. Last weekend was the annual parliamentary versus press gallery cricket match. Like cricket fixtures all around the country—including my grandson's under-9s game in Campbelltown—we started with a minute's silence, and everyone played with black armbands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragic death of Phil Hughes has seen one of the greatest outpourings of grief. It is not just among those of us who are cricketing enthusiasts; it is throughout our nation. Indeed, we are seeing it across the globe. Phil Hughes died as result of a very freakish cricketing accident in a Sheffield Shield match last week, when he was struck on the neck from a bouncer delivered by a pace bowler. Cricket, like most sports at the elite level, certainly has a high degree of risk and implicit dangers. It is why we celebrate our champions who excel at that level of the game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, quite frankly, players are regularly injured as a result of being struck by the ball. Miraculously, only a handful of players and now one umpire have been killed by a cricket ball in the game's long history. Given the nature of this accident—and I note the comments of other members—we should not forget about the dreadful impact that this has had on the bowler, Sean Abbott, who, it must be stressed, has done nothing wrong. He bowled a bouncer at a well-positioned opening batsman, who was well set in his innings having already scored 63. It has been the practice throughout the game that fast bowlers try to disrupt a batsman's thoughts by forcing him to play a shot that he was not planning to make. We can only hope that, not before too long, Sean is able to recover his composure and take his place in the New South Wales squad and to hopefully continue on his quest to be included in the Australian team. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil Hughes is the first test player to suffer this fate, although there have been several near misses. In 1975, New Zealander's medium pacer Edwin Chatfield was struck in the temple, and his heart stopped. Fortunately, he recovered and went on to play another 42 tests. Phil Hughes, as everyone has already indicated, was a very talented sportsman right from childhood. He was a most talented batsman and set records right from the start. He made his debut as a test player at age 20. He was awarded the baggy green, No. 408, when Australia played against South Africa, in Durban, in 2009. He set a record on his debut, scoring centuries in both innings. That is a pretty significant achievement for a 20-year-old. As so often happens with cricket players and those of other sports, Phil showed himself in and out of form, but his more recent successes in first-class cricket, his batting in the Sheffield Shield side for South Australia, saw him widely spoken about to be recalled to the test team. He was clearly a very talented young sportsperson. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That Phil was taken out like that at age 25 is just beyond belief. As the former speaker, the member for Swan, indicated, it certainly goes against the grain from any parent's perspective to have to bury your child. That is not the way life in our society normally works, regardless of whether or not you are a sports hero. For a father, for a mother, it is almost beyond belief. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As everyone has already indicated, Phil Hughes was one of those really likeable larrikins. He was well admired amongst his team players and he did a lot of work in the community. When he was in the New South Wales squad, he used to spend a lot of time with schoolkids, helping to teach them the finer points of the game. He was one of those youngsters who knew that he was on the way up but who wanted to take a very clear role in giving back by encouraging others to follow him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to mention the Australian captain, Michael Clarke. He has shown considerable maturity in the way in which he has conducted himself, not only in the way he has reflected the feelings of his team at this very sad time but also in the way he has channelled the grief of our nation. For me, Michael Clarke has shone like a beacon, with his long bedside vigil—he hardly left Phil Hughes's side for the two days that he was in hospital—and the dignity and the compassion that he displayed in delivering the final announcement of Phil Hughes's death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Hughes family, I offer the condolences of my community. May Phil Hughes rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIGGS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I wanted to make a short contribution to this debate. It has been a terribly sad week, since last Tuesday when we all saw the horrific incident which took Phillip Hughes's life. In saying 'the horrific incident', it was an incident which happens quite regularly on the cricket field. In fact, I got hit about five centimetres away from that same spot in my last game of district cricket, which broke my jaw. I think it brought home just how lucky we are—every day, in a lot of ways—and just how terribly unlucky Phillip Hughes was for that one spot in his head to have been hit and for it to have taken his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was an outstanding cricketer who was progressing to become, I think, an even better cricketer. I think, probably because of the focus on AFL and the physical nature of AFL football, we look at people playing that game, and when they get to 25 or 26 they are getting to the mid-to-later part of their career. Cricketers, I think, often get a lot better as they get older. And I think with Phillip Hughes you were seeing a maturity develop with his batting and his cricket, which would have meant he would have contributed much more significantly in the future. In saying that, he was an outstanding junior cricketer. Anyone who plays under 19's for their country is an outstanding junior cricketer. He travelled from country New South Wales to the Western Suburbs District Cricket Club in Sydney to pursue his dream. I went from Mildura to Adelaide to play cricket with Glenelg to pursue a dream; he was far better than I was. It is a trip that many young Australians take, particularly those from regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cricket is a game which was invented in heaven and will be played in heaven even better now, with Phillip Hughes as part of the starting 11. His death, I think, has shown how important cricket is to our culture. The reaction in the last week, with a simple tweet from a man in Sydney about putting out your bats and the reaction that got, was quite extraordinary. It is a game that pretty much everyone in our country plays at some point in their life, whether it be seriously and to the level of wanting to play for Australia or whether it be on Christmas Day in a backyard. Pretty much everyone has picked up a cricket bat and played a version of the game. It touches our lives enormously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what you saw last week, and what we will see today, is that sport is more than just a recreation. It is a community builder; it brings people together. We can all share in the grief because whether you knew him well, whether you were as close to him as Michael Clarke, or whether you were just an admirer or someone who knows about the importance of the game, it has brought everyone to this grief that we all share. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I share the sentiments of all the members who have talked about Sean Abbott. Of course, we feel for what that young man is going through as well, and we hope that he is able to find peace and recover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Clarke, I think, has shown absolutely outstanding leadership in the last week, not just with the bedside vigil that the member for Werriwa mentioned but with the statement he made on Saturday morning, which was one of the most brutal things I have ever seen on live television; it was horrific. That moment, I think, encapsulated the grief that we all share as a community, and he deserves as much credit as he is rightly getting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a very sad occasion. Cricket will go on and life will go on, but it will not be the same. We have lost a very bright young man—a very talented young man—and it is a reminder of just how precious life is. Rest in peace, Phillip Hughes.</span>

                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  Phillip Hughes played 26 test matches, made 26 first-class centuries and died just days before his 26th birthday, following a freak accident while playing for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales last week. Phillip Hughes's death was the result of terrible luck. The injury that he suffered was an incredibly rare one, with only a hundred cases having been identified in the medical literature and only one previously in a cricket match. Phillip Hughes is not the only one suffering from this bad luck. Sean Abbott, who bowled the bouncer that struck Hughes, was simply doing his job as a fast bowler, providing a gripping contest between the speed and aggression of bowler and the bravery and skill of batsman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Luck, good or bad, plays a greater role in our lives than we would often like to admit. This is no less true of cricket, the game that is often claimed to be a metaphor for life. In their analysis of cricketer performances, economists Shekhar Aiyar and Rodney Ramcharan look at debuts. They look at players whose test debut was at home and those whose test debut was overseas. It is a stroke of luck where you debut, but they find that the challenges are quite different. So an Indian batsman who debuts at home expects the cracks that emerge on Indian pitches in the later days of a test match but might not be prepared for Australia's bouncier wickets. It turns out that, if you debut at home, you score one third more runs and, over your career, one fifth more runs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So luck has affected every career of a test cricketer, and in some ways Phillip Hughes was lucky. He got a break at a young age and bucked the trend of players that struggle if they debut overseas, because he made his debut in a test series against South Africa, in Johannesburg in 2009. It was his second test match against South Africa, in Durban, for which he will be remembered. He scored 115 runs in the first innings and 160 in the second to clinch the three-match series for Australia. Phillip Hughes's centuries made him part of one of the most exclusive clubs in cricket history. In 137 years of cricket test history, only 63 players have scored centuries in both innings of a test match. His achievement was even more remarkable for the fact that Hughes was only 20 years old at the time, the youngest man to achieve the feat in cricket test history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His career was not perfect; few are. His technique was unorthodox and he had been in and out of the Australian team. By the time of his death, he was fighting to regain a spot in our test team. But his performances were remarkable. He was one of only four Australians to have scored multiple centuries by their 21st birthday. The other three were Neil Harvey, Doug Walters and Don Bradman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When young people die, we cannot help but think of the promise unfulfilled. This is the second condolence speech I have given this year in this place on a young man, full of potential, dying shy of his 26th birthday. Who knows what heights Phillip Hughes could have reached had his career not been cut tragically short—how many more runs to score, victories to savour and fans to delight?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Phillip Hughes's family—his mother, Virginia, father, Greg, sister, Megan, and brother, Jason—it will not be his unfulfilled professional potential that they will miss but the presence of a cherished member of their family. There is no meaning to be found in death like this. It was a tragic accident. But we can take comfort from the way it has brought us together as a community—the heartfelt tributes by cricket and sporting fans across the world, including here in our cricketing community in Canberra, and the bats left out across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the under-13 game on Saturday between Canberra Grammar and Daramalan College, Grammar batsmen Felix Ford and Oliver Phillips both retired on 63 not out—Phillip Hughes's final score. Felix's mum, Simonetta Astolfi, said: 'The players were talking about it a lot. The mood was pretty sombre. But by the end of the of the day, the kids were energised and playing for a purpose.' That ambivalence that Simonetta Astolfi speaks about will be familiar to cricket fans around the country as we look forward to a summer of cricket—forever tainted by the tragedy of Phillip Hughes's death. Cricket is a great Australian pastime and Phillip Hughes was a highly skilled, enthusiastic and joyful cricketer. We will fondly remember his triumphs and rue the innings he will never get to play. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.</span>

                  <a href="208884" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PORTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  I rise to make a short contribution to this debate about the death of Phillip Hughes. I do so as a member of parliament representing my 100,000-odd constituents but also as a proud board member of the Western Australian Cricket Association and as a person who has had a lifelong love of the game, inherited from my grandfather and fostered obsessively by my mother. Last Friday after returning from Canberra, watching my wife digging through a grey nicks bag—for an old bat to place next to a tattered Greg Chappell wide brim hat at the front of our house in tribute to the loss of a fine young cricketer—was a deeply sombre experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even when middle age reduces playing to the odd social game, the opening of a cricket bag on any other occasion is just a simple joy. The cricket bag is one of those needle-hooks of experience that drags the mind back to wonderful things. The smell of zinc stained whites, usually unwashed from the last rare match, ignites the summer corner of the brain. The mere sight of the strange artefacts in a cricket bag revives a collage of memories that are better than the best of dreams. The cricket bag is the treasure-trove of youth, of summer, of friends and of the pursuit of simple and beautiful things. Cricket is the greatest game on earth. Everything good about sport and life is to be found somewhere inside cricket. So the opening of a cricket bag in mourning, rather than joy, was something that hundreds of thousands of Australians would have done for the first time in their lives last week. Opening a cricket bag in sadness rather than joy is something that none of us would ever have thought we would do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil Hughes, by every single account, was just one of those guys, one of the few who embody all the best things about the pursuit of a great game at the very heart of Australian life. Cricket is not a skill that just happens; it is a craft that only a handful of completely brilliant people can master over decades. Even then it is only mastered if they are willing to offer the sport itself their complete and utter dedication. Sometimes the sporting personalities who can combine natural talent with the single-mindedness the game requires can be as difficult as they are admirable, but the picture that emerges of Phil Hughes is very clear and very simple—that he was one of those diamonds of the game, a combination of amazing athletic skill and personal discipline wedded together to produce a rare optimism and a redoubtable person. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In losing someone like this, Australia is confronting one of those singular events that forces us to withdraw briefly from the busy swim of our lives and sit just for a while on the bank. I recall the biography of the greatest ever Scottish sportsman, the heroic Eric Liddell. In that biography, the author in the preface felt compelled to make the point that, after the endless interviews and research for the biography, they were astounded by the simple fact that not a single person in the hundreds that they had interviewed had a single bad thing to say about the great runner. The same can clearly be said of Phillip Hughes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be so good at something so great, to have so loved his cricket, and at the same time to be the best of teammates, of friends and of people, is the rarest of things. To lose the best of us doing something we all love as much as he did is why our mourning is so profound. To Phillip's family, I extend today every conceivable sympathy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  It is with great sadness that I rise to speak in this condolence debate and add my words to the other members of parliament who have spoken so eloquently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the week that Phillip Hughes, tragically, passed away there were many other tragedies around the country. We had the death of truck drivers, we had youth suicides, we had deaths by industrial accident, we had fatal car crashes and we had people die unexpectedly of heart attacks and strokes. All and each of those were a tragedy in their own right and a tragedy for their family, friends and loved ones. But the death of Phillip Hughes has struck a chord in the nation that I do not think I have ever seen before. We have seen such an outpouring of grief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PutOutYourBats campaign saw perhaps 100,000 Australians around the country actually putting a cricket bat out at the front of their house. We saw a cricket bat stuck up outside Kirribilli House. On Sunday night when I came into parliament to drop my things off, the member for Barker, whose office is a few doors up from mine, had his bat there. I brought my own in and, with the member for Barker, we put those bats down in front of the House of Representatives chamber as a small tribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the question: why has there been such an outpouring of grief over Phillip Hughes' deaths? I think there are a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is because of what cricket actually means to our nation. There is something about the game of cricket that gets into our blood as Australians and as young people. Maybe it is the nobility of the game, but there is something special that the game has. It is something that we can talk about amongst friends and colleagues. And, of course, there is the traditional Christmas Day-Boxing Day test match. There is just something about the game that is unique to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I think the reason it struck so many people is that we were all once Phillip Hughes. We were all once those kids from the country or kids from suburban parts of our cities playing backyard cricket with dreams of one day wearing the baggy green and trying to replicate our idols. When we will bowling, we were Dennis Lillee; when we were batting, we were Ian Chappell. We were all once those kids playing in our backyards. We all played backyard cricket, where we developed the rules to our backyard game like English law—in the way that the English common law has been developed, we debated what constitutes a four, what was a six or, if you hit a particular house, how much that was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we read through the tributes to Phillip Hughes this is exactly what he did with his family. In fact, his history said that Phillip Hughes was known for his strength through the offside through those slashing square cuts and those slashing cover drives. It said that those actually came about because where he played outside his family home on the leg side is actually because of where his family home was. He was frightened to hit a shot to the leg side too hard as it would hit his mother's kitchen window and perhaps he would be in trouble—and so therefore he became an offside player!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the other reason that this has caused such an outpouring of grief is because of what Phillip Hughes actually achieved in his too-short career. I will just go through some of the records. At age 17, while still in high school, he made a century on debut in Sydney grade cricket. At age 18 he became one of the youngest players ever to debut for New South Wales. In that year he averaged 62 and he became the youngest player ever to score a century in a Sheffield Shield final. At the age of 20 he was selected to open the batting for Australia against South Africa. We can all remember that most ugly four-ball test duck that he faced when he was taking on the might of the South African pace attack of Dale Steyn and Morkel at the time. But in his second test he became the youngest cricketer ever to score a century in both innings. He was the first Australian batsmen to score a one-day century on debut and was the first Australian batsman to score 202 in a recent one-day match up in Darwin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is well known that many Australian batsmen have all sorts of trouble playing in English conditions. Phillip Hughes first went to England to play for Middlesex and he scored three centuries in his first three innings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But perhaps his greatest performance was his Sheffield Shield game playing for New South Wales against Tasmania at Bellerive Oval. Often the true indication of a genius or someone with great skills is how they perform compared to everyone else. For many years a record was held by Don Bradman from the 1939-1940 season when he scored the greatest percentage of runs in a Sheffield Shield game. Phillip Hughes broke that record in the 2008-2009 season when in one match he scored 58 per cent of New South Wales runs. If you have a look through the scorecard, it is truly amazing to see how talented he was. On a green wicket at Bellerive Oval down in Hobart, New South Wales batted first and scored 172. Phil Hughes scored 93 of those 172 runs. Towards the end of the day's play, after Tasmania had gone into bat, 17 wickets had already fallen with but an hour to go; Tasmania was seven for 41. So 17 wickets had fallen for only 213 runs, and Phillip Hughes had scored 93 of those runs. That in itself would be a truly remarkable effort, but, after Tasmania were finally rolled for 127, in the second innings Phil Hughes repeated the same thing. Out of a total of 173 for New South Wales, Phillip Hughes scored 108 runs. That performance was the highest percentage of runs ever scored by an Australian batsman in a Sheffield Shield game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reason there has been such an outpouring of grief is for what Phillip Hughes could have achieved. He died, was taken away from us all, at the age of just 25. If you look at some of our greatest test players, many of them did not achieve their best efforts until they were 26, 27, 28 or into their early 30s. Look at a player like Adam Gilchrist, who did not get selected for Australia until he was almost 27 years of age. But I think there has been such an outpouring because Phillip Hughes's death reminds us of the fragility of life—that, for any of us, our lives can be taken away in a split second. Rather than going along with the sometimes petty gossiping and bickering, and worrying about petty issues, we should live life as Phillip Hughes batted and seize the day: make every day count.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cricket is a game of numbers and statistics. Every child knows that Don Bradman's average was 99.94. I think for many years or forever, as long as cricket is played, the number 63 will be remembered as the score that Phillip Hughes was not out on. Finally I would like to add a message to Sean Abbott. Mate, the best thing that Phillip Hughes would want you to do is to charge in off your long run, bend your back and dig the ball in. Vale, Phillip Hughes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I rise to speak in this debate about Phillip Hughes and commend the remarks of the member for Hughes, which I have just listened to. His words speak to many of the feelings that I have about this event, which has, as the member for Hughes said, unleashed an extraordinary outpouring of emotion across the country—which is genuinely remarkable and which has grown since the moment we heard this terrible news. It is emotion which has poured out not just across the country but around the cricketing world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does beg the question: what is it about? Over and above the obvious tragedy of what we have seen, this has touched a chord in the life of Australia. It is worth thinking about why this has become such a profound moment. Part of it obviously has to do with the sudden, inexplicable tragedy of a moment in time which utterly changes our world and brings somebody's life to an immediate end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the idea that, just two weeks ago, Phillip Hughes walked on this earth and was breathing and living in precisely the kind of normal, day-to-day way that each of us here is. And now we are speaking in this debate in this parliament today. It is unimaginable. With that moment of shock, so many lives around Phillip Hughes's life are changed in a way which will be permanent. There is something appalling about the fragility of life that that moment demonstrates. Of course, that moment in different ways is played out, sadly, almost every day within our community, but this was a very visible moment that we all got to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of it, then, is that this has happened not to just anybody but to a really famous, highly skilled person—one of the 20 or 30 best cricketers on the planet, a person whose fortunes we have followed over the last few years. Sometimes I think we have a sense that those in the public eye are immune from the fragilities of daily life, but this tragedy is a reminder that they are not and that a person of his skill, of his standing, of his extraordinary flair and of his individuality and the way that he was able to bring that to his sport can be the subject of such a random, sad and devastating event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of it also, I think, is this idea of distilled talent unrealised. Phillip Hughes really was at the beginning of his career; the best of it was yet to come. He was 25 and, as the member for Hughes said, in cricketing terms his best years were ahead of him. Indeed, many players do not make a debut in test cricket until after that age. It has surprised all of us who are cricket fans, in a way, that Phillip Hughes was still so young, because he burst onto the scene playing his first test for Australia as a 19-year-old and he was genuinely a prodigy. He had talent in bundles in a way which is hard to imagine. The idea that we will not get to see that played out in all its glory seems profoundly sad. We have been deprived of so much joy that we were all awaiting. As a sports fan across a number of sports but particularly with a love of cricket, there is an excitement about watching a career begin and explode, and there is a certain anticipation of what is going to occur. Of course, all of that has been denied.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are parallels to Archie Jackson, who played eight tests for Australia in the twenties and thirties. He was a contemporary of Bradman's. He was also from New South Wales and, at the age of 19, he debuted for Australia, making 164 in his first test match. At the time, he was the youngest person ever to score a test century. When he and Bradman went to England on the 1930 tour, it was regarded, actually, that Archie Jackson might have been the better of the two players, though that may not have played out, given the extraordinary nature of Bradman. Archie Jackson contracted tuberculosis and died at the age of 23, having only played eight test matches. When you read the histories of that Bradman era and the histories of cricket through the thirties—it was an important game, almost more important then in our nation's psyche than it is now—you really get the sense that something was tragically lost in the inability for us to see the full glory of Archie Jackson's career. So it is with Phillip Hughes. The circumstances of his death were obviously different, but the idea that we will not get to see his full development is absolutely the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of it is Australia's love of cricket. This is a fantastic game, a game that is full of stats and full of different stories. It is a game that is absolutely about exquisite skill and ability but has an enormous mental element to it. We see people without ability who make it and people with ability who do not. Grittiness plays a part in it as well. It has been utterly central to our nation's history. When Bradman was carving the English to bits during the 1930s, there was a sense in which that, as much as anything, was Australia striking out with its independence from another country. It was a time when Australia's status as an independent nation was ambiguous. Some have described it as almost akin, in a way, to our war of independence, as Bradman took apart the English. When the Prime Minister of India was here recently, there was a quote about the first Prime Minister of India, Nehru, and about the way in which Bradman dealt with the English at that time. It was more than cricket. It was absolutely about the beginning of the identity of our country and, to this day, Bradman is probably the single most unifying person in our nation's history—and he is a cricketer.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sport which is deeply imbued in our psyche, as it is in the psyche of so many around the world, but this is, deeply, an Australian game. I was looking at quotes about cricket and, back in the 70s, John Arlott and Freddie Trueman made this remark: that most games are skin-deep, but cricket goes to the bone. I think that is absolutely the way we as Australians regard this game. That this game can have thrown up such a tragedy as the one we witnessed last week with Phillip Hughes is also, I think, part of why there is this outpouring of emotion—part of why so many of us who love cricket feel compelled at the moment to have a bat outside our door.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But ultimately, this is actually more than cricket. Michael Clarke's testimony about Phillip Hughes made the point that Phillip Hughes's cricketing ability was secondary to who he was as person. When you read what those who knew him have written about Phillip Hughes, you get the sense that he was first and foremost a person of enormous humility. When somebody has been given a great gift—an enormous gift—and can deal with it in a humble way, there is something really special about that. There is something that attracts all of us to it. So often, we see that with great gifts comes a difficulty in handling them, and sometimes a conceit—but none of that appears to have been a feature at all of Phillip Hughes; indeed, the defining characteristic that you hear spoken about him was his humility—this humble kid from country New South Wales, bequeathed with an extraordinary gift. I think that that is actually why there is such an outpouring of grief: because it feels profoundly unfair that this person—of all people—who dealt with his gift in such a graceful and humble way, should have been deprived of it, along with his life, in this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I too would like to finish with a thought for Sean Abbott. I cannot imagine what Sean Abbott is thinking about. This is deeply unfair to him. He did not do anything wrong. There was not even a sense of negligence. It was just a random event. And I really hope that he is able to return to the game that he loves, and that he is able to continue it in the future. Vale, Phillip Hughes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I too rise to speak in this important debate on the death of Phillip Hughes. From Marrickville to Mumbai, from Lords to the Sydney Cricket Ground, people all over the world have paid tribute to Phillip Hughes since his tragic passing. The pain of losing a son, a brother, a friend, and a talented cricket player has touched more than just cricket fans; it has reached across Australia and across the world. In winter, we are divided as a nation by four football codes. In summer, we are united by our love of one truly national game—and that is cricket. It is the backdrop to our childhood summers: the sound of backyard cricket, the test on the TV over Boxing Day, the scents of barbecues—it is quintessentially about who we are and how we have grown up. So Phillip Hughes is one of us but he is also about all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister may be the highest office in the land but no status is more revered than to be chosen to play test cricket for Australia. To be given that honour and then to fight repeatedly to win it back says something about the character of Hughes, and the way he went about that earned him the love and the respect of all who follow our game. His passing has prompted an unprecedented outpouring of grief and extraordinary tributes. Bats at a gentle lean in the shade of verandas around the nation, from humble backyards to the gates of Kirribilli House, and here in the corridors of Parliament House and even at Lord's is a simple but magnificent way for all of us to share in the grief caused by the loss of a young man who played the game his own way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At cricket grounds around the nation, 63-second silences were held in honour of Hughes' final score, and players retired their bat at 63. In my own electorate there was a magnificent gesture from the captain of the Haddon Cricket Club, Shaun Macarthur. With a score of 408 at the end of the 63rd over against VRI Delacombe, Shaun declared their innings closed, ensuring the scoreboard became a memorial to Phillip Hughes, with his baggy green No. 408 united with that final innings of 63. Despite Haddon's all-time batting record being within reach, Shaun chose to walk from the pitch to remember Hughes. It was a fine gesture and one that many across the nation have replicated with '63 not out' becoming a catchcry for many young cricketers. I want to thank Shaun and the many clubs in my own community and across the nation for providing such fine tributes to such a fine young man. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with other contributors, I too want to finish my remarks by saying that our hearts go out Sean Abbott—a young man who I hope very much feels and understands the love and support that is coming not just from this parliament but from the entire Australian community. We are proud of this young man. We think that he has suffered an unimaginable experience that will obviously be with him for his whole life. All of us send him our support and our care and wish him all the best over this summer of cricket. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I also rise to associate myself with the Prime Minister's condolence remarks on the tragic loss of Phillip Hughes. Today as we mourn the loss of one of Australia's finest sporting talents, we also pay tribute to his life. Phillip Hughes was a humble and decent man from Macksville in northern New South Wales. He was raised on his parents' banana farm and always stayed true to his country roots. From a very young age it was clearly apparent that Phillip had a prodigious talent for cricket. At nine years old, he was playing representative cricket for the north coast and by 12 was already playing A-grade cricket. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip's dream of playing cricket for a living did not come without its sacrifices. At 17, he left his family and friends in northern New South Wales and moved to Sydney to play professionally. However, Phillip did not have to wait long to get his chance to play for his new team. On 20 November 2007, at 18, he made his first-class debut with the Blues against Tasmania at the SCG, becoming the state's youngest debutant since Michael Clarke. Three months later in February 2008, Phillip went on to become the youngest player ever to score a century in a Sheffield Shield final, subsequently winning the New South Wales Rising Star Award. The following year, in 2009, while on his debut tour with the Australian Cricket Team in South Africa, Phillip scored back-to-back centuries against the Proteas in Durban. Phillip was 20 years old, the youngest ever player in test cricket to score two centuries. This historic achievement helped Australia to a surprise series victory and, in doing so, the boy from Macksville had grabbed the world's attention. Unfortunately, Phillip was bowled out by England in 2010-11 Ashes, for which he lost his place in the national side. In the ensuing years, he was constantly in and out of the test team but he refused to give up, proving that he had both the patience and the mental fortitude to play at the highest level. Phillip bided his time, listened to advice and worked hard on aspects of his game that needed improvement. Yet, last week, just as selectors looked set to finally give Phillip another call-up for his country, his life was cut tragically short in a freak accident at the SCG. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we struggle to come to terms with this terrible loss, I am reminded of the Prime Minister<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s comments that this was a young man living out his dream. He was doing what he loved until his final breath, and for that we should be truly grateful. The energy and spirit he showed both on and off the field throughout his life should be an example to us all. At just 25, Phillip had already set the cricketing world alight with his precious and daring talent. Everyone who knew him speaks of a man who would go out of his way to help others and who always had a positive attitude no matter what was a thrown at him, and he never gave up on his dream. Phillip Hughes is a lesson to us all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincerest condolences to Phillip's friends and family as they pay their final respects today. The Macarthur cricket community, along with the rest of the country, mourn your loss. You remain in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time. I would also like to say to Sean Abbott that each and every one of us pray that you do not in any way hold yourself responsible for what happened last week. I look forward to seeing you back on the field, as Phillip would have wished. Phillip Hughes, you will always remain 63 not out. You will be sadly missed but forever remembered. May you rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I rise on behalf of my constituents to express our condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Phillip Hughes, following his passing last Thursday after the awful accident at the SCG on Tuesday. It is an understatement to say the death of Phillip Hughes has affected many millions of Australians very deeply. We have been sincerely shocked that a young man in his prime could die as a result of playing the gentlemen's sport of cricket, a game that is integral to our national sporting culture. We shook our heads at the unexpected and freak nature of this accident. We felt for Phillip's family. We sympathised with his friends and colleagues. We scoured the press for those two days, looking for a glimmer of hope that there would be some good news. And we were so saddened by this tragedy and its impact on everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday, at cricket ovals all over the nation, tributes were paid, minutes of silence were held and remembrance was given for a wonderful sportsman. Others have reflected on his prowess at the game he loved, and his name and scores will be etched in the history books forever. Quite rightly, we have celebrated the skills that enabled him to play at elite level and represent our nation internationally. But what has really struck me, and I think has heightened our national grief, is that Phillip Hughes was not just a great sportsman. As his friends have each attested, he was genuinely a decent human being who set an example for others in the way he lived his life. If there can be any consolation for his family and his friends, it is this. Phillip's life will have an impact for generations to come. The ripple effect will be hard to qualify, but it will enrich our nation for so many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It can sometimes feel like there is a lack of genuine role models for our young people, but I know there are many young people—boys and young men, in particular—all around this country who have vowed to honour Phillip Hughes in deed and action. I know there are parents all around this nation who have had discussions with their children about life and the importance of the values that Phillip Hughes embodied. They have told tearful children, as they have tucked them up at night, that the best way to honour someone is to live your life in the best way possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mother of three girls, I admit I perhaps do not have a personal knowledge of how much cricket can mean to boys and young men. However, one of my staff has an 11-year-old son who plays for his local club and she assures me that the passion and fervour her son reserves for cricket are very special. I am sure there are many mums of boys around our country who know exactly what I am talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport has an enormous role in teaching our young people values like responsibility, determination, teamwork, striving to do better, mateship and, importantly, how to deal with loss. Most of the time, it is dealing with the loss of a game. For the cricketing world last week, it was dealing with the loss of a young man who was a friend to all who knew him and a role model for many others. While it has been a difficult time for many people, including many who did not know Phillip personally but have been touched by this random accident, it is also a reminder to every one of us to be a little kinder, to hold those we love a little closer and to remember that every minute we have on this earth is precious. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely hope that the outpouring of emotion provides some consolation to the Hughes family. I hope they hold to the thought that this tragic accident has touched the hearts of many and will act as a catalyst to remind them of what is important in life and how they should conduct themselves. There are undoubtedly many who, until last week, have only admired Phillip's cricketing prowess and now, having read a little more about the type of man he was and the way he treated others, will seek to emulate the person he was, not just the skills he possessed. I sincerely hope the knowledge of this aspect of Phillip's legacy provides his parents, Greg and Virginia; his sister, Megan; and his brother, Jason, with a degree of solace at this incredibly difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is richer for the life of Phillip Hughes. On behalf of the people of McPherson, I extend my condolences to his family and friends.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I want to join with Australians from all walks of life in recording my sadness and also, I think, to speak for the whole of the Flinders electorate at their sadness at the loss of a beautiful young man, a wonderful young life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember watching Phillip Hughes's maiden test century. I was actually in Western Australia at the time. I was at home of Peter van Onselen, and we were meeting for the first time. We were talking about life and we had the cricket on in the background. We stopped and we watched this amazing left-handed genius, in his second test, approach the century and achieve it in the most glorious of fashions. Both of us thought here was somebody who was the one to continue in the tradition of Greg Chappell, passed on to Allan Border, passed down the line to Steve Waugh and then to Ricky Ponting and to Michael Clarke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the omens were that this young man—who, at age 20, then went on to achieve the extraordinary outcome of being the youngest person ever to have compiled two centuries in the same test match—had a glorious career ahead of him. I subsequently made the statement publicly that I thought that he would play 100 tests. Far more importantly than my view, the Australian captain, Michael Clarke, has said over recent days that he believes this young man, who was almost 26 at the time of his passing, had his best years ahead of him. He had already made some extraordinary achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think the reason that the loss of Phillip Hughes has gripped Australia so much is that, firstly, it was so public—on the pitch, in front of four current test players—with not a ripple but a tidal wave through the entire Australian team and cricketing community. Secondly, it was clear that his best years were ahead of him, despite what he had already achieved, and that he was right on the edge of potentially returning as the No. 3 batsman within the Australian cricket team. Indeed, if this innings had progressed from 63 not out to a century, I would say he was odds-on. Having said that, there is this grieving at the sense of loss. Thirdly, what has emerged is that the person behind the impish grin and the cheeky smile was one of the most fundamentally decent nationally ranked sportspeople of recent decades. There was a sense of being unaffected by the international stage and a sense of the love of the bush from which he came with his family—with Greg and Virginia, his parents, and Megan and Jason, his sister and brother respectively.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that we have the classic Australian story of bush to the bright lights, but without affectation—without a loss of the sheer joy of the game, the love of the bush and the intense love of family and friends—is the most extraordinary testament to Phillip Hughes's family, his teammates and his own character. These things together—the public nature of the demise, the sense of loss for what could have been and, above all else, the respect for somebody who was just a decent human being of the highest order—seem to have captured the nation, and, I think, rightly so. Every now and then, there is a moment where tragedy strikes and it represents a collective reckoning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great game. I have lived and breathed cricket myself since I was a very young boy. My first real memory of the game is of watching Doug Walters reach his century in Perth with a six—a great reminiscence of that. In the same way, it was reflected with Phil Hughes achieving his first test century. Throughout that time it has been the national sport, but this is the most high profile and profoundly moving death of a leading Australian cricketer since Archie Jackson, back in 1930.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would simply say this: we are deeply saddened. I think the 'put out the bat' spontaneous movement has been a very uplifting element of Australia responding to this sadness, saying, 'We just think this is a tragedy.' I have seen houses and I have seen shops and I have seen the front doors of parliament with bats and a hat out the front. That is the best of Australia coming to recognise the best of a young man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing, for Philip Hughes's family, will replace this young man, but I am certain that, as they have generously said, young Australian cricketers should feel blessed to bat on, to bowl on, to field on, to be part of the game, because it is as clear as night follows day that such an unaffected young man would not want his tragedy to impair people's love for the game. But, at the same time, I feel that this tragedy will also be remembered and will put the game in perspective, in that, at the end of the day, it is humanity and people and mateship and family which matter more than anything else. For that, I say that he should be congratulated on a life well lived. His memory should be honoured, and his family should be comforted.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I know that the member for Riverina also wants to speak in this debate, so I will endeavour to be brief. It is with great sadness that I speak this afternoon on the death of Phillip Hughes. I think all of us who love cricket and who have played cricket have been absolutely shocked by what has happened, and also I think the Australian community have been reminded of how fragile life can be. I cannot forget seeing for the first time the footage of the blow that struck Phillip Hughes. Can I say to the young man who bowled that ball: you hold no responsibility whatsoever for what has happened here, and a nation feels for the pain that you must be feeling at the moment, as the nation feels for the pain that Phillip Hughes's family and friends must be feeling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all—or a lot of us have—faced a cricket ball bowled at us which has whizzed past our ears, and we have ducked and we have weaved. We have also been hit by cricket balls. But none of us, I think, have ever thought that, in a split second, that could bring an end to our lives. I think that is the thing that has so starkly hit us all with what happened to Phillip Hughes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the events have unfolded, we have heard more and more about what an incredible young man Phillip Hughes was. I must say that, as a country boy and a very proud country boy, I have loved hearing about how he epitomised what coming from the country meant. The spirit with which he went about things and the approach he had to life reminded me that you can never take the country out of people who are born and bred there, who grow up there and who have those values instilled in them. Everything about Phillip Hughes seems to epitomise that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that most epitomised that was his ability to deal with the adversity that was thrown at him. He had a brilliant start to his test career. I remember watching it at night when he made his first test hundred over in South Africa. The approach that he took was brilliant to watch. He flayed the South Africans, especially through the off side, using that wonderful cut shot that he had. It was fantastic. But then, of course, with his technique, fast bowlers thought that they saw some opportunities and he was out of the test team. Did he drop his bat, did he say, 'This is too all hard, I am going to give up'? No—he just worked and worked and got himself back into the test team. He also focused on his one-day career. Then he had adversity again. He was dropped again. What did he do? All he did was say, 'I am going to work even harder and harder.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that tomorrow, in what would have been the first test starting in Brisbane, we would have seen Phillip Hughes walking out to bat again for his nation. Without doubt he was about to embark on a wonderful career as a test batsman for this nation. He had learned. He had continued to hone his techniques. He had continued to develop the skills that he needed. In much the same way that Matthew Hayden took a while to get into the test team and had to learn to play with softer hands, Phillip Hughes learned that he had to come to terms with his technique. I think he had, and he was ready to embark on a fantastic career. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with great sadness that I speak on this matter today. The tributes that have been paid by the parliament have been absolutely magnificent. The tweet 'put out your bats' has been incredible. I know I did it myself. I know the member for Riverina also did it. It is extraordinary what that tribute really meant. May Phillip rest in peace. I extend my kindest regards to his family and friends following this absolutely tragic event.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  Vale Phillip Hughes on behalf of the people in the Riverina, not just the cricketing community but all people in the Riverina who have shared the emotional roller-coaster that this nation has been plunged onto in recent days with the tragic death of a great young Australian. As the member for Wannon said, he was a great young country Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Phillip Hughes story was quintessentially Australian. He was a boy from Macksville who made good but who never forgot his roots, who never forgot where he came from and who never forgot his origins. When he was playing test cricket and one-day cricket for Australia he yearned so often to be back on his father's banana farm or chasing the cattle around and doing all those things that country boys love to do. He is sadly missed by all, not just those who follow sport and who follow cricket. As I say, this has put the country into a state of mourning like we have not seen previously with the death of a sportsman. Paul Taylor's wonderful 'put out your bats' social media campaign has captivated not just people in Australia but people right across the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all love our sport but we should not forget that sport is dangerous. Whilst we mourn the death of Phillip Hughes at the all-too-young age of 25, we should not forget the four female jockeys—Simone Montgomerie, 26; Desiree Gill, 45; Carly-Mae Pye, 26; and Caitlin Forrest, just 19—and the female hockey player, Lizzie Watkins, 24, who have all died since 2012, playing sport. Whilst they all loved doing so, it does bring home the fragility of life. Sport does unite us in a way that nothing else can, and certainly I have seen some wonderful contributions to that effect from this parliament, generally a divided parliament. Indeed, we are all united on this occasion, as we should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a time of sadness in the Riverina. Yesterday I attended the funeral of Mark Andrew Cornell, a great mate of mine, a good cricketer, who passed away on 26 November from pancreatic cancer. He fought the good fight against the illness for nine years. His sister-in-law, Colleen Breust, said that one of his great loves, as well as playing Australian Rules for Ungarie, was playing cricket, and his fondest moment was when he and his two brothers-in-law, Chris and Pete, played with him against West Wyalong: they won the grand final as underdogs, in the final overs. The loss of Phil Hughes was not forgotten by those at the funeral yesterday in Wagga Wagga as we celebrated the life of Mark, gone all too soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mourn Phillip Hughes; we mourn the four female jockeys and the hockey player I mentioned earlier; and we mourn Mark Cornell, all of whom are gone way before their time. But they leave an indelible mark on us all. I finish with a statement by Sachin Tendulkar, who said, long before Phillip Hughes died:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I feel when somebody has been playing cricket for a long time, he creates a separate identity for himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Phillip Hughes did not play cricket for a long time, he scored a century, as the member for Wannon pointed out, in just his second test, just like Sir Donald Bradman, and then backed it up with another one in the next innings—the very youngest batsman to ever do that in test cricket history. Phil Hughes did not play cricket for a long time; it was all too short. But he certainly created a separate identity for himself, not just because he has died but because of what he gave to the game and the legacy that he leaves behind.</span>
