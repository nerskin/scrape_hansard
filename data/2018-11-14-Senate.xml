                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I have a statement regarding a point of order raised by Senator Bernardi yesterday with respect to badges. Holding up newspapers or placards or displaying items such as badges with slogans is disorderly and was ruled as such by President Sibraa and President Reid on numerous occasions. It is also very well established by rulings of past presidents, including President Calvert in 2003, that it is not in order to wear in the chamber T-shirts or other clothing bearing slogans. President Parry ruled it is disorderly for senators to wear garments bearing slogans, regardless of the size of the slogan, on 17 July 2014. Such practices are disruptive of orderly debate as they allow senators to intervene in ways other than by receiving the call from the chair. It would be highly undesirable to have debate in the Senate reduced to the level of displaying such material. The Senate is not a billboard. I believe it is consistent to apply this same principle to attachments to items of clothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with statements I have made over the past year, I distinguish from these rules the wearing of relatively non-contentious lapel-sized ribbons and badges without statements or slogans, a practice which has grown to be accepted over many years now. I understand that senators have strong views on many issues, but debate in the Senate is subject to simple and reasonable rules to maintain order. Senators will be called to order in accordance with these rules. I thank senators.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  In my last remaining minutes, I'll go back and summarise my speech from last night. I started my speech talking about the adventures of Bunyip Bluegum and the very famous Australian literary classic <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Pudding</span>. I talked about the allure and seduction of the magic pudding: how Bunyip Bluegum couldn't go past a pudding that needed constant eating. It was a cheeky, mischievous pudding that invited everyone to consume it constantly. I talked about how the adventure led to pudding thieves and a chase across the Australian bush trying to keep the pudding away from pudding thieves, and how this reflected the GST debate in this country in recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say again that the Greens will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018, but we want to be very clear that this GST legislation that we have before us is like a magic puddingâmiraculously, more money is going to solve the problem and keep the pudding growing. The money to keep the pudding constantly replenished has to come from somewhere. We know this Liberal government has an atrocious track record of taking money from Australia's most vulnerable people. We just saw this week a 25 per cent cut to Foodbank announced by a Liberal minister. Luckily, our Prime Minister intervened after three days of public debate, including the National Farmers Federation wading into this debate. They're prepared to cut aid for fresh food to Australians, even at a time of relative fiscal ease. Can you imagine what's going to happen in five or 10 years time when they need to top up the GST magic pudding and they don't have the money?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in 2013 zombie budget cuts to just about every aspect of our social security netâeven to GP co-paymentsâthe age of entitlement and ex-Treasurer Mr Joe Hockey smoking cigars with Senator Cormann, who's in the chamber today. I'll never forget that, and I don't think anyone in this chamber or the Australian public will ever forget that. There are two critical issues: where the money is going to come from and the fact that we need to maintain constant vigilance as to where in consolidated revenue those funds will come from. They have to come from somewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second pointâand Senator Dean Smith is in the chamber nowâis that I wholeheartedly agree that this should be the start of a much bigger debate about tax reform in this country and the role that the Commonwealth government plays in that. Like Senator Smith, I also agree that the Commonwealth government should play a bigger role in the taxation debate versus the states. I gave my views last night, and I'll give them again in conclusion. If we want to be talking about tax reform, let's talk about proper reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax. I note that the CEO of WoodsideâSenator Cormann and Senator Smith, being Western Australian senators, would be familiar with himâtalked about locking in the government's recent weak reforms to the PRRT. I'm not surprised that he wants to lock those in, because we need to go a lot further. We need to go a lot further than just changing the uplift rates on the PRRT. We need to actually put a 10 per cent floor on annual royalty from these projects that can be offset against future PRRT liabilities. The Greens will be announcing and releasing our costings on this shortly. We believe that is a much more equitable and fair way to roll out the PRRT into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also be releasing details, going into the next federal electionâwhich I understand will be very soonâon significant tax reform around new resource rent taxes, especially mining resource rent taxes, super profit taxes. They're the kinds of things we believe the Commonwealth government should be leading on. We do need tax reform in this country, I agree with Senator Smith. Why have we walked away from super profit taxes on the mining industry, for example? There are a number of other reforms we would like to see. We would like to see carbon pricing, another national reform that was enacted by this government, that the Commonwealth government led on. We need to have a price on carbon if we're going to tackle emissions. It's not a silver bullet, I agree, but it's an absolutely necessary component for action on reducing emissions, even if we're going to meet our Paris targets, which may not be enough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we need to have the debate in here about the role of the Commonwealth and the federal parliament in looking at a price on carbon. And there's so much more. I welcome the debate on tax reform at the federal government level. We will be supporting this. We are very cautious about where this money's going to come from. We will be vigilant, to make sure that it's not taken off Australia's most vulnerable people, by whichever party is in power in the next term of government or the term after that, when the GST magic pudding has to be topped up. We'll be watching very closely for who the pudding thieves are going to be. We have our suspicions right here, right now, who they are. The Greens will play a role in parliament in keeping a future government, be it Labor or Liberal, honest on tax reform and federal government tax reform in Australia.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  I rise to make a short contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. I want to make it clear at the outset that, like other Labor senators, I will be supporting this bill. The main reason, though, that I want to make a contribution is to highlight some very concerning remarks that were made in the debate on this bill by Pauline Hanson's One Nation senator from Western Australia, Senator Peter Georgiou. I was very disturbed yesterday when I heard Senator Georgiou's marks. We all know, in Queensland, that Senator Hanson and her party colleagues have a long history of saying they are prepared to sell out Queensland when it comes to GST funding. It would appear that, despite many rebuffs by the public and election defeats for Senator Hanson, she and her colleagues are still at it, trying to take GST funding off Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments Senator Georgiou made yesterday that I want to refer to include the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's time to get real. Instead of trying to keep everyone happy, the government should announce that the distribution of GST will move to a per capita basis over a five-year time frame â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What would it mean for GST to move to a per capita basis, whether it be over a five-year time frame or anything else? For starters, the Productivity Commission, the federal government's own body, had a good look at this earlier in the debate about GST funding. They calculated that moving to a per capita system of distributing GST funds among the states would result in a cut of $1.2 billion per annum to Queensland in GST funding. That's $1.2 billion less that Queensland would have to spend on hospitals, on schools, on roads and on all sorts of other public services that Queenslanders depend upon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been waiting for Senator Hanson, throughout this debate, to come in and contradict the remarks made by her colleague, Senator Georgiou, but as yet she has failed to appear. She has been conspicuously silent in this debate while her own colleague, Senator Georgiou, has been willing to get up and bash Queensland yet again over GST funding. From her silence on this matter, we can only interpret that she must agree with Senator Georgiou that Western Australia and other states should benefit in GST funding at the expense of Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My suspicion that Senator Hanson is supportive of this position from Senator Georgiou is backed up by previous remarks that she has made on GST funding. Senator Hanson has a long history of making comments that indicate she is prepared to reduce GST funding to Queensland to benefit other states. Who can forget the comments Senator Hanson made in January 2017, prior to the Western Australian state election, when she appeared in an interview on Perth radio station 6PR. She was asked: 'Will you, Senator Hanson, help us in Western Australia in this fight, and would you be willing to see the GST share of your home state, Queensland, reduced so that Western Australia can get a better deal?' </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the only time, though, that she's made these kinds of comments. On 22 June this year in Queensland's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier Mail</span>, Senator Hanson was quoted as saying that she would be willing to push for a fair and just share of the GST carve-up for WA even at the expense of Queensland. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a senator in this place, and you're making decisions on the floor of Parliament, you have to step outside your State as well, and you've got to look at what is fair and balanced â¦ I'm the leader of a national party. You've got to look at what is fair and just, right across, for all Australians. And I will still stand by that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She backed it up with further comments to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier Mail</span> on 4 July this year saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ many Queenslanders would be happy to lose a few cents in GST revenue to increase funds to states like Western Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well I'm sorry, Senator Hanson, but moving to the per capita system that you and your colleagues have supported consistently doesn't mean that Queensland loses a few cents; it means that Queensland loses $1.2 billion per year, money that could be spent on essential public services right around Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been very vocal in the time I've been here about Senator Hanson having repeatedly sold out battlers on a range of issues. She's voted to cut penalty rates; she's voted to cut pensions; she's voted to cut funding for schools, hospitals and apprenticeships. And it's no surprise she does that because we all know she votes with the government, with the Liberals, 90 per cent of the time. What these comments that continue to come out from One Nation senators show is that not only Senator Hanson and her colleagues are prepared to sell out battlers but they're actually prepared to sell out every single Queenslander. They're prepared to sell out every Queensland man, every Queensland woman, every Queensland boy and every Queensland girl. They're prepared to sell out every nurse in Queensland, every teacher in Queensland, every motorist in Queensland and every pensioner in Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson should know better than anyone that Queensland is Australia's most decentralised state. It is an extremely expensive state in which to provide services. It's not just about providing services in inner city Melbourne or inner city Sydney; you've got to provide services in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Cairns, the Torres Strait and western Queenslandâvery remote places that are expensive to service but that deserve high-quality services from their state and federal governments. And, in order to do that, they require a fair share of GST funding, not to lose $1.2 billion a year, which is what Senator Hanson continues to advocate for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This might well be Senator Hanson's greatest sellout yet. There's a long line of them, whether it be penalty rates being cut or whether it be supporting cuts to schools, hospital funding and pensions. But this oneâsupporting cuts to GST funding of $1.2 billion per year to Queenslandâmay well be Senator Hanson's greatest sellout yet. It's about as big a sellout as you can get in Queensland. I don't think it would even be a bigger sellout if 'The King' Wally Lewis actually put on a blue New South Wales jersey. That's how bad this is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She is turning her back on Queenslanders yet again. I, for one, am sick of hearing Senator Hanson say one thing when she's travelling around Queenslandâthat she's sticking up for battlers and that she's down here in Canberra fighting for Queenslandersâand seeing her every time she comes down here line up with the Liberals to vote for cuts to the things that battlers need right throughout Queensland. And here she and her colleagues are again calling for Queensland to lose $1.2 billion a year in GST funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important that Senator Hanson finally come out today and express her position on this bill. Does she support what her colleague is sayingâmoving towards a per capita system of distributing GSTâor is she actually prepared to do her job as a senator for Queensland and fight for the benefit of Queensland, fight for the extra $1.2 billion a year in GST funding that her colleague wants to take off Queenslanders? The time for hiding is over, Senator Hanson. Come and state what your position is. Do you support changes to the GST system which would rip off Queenslanders or not?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:49</span>):  Firstly, I thank all those senators who've contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Our government has long recognised that what has been happening with WA's share of the GST is unfair, not sustainable in a federation and has to be fixed. The proposition that, in a federation, stronger states should support other states so that all have the capacity to provide similar outcomes for their populations is a good and important principle which we must continue to protect and preserve. However, an arrangement which puts any one state into the position, as has happened to WA in the past, where it receives less than 30 per cent of its share of the GST back as a result of fiscal equalisation cannot possibly be sustained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of Western Australia's federal Liberal members and senators have long argued that this is an unacceptable situation for our home state and must be fixed. Firstly, we secured about $1.4 billion in federal GST top-up payments for WA to provide additional funding towards much-needed WA infrastructure. This was always intended as a short-term measure. Initially in 2015-16 it effectively stopped the drop in WA's share of the GST from 37.6 per cent to below 30 per cent. For this financial yearâthe 2018-19 financial yearâour top-up payments have effectively lifted WA's share of the GST to 50 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To facilitate a more structured, ongoing resolution to this issue, WA Liberal members and senators advocated for and secured the Productivity Commission inquiry into the impact of GST-sharing arrangements on national productivity and growth. That was the basis on which, as a government, we focused on the national interest. We developed our plan to make GST arrangements fairer for WA and better for national economic growth and job creation, while also making sure that every state is better off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reforms GST payments to the states and territories by providing a fairer and more sustainable way of distributing the GST. It is a plan which addresses a longstanding unfairness for Western Australia in a way that leaves all states and territories better off. Since it was introduced in 2000, every dollar of GST raised has been distributed to the states and territories according to the system of horizontal fiscal equalisation. While this worked in a relatively predictable way in the early years of the horizontal fiscal equalisation system, the mining investment boom demonstrated that Australia's horizontal fiscal equalisation system struggles to function well when faced with economic shocks. In particular, the mining investment and construction boom created significant volatility in the distribution of the GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's plan will firstly create a new equalisation benchmarkâthe stronger of New South Wales or Victoria, whichever is higher. Secondly, it will introduce a permanent in-system relativity floor of 0.7 from 2022-23, increasing to 0.75 from 2024-25. Thirdly, it will permanently boost the GST pool of funds available for distribution to the states and territories by providing direct Commonwealth cash injections each year from 2021-22 onwards. These are in addition to GST collections. Fourthly, during the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27, states and territories will be guaranteed the better of the old system or the new system. Fifthly, by 2026 the Productivity Commission will conduct an inquiry to assess whether the updated system is working efficiently and effectively and operating as intended. Sixthly, it will separately provide short-term top-ups to Western Australia and the Northern Territory to keep their relativities above 0.7 and 4.66 respectively from 2019-20 to 2021-22.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this legislation, all states will be better off, with the Australian government injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29. The GST pool from 2026-27 will grow by more than a billion dollars each and every year compared with what would have occurred without these reforms. We have provided a national solution to a national challenge that was in the too-hard basket for too long. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:55</span>):  When the My Health Record controversy erupted four months ago, the government's first instinct was to bury its head in the sand and pretend there was no problem. It dismissed not just Labor's concerns but the concerns of senior respected medicos of the major medical groups, of domestic violence groups, of privacy, security and legal experts and of the union movement. It also dismissed the concerns of ordinary Australians worried about the security of their most sensitive personal information. Everything was fine, the government insisted: 'Nothing to see here. It's all a media beat-up'. After a couple of weeks of intense political and public pressure, Minister Hunt was dragged kicking and screaming into proposing two amendments to the scheme. Those amendments, requiring law enforcement agencies to get a warrant to access records and enabling the permanent deletion of records, were welcome ones, but they were also woefully inadequate as a response, addressing only a fraction of the privacy and security concerns that have been raised by concerned stakeholders. So Labor called for a comprehensive Senate inquiry to examine the system as a whole, to identify problems and to come up with solutions. The minister's response? He dismissed it as a stunt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's lucky we did initiate that inquiry, because it exposed a whole range of further problems with this scheme that must now be fixed, and that's why one month ago Labor proposed six substantive amendments to the government's woefully inadequate original bill. Labor's blueprint included tougher penalties for breaches of the act, changes to address concerns around domestic violence and employer access, and better safeguards to prevent the privatisation and commercialisation of the system, including through banning private health insurer access. The government at first refused to engage with us on these changes. Then, with just a week to go until the end of the opt-out period, the government suddenly realised we were right all along, and they've now scrambled to implement all of our fixes. That's something we, of course, welcome, but I will flag we now have one further amendment, which I will be detailing in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to be clear at the outset that Labor still supports the concept of a national digital health record scheme. That's why we established the personally controlled electronic health record under the leadership of the member for Sydney when last we were in government. We did it because we knew that the personally controlled electronic health record could deliver tangible benefits to clinicians and patients alike. It could improve coordination between GPs, specialists and hospitals and cut down on duplication and errors in diagnosis, prescriptions and treatments. And it could save our health system billions of dollars. It is an important 21st-century healthcare reform, and we continue to believe that My Health Record could save money and lives if implemented by a competent government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it's painfully clear that this is not a competent government, especially when it comes to digital service delivery. This is the government that gave us the census failure and robo-debt debacle, after all. In the health portfolio, this is the government that saw Medicare and the PBS data leaked and spent millions outsourcing the National Cancer Screening Register to Telstra in a contract that, several years later, still hasn't delivered a functioning system. And now we can add the implementation of My Health Record to that sad and sorry list. When the opt-out period for My Health Record began four months ago, it became clear that the government had bungled this vital program in two key ways. First, the government failed to communicate with Australians about the risks and benefits of My Health Record and what the opt-out system means in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opt-out model is a huge change from Labor's opt-in system. Every Australian will need to get a My Health Record unless they tell the government they don't want one. That means that, on the government's current timetable, about 17 million records will be created in the next few months. This moves the system from one of informed consent, a model that is fundamentally principled on the way that health professionals work together with those in their care. Informed consent is based on a very strong relationship of trust and is imbedded across the entire healthcare system. The government, in 2015, took the decision to move to a presumed consent model and provide a period in which people could choose to opt out of the system altogether. It is a significant change in the healthcare relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a reform like this to work, you have to bring people with you, but the government failed to bring both healthcare professionals and the Australian public along with these changes. There was no public information campaign designed to reach every Australian. It was almost as though the government didn't want people to know what was happening. The Digital Health Agency gave some money to Primary Health Networks to promote the reform. There have been rudimentary brochures printed and some stakeholder groups were given money to communicate with their members, but that was it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the opt-out trial sites, the government sent a letter to every person who would be registered for a My Health Record, informing them of the reformâwhat was happening, what their rights were and what they might need to do about it. That's a common and effective way for governments to communicate policy changes like this, but the government refused to send the same letter as part of the national rollout. It's only been in recent weeks, just before the opt-out period was due to end, that the government started rolling out a proper advertising campaign and it was only as a result of Labor's calls for just such a campaign. It's hard to believe. Again, the government had to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's second mistake was equally damning. Put simply, it's trying to implement an opt-out scheme on an opt-in foundation. Other than minor changes in 2015, the legislation and policies that underpin My Health Record were designed for the opt-in personally controlled electronic health record. In that system, the government could assume informed consent because every consumer with a record had actively chosen to have one. A number of My Health Record features made sense in that context. For example, default settings that keep a record relatively open make sense if someone has deliberately created that record; but, when every Australian gets a My Health Record, many of them without any real engagement, those settings are no longer appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those two fundamental blunders led to weeks of controversy on the My Health Record and finally forced the minister to announce the first of its changes. In its original form, this bill made just two changes to the My Health Records Act. First, it amended the act to require a court order or a consumer's express consent in order to disclose health information from My Health Record to law enforcement agencies or other government bodies. Even groups that are generally supportive of the My Health Record, like the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of GPs, had been alarmed by the government's previous insistence that a policy of the Digital Health Agency would suffice. The bill sets out a range of conditions under which a judicial officer may make a court order to disclose health information, including that the disclosure is reasonably necessary and that the requested information is not available from any other source. Second, the government's bill amended the act to require the permanent deletion of health information for all consumers who opt out of the My Health Record. The act currently requires the information that was held in the record to be locked down but retained until 30 years after the consumer's death. Again, that setting might have made sense when a consumer had previously opted in to the My Health Record and might want to rejoin the record in the future, but it makes no sense in an opt-out scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomed both of these changes, but it was clear to us, particularly after the Senate inquiry process, that those changes didn't go nearly far enough. That's why Labor flagged our intention to move six amendments to the bill. These amendments respond to a range of concerns raised by stakeholders during the inquiryâfrom clinicians, from the major health groups, from legal experts and from the unions. Lo and behold: a few weeks later the government announced that it would be amending its own legislation to match Labor's rescue plan. These changes will toughen penalties for breaches of the act, ensure that health insurers' employees can never access a person's My Health Record, strengthen the protections around the secondary use of identification data for research and public health purposes, address domestic violence concerns by ensuring that any parent with conditional access rights cannot be an authorised representative, explicitly prevent privatisation of the scheme, remove the ability of the scheme operator to delegate to an entity other than an APS employee of the Department of Health, and require that deletion of records also results in the deletion of copies, backups and previous versions of records.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all measures that Labor supports. Of course they are, because we came up with them. However, Labor still believes the government must delay the My Health Record rollout by extending the opt-out period. That brings me to Labor's new amendment, which will require the government to extend the opt-out period for a further 12 months, which is in line with a key recommendation of the recent Senate inquiry into the e-health system. We're seeking to make this sensible change because the Morrison government is refusing to do so itself. It is imperative that the rollout does not advance further until all privacy and security concerns are fully addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this legislation goes some way, there are lingering concerns. A 12-month extension will give the government time to commission and implement a Privacy Commissioner review to address outstanding concerns about system settings. If they don't do that, a Shorten Labor government will. The Senate inquiry found that the government's botched implementation of the opt-out model means that an unreasonable compromise has been struck between ensuring the utility of the system and safeguarding the privacy and safety of healthcare recipients. That's why we want a Privacy Commissioner review that would consider, among other things, the appropriate balance between utility for clinicians, patients and others, such as carers; privacy and security for individuals; the difficulty of ensuring informed consent in an opt-out model; measures to encourage consumer engagement and informed choice; changes to default access settings that are necessary because of the shift to an opt-out model from an opt-in model where informed consent was assured; and particular protections for vulnerable people, including minors aged 14 to 17 and families fleeing domestic violence. A 12-month extension will also give the government time to reach every Australian with its new public information campaign so that people can make a fully informed choice about whether they want to opt out of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the government's current timetable, the opt-out period is due to finish this week. Once it does, the government will begin creating records for 17 million Australians whether they want one or not. This will occur even though the government hasn't actually passed this legislation yet. In fact, it cannot pass it before the opt-out period ends, meaning that some Australians may opt out unnecessarily over concerns that are addressed by the legislation. Assuming that the Senate agrees to this bill, with or without formal amendment, it will need to return to the lower house for approval. But the lower house doesn't sit again until the end of the monthâ10 days after the opt-out period endsâmeaning that there's no guarantee that this legislation will even pass this year. And next year is an election year. As we know, an election could be called before parliament returns. The My Health Record rollout must not advance until the clean-up legislation has passed the parliament. As I said at the outset, Labor supports e-health, but we have to get this right. The government's bungling very nearly killed off this reform. Let's take the time now to fix this mess.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  The My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018 amends the My Health Records Act 2012 to strengthen the privacy provisions of the My Health Record system. Some of the key provisions of the bill that we are debating today include the addition of a requirement for the system operator to permanently destroy a My Health Record, should the healthcare recipient cancel their registration for a record, and for any information in that record to be deleted. In other words, if somebody asks for their record to be destroyed, a backup copy can't be kept and can't be accessed at a future point in time; it will be destroyed permanently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue involved in this legislation is ensuring that we limit disclosure of the information to designated law enforcement and government agencies and make sure they can only access this information through a court order. That is as it should be. We know, though, that the government defended the existing legislation, stating that it didn't believe that this information could be provided to law enforcement officers outside of the provision of a court order, and yet the Minister for Health was proven to be demonstrably wrong on that point of fact. That's why this bill is necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill arose as a result of significant community pressure having been put on the government, because what we are now seeing is the administration of a major change in terms of people's sensitive, private health information. When these changes were first announced, Minister Hunt said that the legislation would be passed and resolved before the end of the opt-out period. That is as it should be. These are changes that should be passed before we end the opt-out period for the My Health Record. The opt-out period closes tomorrow, and this legislation won't be passed, as we heard from the previous contribution, until this bill goes to the lower house, which is weeks away. The most sensible course of action would have been to extend the opt-out period at least until this legislation was passed. Yet, what we're seeing are a range of changes to a piece of critically important health information being introduced at the same time as people will have a record created for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are going to have a My Health Record created as a result of the end of the opt-out period. It will happen by default. Many people in the community are not even aware that they will have this record created for them. Yet, legislation to control the way in which their record is managed won't be passed for weeksâand we don't have the certainty of knowing that it will indeed pass. It makes perfect sense to wait until this legislation is passed before considering any opt-out period, and yet, the government, because they are only interested in protecting their reputation, not protecting the community, are pressing ahead with this legislation at this time, with the opt-out period closing tomorrow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we're debating today was referred by Labor and the Greens to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee because of the significant concerns that members of the community held. There were concerns not just from patients and healthcare recipients but also from a number of the peak health bodiesâall of them expressing very serious concerns. Privacy organisations also expressed concerns during the commencement of the opt-out period. As a result of that inquiry, we learnt of a number of serious issues that were yet to be resolved with My Health Record. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me put on the record from the outset that we, the Greens, are absolutely supportive of the purpose of creating an electronic health record system. If executed properly, it is a significant benefit to both individual patients and the broader community, in terms of public health. If done properly, this is a reform that will be good for people and good for the Australian nation. I can tell you as a former GP, somebody who spent countless hours scribbling down medical notes, receiving notes from some of my professional medical colleagues, trying to decipher that health informationâand there is a running joke about doctors' handwriting but in all of these stereotypes there's often some truth to itâit is often very difficult to get access to that information. That's if you can get it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oftentimes, people present to us after having seen another doctor, after having had pathology tests done through another medical service, after sometimes having presented to an emergency department or a major hospital. As a treating GP, you don't get access to any of that information. It's remarkable that here we are in the 21st century and, often, the only way to get information to a medical practice is via the use of telephone or fax. Some of these medical facilities are not even established to process information through email. So we rely on fax and telephone. That remains the case today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you think about it, often, people will come from having had a specialist appointment, because there is a complex medical issue that needs to be addressed, and as the treating practitioner you don't get access to that information. A blood test could have been done. An MRI could have been done. That person could have been referred to another medical service. There is no record of that information unless each of those individual services provide that information to the treating practitioner in a timely way. At the moment, it just doesn't happen. Our medical record system in Australia has more in common with 1970s health practice than it does with a modern 21st century health system. And it has huge consequences. It has enormous consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most common reasons for people getting into trouble, in terms of side effects from drugs, is not just because of the drug that has been prescribed but because of drug interactions. One of the things a medical practitioner needs to be aware of before we make a decision to prescribe a second drug is what drug has already been prescribed. Drug interactions are very serious. We know that they're a cause of significant iatrogenic illness, medically induced illness. Rather than helping somebody by writing a prescription, we might be doing something that can cause serious side effects. Sometimesârarely, but it does happenâit can be fatal. Drug interactions are very serious, and they could be resolved if we knew, if we had up-to-date information, of people's medication history every time we wrote a prescription.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important if somebody has been to a major hospital where they've had some sort of intervention. It may be surgical intervention or it may not. They may have been in a ward where their medication has been adjusted, where a new medication has been started. In many instances, we don't get the discharge summary from the hospital. What happens in that circumstance is that you have no idea what drug has been prescribed, what intervention has taken place or what tests have been done. Sometimes, when it comes to analysing pathology results, the only way we can determine there's an issue is by tracing those results over time. You track a particular level, for example, of someone's kidney function, over time, to see if their kidney function is deteriorating or stable. The only way you can do that is to look at a series of tests, over time. Still, today, tests are done at different facilities. The results are sent back to different practitioners and that information isn't located in a central place. A practitioner needs to get access to that information so they can diagnose a problem and provide treatment, in a timely way, because they realise that something is going on for their patient. They won't realise that if they don't have access to all of those pathology tests. So it's a critically important piece of health infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the situation where sometimes people present in acute painâI've been in that situation beforeâand they might request analgesia. We know that opiates are very effective pain relievers in the short term. We know that providing somebody with an opiate medication, whether it be something like Panadeine Forte or oxycodoneâOxyContin as it's knownâare very effective. But we also know that there are significant risks with associated dependence. We also know that doctor shopping goes on; we know that some people who become dependent on these drugs will visit different surgeries in an attempt to get access to that medication. We now know that the most common cause of overdose death in Australia is not from heroin but actually from pharmaceutical opiatesâmedically prescribed opiates. More people are dying from prescriptions made in doctors' surgeries than they are from illicit heroin in the streets. My Health Record has huge potential for helping us to address that challenge.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, again, it has enormous advantages. I'm just looking at Senator Seselja, who looks like he's challenging that information. If he has an interjection to make, I'm quite happy to take that interjectionâ</span>

                    </a>  But the issue is that there's great potential here. We know that this can provide significant benefits to those people who have chronic complex illnesses and who are seeing multiple medical practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the problem at the heart of this bill is that we're undertaking a major change without due consideration given to many of the concerns that were raised right through the Senate inquiry relating to people being able to control their own information and relating to privacy and anonymity. Many of those concerns I raised back in 2012, when this legislation was being debated. Here we are, six years later, and many of the concerns I raised back then in 2012 have come to light. So here we are right nowâat the last minute, with the opt-out period ending tomorrowârushing legislation through the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation does represent an improvement to the existing legislation. It's an important start, and that's why we will support the passage of the amendments to the My Health Record that are proposed in this legislation. But we also have other concerns that aren't addressed in the legislation. Let's get to what the bill covers initially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, permanent deletion of records is critical. Currently, the system operator is required to retain a person's healthcare information for 30 years after the death of the healthcare recipient, or, if the date of death is unknown, for 130 years, even if the person has requested that their My Health Record be cancelled. If someone wants their record cancelled, it should be cancelled. A range of community groups expressed significant concerns about this provision but, again, it's an example of where the legislation was drafted clumsily. So we are going to support that amendment, something that we raised through that committee process to ensure that the system operator must permanently destroy a My Health Record. We will support that part of the legislation and will introduce a further amendment to ensure that this deletion is as complete as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On access to the My Health Record by groups other than the person who intended to access it: of course, one of the other elements that the health minister outlined was that law enforcement agencies wouldn't get access to this information unless they had a warrant, but he was then shown to be wrong. That is a great concern, and so we absolutely want to see access by law enforcement officers only through a court order. We strongly support the introduction of subsection 63(5), which limits the laws that authorise the collection, use and disclosure of My Health Record information. It does mean that entities seeking to access it need a court order to do so. That's very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we do understand that the government will be introducing a number of amendments, and we also understand that Labor and Centre Alliance will also introduce amendments. I'm flagging now that we will support the government's amendments and we will support many of those other amendments put by Labor and the crossbench. We are also introducing an amendment to ensure the privacy of the information of young adults, 14- to 17-year-oldsâadolescents who are becoming adults. In order to prevent the parents of 14- to 17-year-olds accessing their child's record without explicit consent, we want to make sure that, given this significant change, young people have control over their own health information. Often, a young person might be going to see a GP and they'll be seeking medication. It might be for a sexually transmitted disease; it might simply be for contraception. That is information that that young person should feel confident will remain within the realm of the treating doctor and the patient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, for 14- to 17-year-olds, we have something known as competent minors. If you're a young person and a doctor assesses that you're able to make this judgement for yourself, the doctor will respect your privacy and determine that you are able to make that judgement on your own. Under the current legislation, a parent of somebody aged 14 to 17 can access the child's record electronically. It couldn't happen under the current system. You'd have to ring the medical practice. The medical practice would then speak to the person involved. If the person involved said, 'No, I don't want Mum to see it,' the doctor wouldn't accede to that request. Under the current system, you can do that. We want to protect that private information. It's sensitive information. That says to a young person that you should, if you're getting into trouble with drug abuse, if you want to access contraception or if you have a tricky mental health issueâit may be, as I said, a sexually transmitted diseaseâfeel confident to know that you can go and have that conversation with your GP and that that information will be private if you want it to be private. That's the case at the moment, and we should respect that. With this change, we should make sure that young people are afforded those protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the government have indicated that they understand this is a concern. They've also indicated that there may be problems with making that change. We acknowledge that, but, on benefit, we are planning to introduce an amendment, because we think that protection is absolutely critical. The government have indicated that they are looking at referring this to an inquiry. We will support an inquiry should our amendment failâwe hope it won'tâbut it is too critical to be left simply to a review, where we don't have a set reporting date and there's no confirmation about what action will take place subsequent to that review. We want the confidence to know that, if you're 14 to 17, your information will be kept private should you wish it to be private. The review can continue and, if there are any other additional changes then we can look at introducing those after that amendment is passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We absolutely agree that Labor's call, which is indeed a joint call, to extend the opt-out period is the right call. We think that extending it for a period of 12 months is the right call. Indeed, we put forward a motion to the parliament to do just that. This is a big, big change. People need time to come to grips with this change. They need to understand how this information is managed and then they need to make some decisions about how they want their own personal information to be managed. Some people will feel very comfortable with the minimum, default settings, and they will continue, happily, to trust doctors, the public health community and, indeed, government with that sensitive information. Others won't, and right now there are too many members of the Australian community who are not aware that this change is taking place, who don't have the information at hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do think that Australians have got a right to make an informed choice about this, and they haven't been given that opportunity. Indeed, everything that's happened so far has undermined confidence in the system. The minister's own statements about issuing court orders demonstrate that he himself is not on top of this piece of legislation, so we think that an amendment to extend the opt-out period to force the government to address these concerns and to bring the Australian community with us is absolutely critical, and we will be supporting it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018. This is a very, very important bill, and one which we really have to get right. But, regretfully, it's been pretty clear, in the minds of the Australian people, that this government has failed in its management of the rollout of the My Health Record system. I'm disappointed that this government's failures have led to such unnecessary anxiety and distress and have seriously damaged public trust in a system that should have provided a positive outcome for health care in Australia. It's clear, once again, that the government's myopic focus on internal politics has kept them from governing sensibly, responsibly and in the interests of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: Labor support e-health and the concept of the My Health Record. It was Labor that kickstarted the development and implementation of an electronic health record system when we were last in office. The electronic health records could provide significant improvements to the way Australians receive health care. Some of the advantages include: improving coordination between GPs, specialists and hospitals; and cutting down on duplication and errors in diagnosis, prescriptions and treatments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Implemented by a competent government, e-health records could deliver tangible healthcare improvements while making cost savings that could be reinvested in the healthcare system. Implemented by a competent government, e-health records could save lives. However, this government have demonstrated gross incompetence and have seriously botched the implementation of their opt-out scheme. Those opposite have a track record of dramatically failing in their implementation of information technology solutions, and it was this governmentâwe should all remember thisâthat gave us the census and the robo-debt debacles. Disappointingly, we've also seen Medicare and PBS data leaked and the absolutely disastrous outsourcing of the National Cancer Screening Register to Telstra, which still hasn't delivered a functioning system. Only a government as incompetent as this one could roll out a second-rate National Broadband Network using outdated technology and yet still experience delays and cost blowouts. Now we can see the added implementation of the My Health Record system, and we can add that to that sorry list. The blame for this lies squarely at the feet of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor tried to warn the government that their My Health Record implementations were flawed. Even as far back as 2015, which I think is when the My Health Record bill was passed, Labor shadow minister Catherine King moved a second reading amendment which noted 'the inadequacy of this bill in making real improvements to a national electronic health record system'. Although the government voted down the amendment, wouldn't you think that they would have at least heeded its warning and maybe had a look at it? But they didn't, and just last month we found ourselves once again trying to clean up another government mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The e-health system Labor began implementing was opt in, and we thought that was the right approachâso anyone who participated had to give informed consent. However, the changes made by the government in 2015 moved the system from one of informed consent to one of presumed consent. Informed consent is a foundational principle on the way that health professionals work together with those in care. It's based on a very strong relationship of trust and is embedded across the entire healthcare system. Moving to a presumed consent model and providing a period in which people could choose to opt out of the system altogether was a very significant change. It was both legal and ideological, as well as representing a significant change in the healthcare relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bringing both healthcare professionals and the Australian public along with these changes is absolutely essential to its success. It requires properly and consistently explaining to the Australian public not just how the opt-out system works but why this change is even necessary. However, the government decided in its own stubborn way and without proper public debateâyet againâto make My Health Record an opt-out system. They failed, in their arrogance, to properly explain why or even to make a vague attempt to educate the public about their approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their failure to communicate has fuelled many of the privacy and security concerns Australians have had about My Health Record. It's these concerns that have led to more than 1.1 million Australians opting out of having a My Health Record since the beginning of the opt-out period. The government could have communicated with the Australian public quite easily. The government could have sent Australians a letter, like they did in the small opt-out trial sites that they ran, but they choose not to do that, obviously embarrassed by the mistake of sending letters in the trial sites to people who were deceased. They could have run TV advertisementsâand, let's be honest, the government generally have no problem running advertisements that promote their policiesâbut they didn't do that either. While the Australian Digital Health Agency could afford to spend $81 million on consultants last year alone, it's disappointing that they couldn't spend money explaining a fundamental change to how Australians' private health data is stored and shared. In July, as the opt-out period began, all of the criticisms that the government hoped to keep quiet came flooding out. While the botched rollout of the opt-out period occurred under Mr Turnbull's government and undermined public trust in the important reform, it's really disappointing that the Morrison government still couldn't get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill responds to public anger over the scheme by making some changes that Labor welcomes. The changes include requiring law enforcement and other government agencies to get a court order to access records and permanently deleting the health information of people who opt out of the My Health Record. These are positive changes, and we support them, but, as Labor senators noted in the reports of two Senate inquiriesâone into the bill itself and another into the My Health Record system more generallyâthe changes in the bill do not go far enough. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquired into this bill and reported on 12 October 2018. Despite the Minister for Health dismissing the inquiry as a stunt, which is typical of this government's approach, the completed inquiry revealed a range of serious flaws in the current legislation that were not addressed by the government's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had grave concerns about whether the bill sufficiently protects vulnerable people. For example, this bill does nothing to address concerns that My Health Record may risk the safety of women fleeing from abusive partners, or children needing privacy from non-custodial parents. Workers have also raised concerns that doctors who perform pre-employment or workers' compensation assessments may pass health information to employers and that employers could use this information to discriminate against employeesâfor example, on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions. These are basic flaws that need to be fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submitters to the Senate inquiry had important points to make about their concerns with the bill, and I'd just like to share a few with the chamber. Australian Lawyers Alliance expressed concern. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the inadequate measures in place to protect the medical records in the My Health database from 'coercive sharing', where individuals may be coerced into providing access to their medical records when applying for employment or seeking insurance products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Association of Social Workers strongly recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ much greater consideration needs to be given to victims and survivors of family violence, including safeguards to assure that the record is not used to further perpetuate abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their submission, the Australian Medical Association expressed concerns about insurers having access to the data. The AMA told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The AMA shares the media concern that health insurers should not have access to My Health Record data. Their interest in this data presents a clear conflict of interest between the financial benefit of avoiding fund members who are high risk claimants and their obligations to abide by the principles of community rating. The <span style="font-style:italic;">My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Bill 2018</span> presents an opportunity for a further amendment to the Bill to remove all doubt data sharing with health insurers will occur at some point in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor senators, in their dissenting report on the inquiry, signalled our intention to move amendments to this bill. We want to ensure that the My Health Record can never be privatised or commercialised; that private health insurers can never access My Health Record, including de-identified data; that employees' right to privacy is protected in the context of employer directed health care by including a clause similar to section 14(2) of the Healthcare Identifiers Act in the My Health Records Act; that vulnerable children and parents, such as those fleeing domestic violence, are protected by narrowing the definition of parental responsibility; and that the system operator, the Australian Digital Health Agency, cannot delegate access to My Health Record to other entities. These amendments seek to address concerns raised by medical professionals, law experts, domestic violence advocates and unions throughout the course of the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also initiated the broader Senate Standing Community on Affairs Reference Committee inquiry into the My Health Record framework as a whole. This inquiry focused on elements of the system that are beyond the scope of this bill such as the government's position to switch to an opt-out system, the communication of this change, and default settings with the record. The report of the references committee inquiry was tabled on 18 October. This report had several recommendations relating to privacy and security. They included that access codes be applied to each record as a default and can only be overridden in an urgent situation, that the privacy of 14- to 17-year-old children be protected and that the period for which a My Health Record can be suspended in the case of serious risk to the healthcare recipient be extended, as well as a range of recommendations strengthening protections against the use of My Health Record data for secondary commercial, employment or insurance purposes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcomed the government's announcement just last week that they will be taking up Labor's suggestions and moving amendments to this bill to address the numerous concerns raised by stakeholders. For several weeks Labor has had these sensible changes on the table, yet the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt, has refused to engage with us. They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it is simply not good enough that the government is scrambling to implement our changes at the eleventh hour. With only tomorrow before the end of the opt-out period, it's absolutely vital that the period be extended. This bill and the government's amendments will not pass the parliament in time for important privacy and security provisions to be put in place before the end of the opt-out period. The House of Reps doesn't even sit again for more than a week after the opt-out period ends, and it's not sitting this week either. This means that some Australians may actually opt out because of the privacy concerns that could have been addressed by the bill when it finally passes. Rather than rushing at the last minute to fix its My Health Record mess, the government actually needs to take a deep breath, take a step back and take the time to get this reform right.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has joined Labor's call passing, I think, Senator Watt's motion on Monday which calls on the government to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ extend or suspend the opt-out period until the legislation and any amendments are passed, outstanding privacy and security issues are addressed and public confidence in this important reform is restored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also called on the government, given the numerous privacy and security concerns raised about My Health Record, to commission an independent review of the My Health Record system by the Privacy Commissioner and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. This review should consider the appropriate balance between utility for clinicians, patients and others, such as carers, and privacy and security for individuals; the difficulty of ensuring informed consent in an opt-out model and measures to encourage consumer engagement and informed choice; changes to default access settings that are necessary because of the shift to an opt-out model; particular protection for vulnerable people, including minors aged between 14 and 17 and families fleeing domestic violence; and further legislative policy and system changes that are needed to achieve these aims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our concerns and our call for an independent review have been given further impetus by recent revelations now that the Australian Digital Health Agency's director of privacy has quit. An article<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>in<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>on<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>9 November said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ sources close to Ms Hunt confirmed that she had left the business out of frustration that privacy and security concerns her team had raised with senior management were often ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the sources was quoted as saying ADHA's privacy staff were 'disillusioned', that there was a pattern of 'not listening' at senior levels of the ADHA and within the health minister's office and that concerns were treated simply as management or public relations issues. That's not good enough. It's understood that, of the agency's privacy team, which consisted of four staff, one has moved overseas and another is going on leave for 12 months. With the director's departure, this will leave just one dedicated privacy staff member at the ADHA from December, and that's pretty concerning; in fact, it's extremely concerning. The fact is that there are privacy concerns being raised, not just by Labor and not just by stakeholders in the submissions to the Senate inquiries but within the ADHA itself, and that adds a great deal of weight to our call for an independent privacy review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also adding weight to the call for an independent review is the recent news that 99 My Health Record data breaches have been reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, including 11 breaches since 1 July this year. At the same time as the OAIC was reporting multiple breaches over the course of the past six years, a spokesperson for the health minister claimed there has never been a reported security breach of the system. Why is there a disparity between the reports of the OAIC and the minister about whether data breaches have occurred and how many? The conflicting claims of the minister's office against those of the OAIC, the concerns raised by not one but two Senate inquiries and the reports from within the agency itself all demonstrate the vital importance of an independent privacy review of the My Health Record system. They also strongly support the case for an extension to the opt-out period. As I said before, the deadline for that is 15 Novemberâthat's tomorrowâso this suspension must be announced immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will be moving an amendment to this bill to insert a 12-month extension. A 12-month extension will give the government time to run a new public information campaign that reaches every Australian and allows them to make a fully informed choice about whether to opt out of the scheme. It would also give the government plenty of time to commission an independent review of outstanding privacy concerns with the system. We welcome the government's attempt to finally fix the flaws in this bill, but this bill should be the first step to fixing their My Health Record mess, not the last.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Had the government agreed to work constructively with Labor to fix the problems with the rollout rather than be obnoxious and say, 'We know best and we know how to do everything,' we may have been able to help save them from their own shambolic mess. If they heed Labor's call to extend the opt-out period and to commission an independent review of the privacy and security concerns, they just might be able to restore the trust to the medical profession and the broader Australian public. Unfortunately, for this incompetent government, public confidence in their ability to implement this important reform is currently at an all-time low. But it's not just the government who will suffer from the mess that they've created. Until this mess is fixed, millions of ordinary Australians will miss out on the benefits of an electronic health record because they cannot trust the privacy and the security of the Morrison government's My Health Record. I urge the government and crossbenchers to support Labor's sensible amendment for an extension of the opt-out period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I think everyone in this place would agree that Australians should have the right to privacy. Our health records are the most highly personal information. It's information that we entrust to medical professionals acting in our best interests. I cannot think of a more important privacy relationship than that between a patient and their health professional. That is why it is so important that we get this My Health Record model right. What is clear from the Senate inquiry that has gone into this legislation is that currently we don't have it rightâso much so that, as we speak, thousands, if not now millions, of Australians are on their phones and on the internet opting out of the My Health Record scheme proposed by the government. This government has lost the public trust debate, and that is why Labor has made it very clear that we want to put in place amendments to this legislation to put back the public trust that is so needed in this My Health Record debacle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This debacle isn't the only one there has been, when we look at the government's record in the area of information technology. The government have a woeful track record on IT security and privacy. They botched the rollout of the NBN, they botched the rollout of the NDIS, they gave us a census fail and they gave us the robo-debt debacleâand now they have stuffed up My Health Record. If you look at the record of this government and its previous versions on sensitive data security, I think the Centrelink robo-debt debacle stands out, with lots of bells and whistles on. But, then again, what about the immigration department database breach that put the lives of asylum seekers at risk by revealing their details? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a couple of examples of how this government has simply failed when it comes to information technology security and privacy, and that is why Labor is calling on the government to extend the deadline for My Health Record to go live, which it is due to do from tomorrow. In fact, my Senate colleague Senator Watt successfully passed a motion in this place this week asking for exactly that. I think the Senate, and indeed the government, should respect the passing of that motion and the amendment that Labor put forward to ensure that that happens for the sake of all of the Australians who are worried today, and who have a right to be worried, because this government cannot be trusted in how it is dealing with these sensitive privacy and security issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also deeply concerned about some of the failings in this bill as it stands without amendment. I'm deeply concerned by the potential use by third parties of patient information. I think there is definitely a need for further protections for privacy and security, both in legislation and in policy. We need a government that will take all Australians with them to do that, to discuss and educate them about the benefits of My Health Record, which there clearly are, but also the risks, so that everyone can make an informed choice about whether to participate or not. That takes time, and it is something that this government hasn't done. It has failed to do that, which is why we're asking for an extension of the deadline. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have witnessed a stream of health data breaches in Australia and overseas, and the incentives for these breaches are only increasing. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Storing records digitally with online access greatly increases their accessibility for criminals, hackers and snoopers. Health records are valuable as a means of identity theft due to the wealth of personal information they contain. They are a huge prize for hackers, fetching a high price on the Dark Web.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is really concerning, and I think everyone would share that concern. But, when discussing a medical condition with their doctor, Australians should not be concerned that it will end up in the wrong hands. There really should be the most searching review into the operations and behaviour of the Digital Health Agency, the ministers who signed off on this and the costs of the public disinformation campaign so far that has, I think, misled not only the parliament but, more importantly, the public. It needs to be reversed. We need to have information. We need to have education about the benefits and the risks, and that case simply has not been made by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to remember very clearly some of the rhetoric that's come out of Minister Greg Hunt on this issue. I know that the government has now put itself in a position to bring forward amendments of its own bill, but I think we all need to remember that these changes the minister is making he was forced to make. He was not going to make any changes to My Health Record. These are not changes that he willingly has made. If you remember when Labor initiated the Senate inquiry, this health minister said it was a stunt. For a minister of the crown, of this government, to claim that the important process of legislative investigation through Senate inquiryâinto something so pivotal, so important, when you're talking about privacy and securityâwas a stunt but then to go further and acknowledge, through the findings of that Senate inquiry, that his legislation was flawed and did need amendment and that he has now brought forward those amendments shows very clearly the failings of this minister. It also shows that he has provided disinformation to the Australian people on what he set out to do in the first place. Of course, they've now amended their own legislation. But I think we needed a much more informed consent model, and we didn't have that from this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just those of us who were on the Senate inquiry or consumers who are raising some of these concerns; they are coming from health professionals themselves. They're coming from doctors themselves, who've made it very clear, saying, 'Yes, we want to have this partnership with patients.' They think the idea of the My Health Record is important but they also want to make sure that this relationship is not in any way jeopardised by the notion that the information is automatically shared and that patients can't have full control of it. They've raised those concerns throughout this process, particularly throughout this important Senate inquiry process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, my home state, doctors have approached me with their own concerns. They have made me very aware of their worries about this simple tick-a-box approach. Errors on requests for pathology imaging tests can occur. Poorly edited shared health summaries or errors with pharmacy dispensing notifications may cause unintended or incorrect uploads of data, particularly with the My Health Record. Tasmanian doctors have made me aware of their concerns about what these records will mean for young people. They can foresee an inordinate amount of extra time and effort to ensure that their young patients completely understand the structure, the methodology and the supposed benefits but also likely risks of My Health Record and the real need for them to be alert for exposure of their sensitive information if they do not have control of their personal My Health Record. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The possible and increasing threats to their personal information coming from cyberspace, I think, are real. But the negative publicity around My Health Record also gives the likelihood that teenagers mayâthis is an unintended consequenceârefuse to consult with their doctor, or other health professional such as psychologists, through the Medicare system. That would be terrible. To have a loss of faith would be catastrophic for Australian health care, with serious consequences for those patients over not just the short and medium term but also the long term. The doctors I've spoken to do fear it would all but destroy that long accepted recognition by young people that doctors will safeguard the confidentiality of their records. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's privacy and scrutiny concerns about this were clearly expressed through the Senate inquiry process and through the committee report process. We laid bare the government's botched implementation of this opt-out model. We made additional comments in that report which urged the government to commission an independent review of the My Health Record system by the Privacy Commissioner and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which has itself called for further consideration of several privacy and security concerns. In particular, we highlight that the Privacy Commissioner and the OAIC should consider the appropriate balance between the utilities, the clinicians, patients and others, such as carers; privacy and security for individuals; the difficulty of ensuring informed consent in an opt-out model; measures to encourage consumer engagement and informed choice; and changes to default access settings that are necessary because of this shift to an opt-out model from our original opt-in model, where informed consent was assured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is part of the big problem here: the fact that the government has changed this from an opt-in modelâwhich is what Labor's proposal and the legislation were originallyâto an opt-out model means that the issue of informed consent is limited and jeopardised. Further, we ask for particular protections for vulnerable people, including minors aged 14 to 17 and families fleeing domestic violence. Further legislative policy and system changes are needed to achieve these aims, but in the meantime I think that the government does need to heed Labor's call and support Labor's amendmentâand I urge the crossbench to do likewiseâto suspend the opt-out rollout until the Privacy Commissioner and the OAIC report is taken into account, until the government makes those necessary changes and until public confidence in this important reform is restored. That's all going to take time. It's simply not going to happen overnight and it's simply not going to happen by tomorrow, with that date looming for the government's proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to explain to the people of Australia what it's doing to minimise these risks, otherwise the whole enterprise will be hobbled by distrust and scepticism, and we'll never move away from that. This reform needs public support to work and, unfortunately, that's where the government has failed. We certainly support the amendments that the government will be moving, particularly in relation to issues around domestic violence, employers and workers compensation. But these are all amendments, as I said earlier, that we signalled months ago. Of course we're pleased that the government is basically picking up Labor's recommendations now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, that said, we still think there are issues around the default settings of My Health Record that do require the Australian Privacy Commissioner to have a look at this whole thing again. We think that 12 months is a reasonable time for our Privacy Commissioner to look at this, to see whether those default settings are right. And at the same time that is going on, throughout that 12-month period government could be running an education campaign, not just telling people about the benefits of My Health Record but actually telling them what they need to do to actively manage this very important piece of health informationâtheir My Health Record. There needs to be that consumer confidence put into the system, and it's simply not there at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that what has also been clear is the role of and concern about the Digital Health Agency, in particular: what exactly are doctors being paid to sign up their patients to do, and what for? What information about access and usage has or has not been fullyâor at allâdisclosed to them? Again, those are unknowns. I think, though, implemented by a competent government, e-health could deliver tangible healthcare improvements and save healthcare costs through perhaps fewer diagnosis, treatment and prescription errors. I think that that could actually work. But what we don't want to see is people's patient health records falling into the wrong hands. We certainly don't want to see it privatisedâthere should be no privatisation of patient recordsâand we don't want to see it falling into the wrong third-party hands at any cost at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, when we began delivering on electronic health record systems when we were last in office, our system was an opt-in system. We thought that that was the right approach. Anyone who participated had to give informed consent; they had to give their full, informed consent. But this government has failed on that completely. Worse, it seems to have actively refused to communicate with Australians about the risks to My Health Record and what this opt-out system means in practice. What worries me today is how many Australians are unaware and do not realise that tomorrow is the deadline for opting out of this model if they choose to do so. Very concerning to me today is the fact that they haven't been given that education, communicated by government, of what this opt-out system means to them and what the risks and the benefits of their My Health Record are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the absolute failure by Minister Greg Hunt and this government to communicate has fuelled so much of the privacy and security concerns that Australians quite rightly have about My Health Record. It didn't have to have come to this, but it has because of the failure of this government. When the Senate Community Affairs References Committee was scrutinising the My Health Record system in September, representatives of the Australian Digital Health Agency conceded that more than 900,000 Australians at that point had already opted out of My Health Record. It is well over a million today, and goodness knows how many more by tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With one day left before the deadline my message to Australians is: please make yourself informed today about the options and about not only the benefits but also the risks. Choose what you want to do today, whether or not you wish to opt-out. But, more importantly, my pitch this morning to this chamber, to the government and to the crossbench is: please support Labor's amendments. Support these amendments to ensure that we put back in place the trust that Australians need in this My Health Record model. We need more time to get this right. It is nowhere near right as it currently stands, despite the government's amendments that they were dragged here to put forward. We need more time, we need the review and we need to ensure that Australians trust what we are doing when we say we want to ensure we have a great health system with a digital capacity to improve efficiencies. We are simply not there yet. Please support Labor's amendments to this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I rise to join my Labor colleagues in expressing a number of concerns about the My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018 and about the government's rollout of the My Health Record in general. What an absolute train wreck. From a government that we've seen botch technology rollout after technology rollout after technology rollout, here we are again with yet another one, in the form of the My Health Record. You really have to ask yourself: is this Australia's worst ever government when it comes to rolling out the basic technology that Australians deserve and expect in the modern era?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government that has presided over an absolute shemozzle of a rollout of the NBN, something that was supposed to connect all Australians to the worldâto give all Australians, no matter where they lived, the opportunity to plug into the best technology available in the world and connect to people right around Australia and right around the world. But this government has completely botched the rollout of the NBN, to the point where not a day goes by where my officeâand I'm sure the offices of every other senator hereâgets contacted by people, in my case in Central Queensland and around the Gold Coast, whose businesses are suffering and whose kids' ability to do their homework and assignments is suffering from this government's inability to properly roll out the NBN. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got the NBN fail. We've also got the census fail from this government. It's a long time ago now, but who can forget the absolute debacle that this government's rollout of an electronic census system was? At one point there was speculation that governments from overseas were hacking the system, but in reality it turned out to be yet another technology fail from this government. We then had robo-debtâan absolutely tragic, poor rollout of technology by this government, which I was involved in, in the form of a Senate inquiry, where Australians right around the country were being falsely accused by their government of owing thousands of dollars in debts to Centrelink that they actually didn't owe. That was all because this government put in place a technological system that wasn't built properly, and the result was that people were being falsely accused of owing thousands of dollars and having debt collectors sent around to their doors to pursue debts that never actually existed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Still in the health field, we've had the ongoing disaster that is the National Cancer Screening Register. That was one of the first issues that I dealt with as a new senator a bit over a couple of years ago. I think it was the first Senate inquiry that I participated inâthe legislation to put in place the National Cancer Screening Register. We were told repeatedly by officials from the Department of Health that, if we didn't pass that legislation urgently and get the Cancer Screening Register up and running, then, putting it bluntly, people would die, because cancer screening wouldn't be done in the way that it should be. Well, more than two years onâeven after we did our job and passed the legislation quickly, despite reservationsâthe Cancer Screening Register is still not up and running. From what we were told by the department back at the time, people's lives in Australia are being put in danger because of this government's failure to properly roll out technology. Now we have the latest oneâthe My Health Record. It has been a rolling disaster from this government, from its poor information campaign when it was first being rolled out to today, when we are seeing media reports say that the system in is meltdown because it cannot cope with the number of people who are dialling in or using the internet to try to opt out of a system that they have no confidence in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make very clear that Labor has always supported and continues to support e-health and moving health care to online mechanisms. But it is no surprise that the My Health Record system is in meltdown today, because Australians don't have confidence in this government's ability to roll out new technology in a way that safeguards their privacy and in a way that works properly. And it's no wonder that Australians have no confidence in this new My Health Record, because of that litany of failure that we've seen from this government across the NBN, across the census, across robo-debt, across the Cancer Screening Registerâand I haven't even talked about the data breaches that we keep reading about from government technology systems as well. Time after time after time, this government has dropped the ball when it comes to technology rollout, usually resulting in massive cost increases for taxpayers to bear as well. It's no surprise then that people have completely lost confidence in what should be a really fundamental part of our health system in this day and age. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For as long as I've been involved in health policy, going back to my days in the Queensland government more than 10 years ago, the establishment of a good e-health record has been pretty much the Holy Grail when it comes to delivering good quality, modern health care. Any health professional you talk to will tell youâand they have told us for many, many yearsâthat having an e-health record that captures all information about a patient, their health needs and their health experiences is essential to providing the best-quality health care that Australians need and making sure that people are prescribed the right drugs, that we get away from this system where records and notes are held by a hospital in one place. These records might refer to the fact that someone has an allergy to a particular medication, but that's not very good if you go to another hospital, if you're on holidays, and that hospital doesn't know that you're allergic to a particular medicine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a really basic example of how having an e-health record would make a massive difference to the health care of Australians: making sure that they get the right medication and making sure that they don't get medications that they are allergic to, let alone the cost to the system that is incurred when people are provided with the wrong medicines or when other features of a particular patient aren't known by a treating practitioner. These are the kinds of benefits that can come from establishing an e-health record. That's why Labor has been so supportive of this, going back to when we were in government and first introduced the earlier version of the personally controlled electronic health record. But the way this government has now gone to try to change the way the health record operates and the way it has rolled it outâbacked up with its terrible record in rolling out technologyâis why we are here today, still talking about failures in this My Health Record system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably the most fundamental problem with this My Health Record that is being proposed by the governmentâand I say this as someone who has participated in the Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the recordârelates to the fact that the system that was originally put in place by Labor when we were last in government, the My Health Record that we created, was an opt-in system. People made an active choice as to whether they wanted to get a My Health Record, which would then consolidate all their health notes and the records of their treatments into one place for health practitioners to use. But obviously in an opt-in system those people who don't want to do that, for whatever reason, aren't forced to have a health record. The problem we have now is that the system the government is putting forward seeks to change from an opt-in system to an opt-out system. Unless people make an active choice that they don't want a health record, they will automatically get one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't necessarily have a problem with moving to an opt-out system, provided that people are made fully aware of their rights, the pros and cons, and a range of other things. I do have a problem with moving, as this government proposes to do, to an opt-out system built on the foundations that underpin an opt-in system. That might sound like jargon, but to really simplify it: the point of having an opt-in system is that a patientâor any Australian citizen who opts inâis making an informed decision about putting their data online and making it available to a range of people, whether it be their health practitioners or other people. They've actually decided that they want to make that information available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've discovered through the processes of the inquiry that under an opt-in system, the way the government was first proposing it, not only was that information being provided and made available to health practitioners but also there were a range of other people who would have access to that dataâin some situations employers or employer nominated doctors and in some situations people's former partners, even if it was a woman who was escaping domestic violence. In the old system, where someone opted in, they had control over who would have access to their information, because they were making an informed decision to make that information available to health practitioners and all the other people who would have access to that system. If they didn't like itâif they didn't want to make that information availableâthey didn't have to opt in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've now got under this government is an opt-out system where, unless you take an active step to opt out of the system, your health information will be made available to the same range of peopleâhealth practitioners, employer nominated doctorsâwith the risk of that information being passed on to employers or former partners, even those in a domestic violence situation. So you simply cannot build an opt-out system, as the government proposes to do, on the same foundations that underpin an opt-in system. With what the government is proposing, someone does not exercise informed consent in having a My Health Record created for them. It's happening for them whether they like it or not, whether they know about it or not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the work we undertook in the Senate inquiry, Labor and the Greens put forward a range of amendments that we wanted to see put in place by the government, to tighten some of these risks around privacy and access to information. As other Labor senators have mentioned, when we set up this Senate inquiry Minister Hunt accused us of engaging in a stunt. Well, it was so much of a stunt that he has now accepted almost all of the recommendations of that inquiry. So, clearly, we were on the right track in saying that there were real problems with this My Health Record, an opt-out system that needed to be fixed via this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember that when the opt-out period began, in July, there was an absolute firestorm of controversy as the media, stakeholders and the general public raised concerns that the government's system was not up to scratch. We were told by the government that everything was fine, that there was 'nothing to see here' and that it would all be okay. But that wasn't the response Australians were providing. They were clearly worried about what was being done here, with the lack of information being provided. At the time, we did get the government to make some amendments, which initially they had said weren't needed. They were things like tightening access for law enforcement agencies so that law enforcement agencies could only get access to My Health Record data using a warrant. The government also agreed to amend the system to enable the permanent deletion of records, something they had initially resisted as well. I'll give the government credit for acknowledging the need for those changes and making those amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as the Senate inquiry revealed, there were a range of other problems with the system despite the government's insistence that everything was fine. It's lucky we did get that inquiry up, because it did expose, by having witnesses come into the inquiry and give evidence, a range of other deficiencies with the government's approach that needed to be fixed. That's what led us as Labor senators to propose six further amendments to introduce tougher penalties for breaches of the actâdata breachesâto address concerns around access to My Health Record data from former partners, even when a relationship has broken down following domestic violence. That amendment has now been picked up by the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate inquiry also revealed some very worrying evidence about the ability of employer nominated doctors to get access to health data. If someone is injured at work and sent off to have a medical assessment performed by an employer nominated doctor or a WorkCover nominated doctor, it was revealed through the inquiry, there were inadequate safeguards to prevent that information filtering back to an employer who might then decide to use it as a reason to either get rid of an employee altogether or discriminate against them in some way. As a result of that evidence, we made a recommendation that the legislation be amended to prevent that kind of employer access, and I'm pleased the government has picked that up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other really big concerns that emerged in the inquiry was the risk that at some future point the record could be privatised. We know this government has a tendency to privatise social services. We're seeing it happen right now in Medicare, in Centrelink offices, with the increased outsourcing of work to the private sector. So it's quite understandable that many Australians would have a concern that this government, if it were returned, might look to privatise, or in some way make money out of, a very valuable resource: a record of all Australians' health information. You could imagine there'd be a lot of drug companies, a lot of private health insurers and a lot of other people out there who'd be very keen to get access to that data and make money out of it, and there was nothing in this legislation, as it was originally proposed by the government, that would have stopped the government from deciding to privatise it or commercialise it in the future. So, again, I'm pleased that the government have listened and have picked up our recommendation that the legislation be amended to prevent that from occurring. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it's good that they've finally listened about the need for those amendments, despite their original claims that everything was going to be fine and the legislation was perfect as it currently stood. But we still maintain that the Australian public's concern about My Health Record is so deep that the government really must further extend the opt-out period, and that's why we're going to be moving an amendment to the government's bill to insert a 12-month delay in the expiration of that opt-out period. The fact that, according to newspaper reports, systems are melting down today as floods of Australians attempt to opt out of this system shows that there are still very great concerns among a large portion of the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm confident that most Australians would be convinced that this is a good thing to do if there were a proper information campaign run by a government that doesn't have a record of technological failureâthings like the NBN, the census fail, the robo-debts and every other failure from this government in technologyâand that is able to roll out technology effectively and properly communicate to people the pros and cons of having a My Health Record, in particular the benefits to patients of having all of that data consolidated and available to any health practitioner no matter where they're being treated. But I'm not confident that that can occur with the opt-out period about to close tomorrow, when we've had such a pathetic information campaign and such a pathetic rollout by this government. Clearly, if this system is to work properly and is to give patients and taxpayers the benefits that an e-health record can provide then people need more time to think through the arguments, to understand the benefits, to understand the risks and to understand what's being done to minimise those risks through some of the amendments that the government has picked up. Twelve months more time would allow people to make the kind of informed decision that they need to make to have a health record provided for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice that it's not only Labor and other senators who are calling for a 12-month extension. I see that the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, one of Australia's peak health groups, is supporting our call for an extension to the opt-out period. A 12-month extension would give the government time to commission and implement a Privacy Commissioner review to address outstanding concerns about the settings that underpin My Health Record. As I said, Labor has always supported a move to an e-health record. We were the ones who brought it in when we were last in government, but that was a very different system to what is provided for by this government. Australians need more time to get access to information about this record so we can harness its benefits in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  The My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018 represents an opportunity to address some obvious flaws with the current My Health Records Act. Many of us here in the chamber have, for a long time, held concerns about the pace of the rollout of the opt-out system and what seems like a dismissive approach to valid privacy and security concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My Health Record started life as an opt-in, personally-controlled health record system, so it's perhaps unsurprising that it's had such a rocky journey towards a national opt-out system. I'm glad that the government has finally sought to amend two of the more glaring problems in the act that were undermining trust in the system. Under this bill, cancelled records will actually be cancelled and not simply deactivated and put on file somewhere for 30 years after the person's death. Common sense has very much prevailed here because to do otherwise would be very much unnecessary, even ridiculous, and would mean that if you had cancelled your record it still existed and, in the worst-case scenario, could still be accessed by hackers in the event of a security breach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also require enforcement agencies such as the police and the immigration department to require a court order before they can access an individual's My Health Record. Previously, they could literally just knock on the door and ask the system operator for them, and all the Australian Digital Health Agency had to do was reasonably believe that it was necessary to hand them over. How's that for due process? How's that for privacy? Somehow it was decided that this should be permitted, even at the risk that it might dissuade some people from taking out a My Health Record, not necessarily out of fear but perhaps more out of an abundance of caution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from estimates that Tasmania Police have made one request to access a person's record, but that person didn't have a record so it became a moot point. We have no information on what would have been deemed a reasonable belief. This bill seeks to patch up that lax and subjective approach to oversight by requiring enforcement agencies to obtain a court order first, but we think this is closing the door after the horse has bolted. I can see why government would be keen to allow enforcement access to this massive database as a last resort, but we contend that it is an inappropriate use of the system. I'd like to remind everyone that the original intent of the My Health Record system was to improve people's management of their personal health and, in particular, to improve the delivery of health care for patients with chronic and complicated conditions. As a database, it should only be used for public health benefits. To open this database to designated entities, such as the police and the immigration department, for non-health related purposes is very much mission creep. That is why we have proposed an amendment to remove enforcement access to My Health Record, even under warrant, unless it relates to fraud or misuse of the My Health Record itself. We think this is a sensible balance that better protects people's privacy and protects the integrity of the system. The type of information available through My Health Record would be available through other means at the government's disposal, such as Medicare, for example. No-one can give us even a hypothetical circumstance under which the record would be needed by enforcement agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the other amendments before us, we agree that the opt-out period needs to be extended well past tomorrow to give people more opportunity to be informed about the record and to take action if they don't want it. However, there does seem to be disagreement between the parties as to how long this should be, in terms of weeks or months. We've been lobbied on four weeks and up to 12 months. We don't believe that four weeks is long enough to allow the changes in this bill and continued public education to filter through, but we also think that there is momentum now that we should build on and that 12 months is too long a period. Centre Alliance is happy to accept the government's amendments, which address many of the concerns that were raised during the references inquiry and which other parties would have moved on if the government hadn't.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We absolutely agree that there should be no access to the records for employers or insurers. Private health records should have no bearing on the decision to employ someone or to insure them. We also support the proposal to remove access for parents who are under a supervision order, apprehended violence order or otherwise pose a risk to the health and safety of a child or authorised carer. We accept the evidence provided by the health professionals during the recent references inquiry that we need to give teenagers more control over their record. While PBS data will not be visible in a child's My Health Record after the age of 14, other sensitive information, such as pathology reports, will be visible unless the teenager takes control of their record, so we accept the Greens' amendment which serves to prevent parents accessing the record of their child after the age of 14 without their written consent. After all this, we will have a vastly improved system, though still nowhere near perfect.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that none of this does enough for me personally to persuade me to sign up, so I have opted out. I'm not at all convinced that the system will be as secure and seamless as the government and the ADHA assures us it will be. We know that health records are a major target for hackers, here and overseas. We also know from media reports and the Community Affairs References Committee inquiry on My Health Record that security experts have expressed concerns at the centralised nature of the database. Your health data is incredibly private and intimate. Even if you feel you have nothing to hide, it is the last thing you want in the hands of the police, in the hands of hackers, or out of your hands at all. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate on the My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018. It is of importance to so many people. Just to describe the reality: so many Australians get on and live their lives in complete blissful ignorance of what we do here, in either the green chamber or the red chamber. But those who paid attention at school understand that the red chamber is the house of review, where we get to look at whatever legislation comes through and do this process of amendment that many Australians don't understand. Basically, it's the second chance you get to have a look at what the legislation's doing. If it's doing something really bad, there are a couple of things we can do. We can have an inquiry, where we get experts from around Australia to talk to us, and we can also make amendments. That's what we're trying to do here today. We're doing it in a way that reflects, sadly, the chaos of this government, which has been completely focused on itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were here a couple of weeks ago. If this government had any control over what they were doing and weren't so obsessed with the infighting that's become the hallmark of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, we wouldn't be doing this at the last minute. But here we are, literally at the last minute, in the Australian federal parliament, in the Senate, trying to protect 17 million Australians from this government's failure to carefully look at legislation that they brought in here, that they said was going to be fine and wouldn't have any problems. But those of us here today in the chamberâon behalf of the Australians who are out there at work, looking after their families, working in their community and getting on with their lifeâare witnessing what an opposition does, certainly what a Labor opposition does, in trying to prevent the worst excesses of what this government is trying to inflict on Australians as of tomorrow night. That's how 'last minute' we are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should we be concerned about this government when it has anything to do with technology? Let's look at a few of their failed technologies that are experienced by too many Australians. Let's look at the rollout of the NBN, which was supposed to be a brand new technology. It's absolutely vital to the economic wellbeing of the country. There was an opportunity, through Labor, to roll it out into regional areas and build the economy. They stuffed it. Instead of giving us a fibre network for the 21st century, they opted for a copper network from the last century. I'm sure that you, like me, have had your problems in dealing with the NBN to try and maintain access. Businesses across the country have had terrible troubles. That's the litany of problems that we see with this government. They don't seem to understand technology. They're not up with the 21st century. You can see it just by looking at them. There are so many blokes; there are hardly any women there. They're behind the times, and they're behind the times on this legislation. We're doing this last-minute effort to try and save 17 million Australians from having this government's flawed legislation impact our lives. That's what we're doing right now. We're going to vote on it pretty soon, probably. The Labor Party is very clear about our role in opposition in terms of protecting the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've failed on a whole lot of other fronts. The rollout of the NDIS is a debacle. Do you remember the census? 'Everything will be fine,' they said. They privatised a little bit here and a little bit there and said, 'It will all be fine'. Come census night, it crashed. What's going on right now is that Australiansâthe ones who are listening, the ones who aren't too busy actually living their lives, who believe that this government is looking after themâdon't know what's going to happen tomorrow night; they don't know what it's going to do. So people who are just waking up to the fact that this is going to impact their lives have decided that they're going to opt out. And the system's crashing as we speak, with 17 million people never going to be able to be accommodated by that system in the next 24 hours. That's an impossibility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government were to come anywhere near looking at the truth of the situation that we're in, they would not be continuing to push for this legislation in the form that they've advanced it. They would make the change. They would grant what you just heard Senator Watt speaking aboutâthe 12-month extension that we are seeking. They would responsibly do that. Instead, we've got them pushing for this to be cleaned up by tomorrow night because they don't want everybody to see this mess continue. They just want to put it aside and then they can focus on their internal troubles again. Well, it's not good enough for Australia. It's not good enough for all Australians, and it's certainly not good enough for the 17 million who, as of tomorrow night, will have a permanent health record if this government get their way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How did we get to this spot? This is one of the things that surprises me about this government, and I'm sure it would surprise you too: when you put legislation forward, it's a good idea that you check with people. This legislation really did start quite some time ago, in terms of a personally controlled electronic health record under Labor. We actually think it's a good idea that, if you're travelling around the country or overseas, you've got all your documents in one place and they're accessible to you. But we believe, unlike the government, that you should be in control of that information and who can see it, just like when you talk to your doctor. Getting health care relies on a therapeutic relationship of trust. Your personal information is of value to you and your doctor. It should be controlled by you and your doctor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was originally proposed by this government was legislation that didn't make enough of a change from an opt-in system to when they decided, 'Let's just get the job done and we'll make it opt out and everybody will just have to put up with it.' That's the arrogance and the hubris that we see from this government continually. First of all, they said, 'Everything's fineâdon't worry about it; there's nothing to see here.' Labor said: 'There's no way that this is okay. We've got to have an inquiry into this.' The Senate needed to do one of those things that I said it has the power to doâto have an inquiry and get the experts in, because we know the government hadn't spoken to them. The experts came on, and we've had a number of recommendations. Along the way, the government have, with resistance, finally come to a couple of amendments, because even they, in their arrogance and hubris, in their ignorance of the reality, had to acknowledge some of the experts and make a couple of changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor thinks there are a lot more changes that need to be made. That's why Senator Polley, in her speech this morning, foreshadowed six significant amendments that Labor will be advancing. They're very, very important. We know that one of the concerns that has been raised is that there could be a breach of the act. Somebody who might think that your information is valuable to them, even though it's the law, might break the law. So one of the things we're recommending is that, for a breach of the act, there should be tougher penalties. We have to provide a great offence for those who are actually going to be caught up in this system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Watt, in his recent contributionâand I acknowledge Senator Griff mentioned this as wellâsaid that we've recommended changes to address the concerns around domestic violence and employer access. Happily, I haven't had this personal experience, but people who flee domestic violence do so at incredible risk in a very vulnerable period of their life. It's not surprising that they might have to visit doctors and get support for themselves and their children in such a situation. There are insufficient protections in this bill, as advanced by the government, to ensure that a perpetrator of domestic violence is unable to track down a family that has fled from a violent situation. That's a problem; that's one of the problems. Even if that were the only problem, you'd think the government would wake up and say, 'We'd better slow down on this; we'd better fix it up.' But no: they want to press ahead regardless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue we think needs to be addressedâconcerns that have been raised with the committeeârelates to employer access. I have to say that I feel pretty fortunate that, in the work I've done, I would not be concerned, for the most part, that my employer would have accessed my My Health Record documents. But I can tell you as the shadow assistant minister for mental health to Julie Collins from the other place, the member for Franklin, that there are lots of concerns about mental health records and the way in which they are used. They've been raised over and over again. In a recent inquiry that we had into the insurance industry we had testimony, day after day, from people who were denied insurance. One woman was denied insurance for 20 years because she had a period of postnatal depression. For 20 years she couldn't get insurance because of that single incident in her lifeâhow appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health records impact very significantly on peoples' access to insurance, and unscrupulous people will access these records. We don't have sufficient protection from this government to make sure that employer access is absolutely denied. There are many situations you could think of. Would a young woman looking for work really want her employer to be able to find out whether she was using contraception or not? Is it really within your employer's rights to find out that at age 12 there was a short period during which you had an eating disorder? Is that really within your employer's rights? If I asked youâman, woman or childâyou would say, 'No; that is a matter for me and my practitioner.' What we're seeing at the moment from the legislative agenda of this government is a failure to adequately deal with that level of protection that I think is a fair thing for ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also are still very concerned that this government, which moves to privatise everythingâor a future government with the same kind of attitudeâcould find a way to sell off information. It's wrong on every single level; it is an intolerable position. But there is not adequate protection in the legislation that this government has brought forward. I bet that the day they should have been looking at that they were doing something elseâmaybe having a few discussions in the corridors and on phones to one another, talking about taking out Mr Turnbull and putting in Mr Morrison. That's what they do. That's what they've been doing. There is no excuse for legislation with so many failure points to be advanced into this Senate chamber, except that they have stopped paying attention to the job they're supposed to be doing as a government and instead have gone on a flight of fancy of their own making. They've decided that they're just going to have warfare inside and have forgotten to do the job they're employed to do here for the Australian people, which is to advance careful, considered legislation that is full of insight as a result of careful consultation with experts across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also very concerned that insurers should not have access to this information. I'm sure you share that concern with me. Like you, I'm sure, I don't watch much television; I have a very full life and I choose most of the time to read, talk to family, go for a walk, play some music or something like that, rather than watch television. But in the little bits of time that I've been watching television, just recently I've noticed, just as you might have noticed, a few TV ads that tell you something about this My Health Record. Why you didn't hear about it months and months and months and months ago is because the government didn't think you needed to know. The only reason that you have any advertising going on across our country right now about this issue that will affect 17 million Australians and that is going to be determined tomorrow night unless we can force the government backâthe only reason those ads have gone onto television is because the Labor Party here, on this side of the chamber in opposition, have made such a song and dance about it that they had to put some money into advertising. But 30 seconds or even a 60-second ad cannot tell you the detail of risk to the Australian population that I've been able to put on the record now for the 15 minutes I've been talking. I'm sure you're more aware about things now after 15 minutes than you would be after a 30-second ad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we've got. A little balloon has gone up to say to people: 'You're going to get a health record. It's going to be really good for you'. If I choose it, if I'm in control of it, if I'm confident that no-one else can look at it who might exploit me, then it would be a good thing, but that is not where we are. It's absolutely not where we are today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party is calling for the government to support all of the amendments that we have proposed. It's a difficult thing to fix legislation that is so flawed and ill-matched to what they've decided to do, to switch from an opt-in system to a 'You've got to choose to opt-out' system. That's where they made hair biggest mistake: they didn't recognise the scale of the difference that that made. Given the mess of the legislation, given the concerns that we still haveâand our amendments, if they get up, will be some form of protectionâwe think it's still not good enough and that there shouldn't be a deadline tomorrow for 17 million Australians who are just really starting to get a handle on what this government's about to do to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We say there should be a 12-month moratorium, a 12-month delay so a couple of things can happen, including, for starters, Australians getting more than 60 seconds of information about this. We think there should be a 12-month delay so that experts can continue to provide good counsel to a government that has ignored them for far too long. We think there needs to be a 12-month delay so the Privacy Commissioner, who's pretty good at his job regarding privacy, can look at what Australians need to have in place to be confident that our privacy is protectedâour privacy around health, critical, intimate information about you and I, about our kids, about grandparents. We need that privacy. Many of you probably don't even know that we've got a Privacy Commissioner, but we have, and this is exactly the kind of job that a privacy commissioner should undertake. It is their task to look at the impact of changesâparticularly legislative changesâthat might erode the current privacy that Australians have access to. That is really why we are seeking support of the crossbench today. There might be proposals around three months, six months or 12 months, but the government's still saying tomorrow night. So let's see what happens in the vote. Everybody's so confident that their best interests might be served by Independents; we'll see what the Independents do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many of the things that happen in this place, outside of this red chamber and the green chamber, which isn't sitting this week, Australians are getting on with their lives. The trust that Australians showed in electing the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Liberal National Party has been destroyed over and over again. Things that they promised, they have not delivered on. Things that they promised they wouldn't do, they have done. Today we can see a government that is not listening to the Australian people. It is completely out of touch. This legislation is just another example of the many failure points that we have seen in this chamber from this government that doesn't listen to experts, that denies scientific information, that doesn't understand new technology and what it can do, that doesn't have sufficient respect for the Australian people to provide adequate information and even the decency of a letter. None of us got a letter to say, 'You're going to have your privacy invaded and you're going to have a record whether you like it or not'. None of us got that letter. They didn't think they needed to do it. That's why this amendment and Labor's amendments should be supported here in this chamber today. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I rise also to place on record my concerns about the My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018 and to do so in the context of my broader concern about the government's approach to digital transformation generally. I will start with the bill. This is an incredibly important policy reform. Digital health records provide the opportunity for huge personal and community benefit by providing better information to clinicians and patients about their own medical history. But unfortunately the implementation of this concept has been badly bungled and the government seems unwilling to listen to the concerns of the community. Labor has called on the government to delay the opt-out deadline for the My Health Record, but the government continually refuses to meet that request. The Senate has voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling to delay the implementation of the My Health Record, but the government refuses to listen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it is a project that potentially offers huge benefit. In fact, it was initiated under the last Labor government. But the implementation has fallen woefully short of what's required for such a substantial transformation to the way that health record-keeping works. The key failure has been the decision to shift from an opt-in system to an opt-out system. Labor's approach was to say that people could opt in. Reasonable people can debate whether an opt-in or opt-out system would work better, but if you are going to choose to opt out it requires a very different approach to communicating about the scheme. By shifting from Labor's original opt-in system to an opt-out system, the government has placed the entire project at risk. The Senate has expressed its concerns about the implementation of this schemeâand, frankly, so have the Australian people. The government has not implemented the necessary legislative reforms to secure these arrangements in a way that is satisfactory for the Australian people, and it has not communicated the benefits of the My Health Record to the Australian people. As a consequence, people do not understand the privacy protections that are available to them and do not have confidence in the adequacy of these protections. There is enormous distrust in the system. That's why we've called for the 12-month extension. It's actually a reasonable solution. It's a solution that a smart government would pick up because it would provide the opportunity to fix this mess. It would provide an opportunity to legislate for appropriate privacy protections and to talk about this with the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Privacy Commissioner should be involved in a review to address outstanding concerns about the system settings. In undertaking such a review, the Privacy Commissioner should consider the appropriate balance between utility for clinicians, patients and other carers and the privacy and security of individuals. The Privacy Commissioner, in undertaking such a review, could grapple with the difficulty of ensuring genuinely informed consent. Such a review could make appropriate changes to default access settings, which become necessary once you move to an opt-out model. It would also provide the opportunity to work through the very significant issues for particular cohorts of vulnerable peopleâI'm thinking here about young people, people aged 14 to 17 and families fleeing domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time would provide so much for making this project work. Time would allow all of these things to be addressed properly and it would allow confidence to be restored. But, stubbornly, the government persists with its present timetable. The opt-out is due to finish this week. Seventeen million Australians will have their records created, and there will not have been adequate consideration of privacy concerns or an adequate response communicated to the Australian public about the concerns that have been expressed by so many. And these questions of confidence are huge. We are moving into a period where technology will play a significantly greater role in the delivery of government services. I'm all for thatâin fact, I'm very interested in it because I think it presents an opportunity for government services to be provided at a higher level of quality and with a great deal more accessibility. But you have to proceed in a way that gives confidence. It's a new thing for people to transact business online. It's not always straightforward, and anyone who has tried to navigate some of the existing government systems knows that finding your way through the new world of security arrangements, passwords, different pages and provision of identification is very complicated. It also raises a range of issuesâacutely in the case of healthâabout what information is being provided and who will have access to it. For all those reasons, you need to take the community into your trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parliament, we need to give confidence to the community that the arrangements we're putting in place meet the very reasonable expectation that the community has that their information is protected. But unfortunately it's hard to get the community to trust when there is such a history of maladministration when it comes to tech projects for this government. Even this year we've seen a litany of problems. The plug was pulled earlier this year on a multimillion-dollar apprenticeship management system that was developed for the Department of Education and Training. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission's biometrics project, which was touted as a very significant initiative and overseen by the current digital transformation minister, has also been canned. There have been major problems with this year's NAPLAN tests. Perhaps the worst in this list of disasters: staff have been told to abandon work on the $100 million project to overhaul the child support payment system. Why is this happening? There has been a complete failure over the last five years of this government to invest any political capital whatsoever into overseeing, supporting and championing digital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are difficult transformations to make and they require leadership, but there has been a constant churn of ministers. We don't have anyone who has taken leadership and provided sustained leadership over the period of time that the government has been in power. In the case of the Digital Transformation Agency, I think we have now had five CEOs. I think we're up to our fifth CEO with Mr Brugeaud. The last one left after just 16 months. That, in turn, has produced a complete inability to retain staff. This is something that I have been paying attention to. The DTA, in its three years of existence, has seen 340 staff leave, and that was just in an 18-month period from December 2016 to June 2018. The place only has a total workforce of 342 people, so that's a 100 per cent turnover of staff. How can any project be delivered with any consistency, any continuity or any quality when people keep leaving? As my colleague Senator Kitching jokedâand it's not really a jokeâthey must be having a morning tea pretty much once a day, with 342 people leaving. That's a lot of cake! Actually, it's really not a laughing matter; it's a serious problem. It shows up in tech disaster after tech disaster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing I wanted to point to in closing is that these failures are expensive. Presumably, they're frustrating for the personnel who work on them, and, potentially, they're also a very big problem for service delivery and full confidence. Digital transformation presents the most enormous opportunity for government. People expect excellent digital services when they go to the bank and people expect excellent digital services when they engage with their super company. They expect excellent digital services when they go looking for some retail experiences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe in an excellent Public Service. The Australian Public Service should provide excellent services to all Australiansâthe best services we can possibly provideâand that means going digital. But we can't sort that out until we provide leadership. That means stable leadership at a ministerial level and it means stable executive leadership within the Public Service. Until those things are sorted out, we'll continue to see falling confidence in public services delivered digitally. That's a great shame, because in the area of health, in particular, there is the potential for huge rewardsâtransformative rewards for patients and significantly greater productivity for clinicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we shouldn't miss out on thatâit's a huge opportunityâit requires trust and confidence. We call on the government again to extend the opt-out period, to slow this down and to return to a position where the community can have confidence in the project as described.</span>

Senator O'Neill actually went into the detail and was speaking to the gallery, almost trying to persuade those there. She asked them the questions: 'Is it within your employer's right to know if you're taking contraceptives? Is it your employer's right to know if you had an eating disorder when you were 12 years old?' Wow! Deb O'Neill is the only one who has asked that question and I don't even know why that question was asked! Well, of course it's not! It has never happened, nor should it ever happen. Any suggestion that it has happened in the past or that the circumstance exists where it could happen in the future is a pretty low blow in this place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go on. Apparently, this is all a complete flight of fancy. We had a Senate inquiry. It had three coalition members, four Labor members and two members of the Greens, and other senators had a participating role. The government has listened very carefully. You'd think, from what Senator O'Neill said, that the only reason the government is making any amendments is because of her and that the only reason the government has invested in the extensive education campaign that you've all been listening to is because it was her idea! Well, thanks, Deb! Perhaps she should have a chat to voters in the electorate of Robertson, who were so impressed with her that they threw her out. That's why she's in the Senate.</span>

We're here with government amendments that we've considered as part of the committee process, as part of the consultancy with the wider Australian people. I think, in the broad, there's broad agreement that there be amendments. There is concern with some elementsâthe opt-in/opt-out element. As many of you would be aware, this parliament in this place in 2015 universally supported legislation that supported the opt-out approach. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the My Health Record system remains unchanged. It is to help overcome the fragmentation of health information by allowing a person to more easily access their own health information and to make it securely accessible to healthcare providers involved in their care. My Health Record is an important piece of our national health infrastructure, and it is changing the nature of health care in Australia for the better. The benefits of a safe and secure system are significant for all Australians through avoided hospital admissions, fewer adverse drug events, reduced duplication of tests, better coordination of care for people seeing multiple healthcare providers, and better informed treatment decisions. More than six million Australians already experience the benefits, with access to important health information when and where it's needed so that the right treatment can be delivered faster and more safely. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent months, concerns have been raised about elements of the My Health Record system, including as part of two Senate inquiries. We've listened, and this bill, as I indicated earlier, addresses those concerns. The bill will strengthen the privacy protections for the My Health Record system to remove any doubt as to how seriously the Australian government takes the security of health information. The protections enshrined in this bill are some of the strongest in the Commonwealth. The key measure proposed by this bill will restrict the circumstances in which My Health Record information can be disclosed. We will apply significantly increased penalties for the misuse of My Health Records and the system. We will require that, if anyone decides to cancel their My Health Record, the system operator destroy all of the health information it holds forever for that person. </span>

We will ensure that if a person has restricted access to their child, or could pose a risk to the child or someone associated with a child, they will not be able to get access to the child's My Health Record.

The very open default access setting and the automatic uploading of two years of Medicare PBS data communicate these additional protections to all Australians to rebuild the trust and confidence in My Health Record. Of course, any extension is an improvement on what the government was offering this morning, but it is imperative that we get this right.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  The Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments. We need to be really clear about what's happening here, and this is a highly technical area and it's confusing a lot of people. The bottom line is that, without these amendments, the opt-out period closes tomorrow. What that means is that every Australian who does not take an active step to opt out will have a medical record created for them. What that means, as Senator Polley has just indicated, is that a whole lot of PBS and MBS data will be uploaded and, from that point on, medical information will be recorded in the My Health Record. For many Australians, that's happening without their knowledge. We asked, through the Senate inquiry, about the number of people who were aware of My Health Record being created for them, and a very significant proportion of Australiansâoff the top of my head, close to 40 per cent of Australiansâhad no knowledge that a record was going to be created for them. That's a very serious issue when you consider the change that's taking place here. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, let's try to bring a bit of bipartisanship or tripartisanship to this debate. We all agree that there is a need to try to ensure that My Health Record proceeds. But it has to be done carefully. It has to be done in a way that acknowledges that there have been some major stumbles along the way, and that has undermined public confidence. What we're suggesting here is that we give another year for people to understand a little bit more about the system, where any further problems that are identified are acknowledged and dealt with before everybody has a medical record created. Let's not forget that we were given assurances in the lead-up to these government amendments that nothing needed to be done. We were given assurances that, for example, law enforcement officials couldn't access medical records without a warrant, and then we found that that's not actually the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's a prudent approach, a cautious approachâindeed, some might say it's a conservative approachâto extend the opt-out period for another year in order for us to ensure that people understand what's happening and can implement the appropriate privacy settings that they feel comfortable with rather than the default creation, particularly given that this legislation won't have even passed both houses of parliament and a new record will have been created. We can't say with absolute certainty that the changes that the government acknowledges need to happen will indeed pass both houses of parliament. Yet we're being told that this should occur tomorrow, that the opt-out period should end. We don't think it's prudent, and we think it potentially undermines people's confidence in what is a very important reform but one that should be proceeded with with caution and where we have an opportunity to identify any further issues that might arise over the next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we will be supporting these amendments, and we think the government should think long and hard about whether it wants to press ahead and potentially undermine what's a very important change in Australian health care.</span>

I commend the last speaker, the leader of the Greens. At least the multipartisan approach is the right approach to this, not some of the approaches we have in this place. There have been concerns that, by delaying this 12 months, the process of the opt-in and then the cancellation will leave somebody high and dry. Let's just deal with that element of it. Whatever date you pickâlet's say it's in a year's timeâthere is going to have to be a translation from where you can opt out physically and how a record is created. Just for clarity: up until tomorrow, there will be an opt-out process. There has been an opt-out process for four months. The opt-out process, as I indicated, had unanimous support here in 2015. I'm not saying the circumstances were identical, but that was the case. After whatever time on Thursday it is that you can no longer opt out, you can still cancel. Between that date and whatever date the finalisation of the records is, which is about mid-December, the fact that you have cancelled means that no record would be created. No record would be created until that date. So even if you haven't opted out and there is a record created, at any time after that absolute moment that you have a record created you can cancel and the record will be completely expunged. That's just for clarity around this transformation. I think people should rightly have concern about what happens during this period: 'Can we opt out or opt in?' There's an opt-out period. After that opt-out period, there is a period between tomorrow and mid-December under which there has to be a reconciliation of records and the record is created. At any time, if you say, 'I wish to cancel my record,' no record would be created. If it's post that date and you cancel your record, that record could would be cancelled and expunged. That's just for clarity. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some issues around the privacy settings. This is being considered concurrently. I take the point made by the leader of the Greens: we need to ensure that we don't pass part of this legislation and still not have the privacy provisions providing that protection. That's why we are considering those matters concurrently. We believe that these privacy settings are the right settings. The Privacy Commissioner oversees the Digital Health Agency. It's also his role specifically now, as Privacy Commissioner, to oversee those processes. We think there has been sufficient work done not to delay for a 12-month period, and we won't be supporting the amendment. </span>

It won't happen automatically. There will be a period of time over which those records will be created. It might take a month or two. But that's not the point. Again, I will put my own personal view on this very clearly. I have worked as a medical practitioner and I understand the benefits of coordinating this information in a way that you can access people's medication record so that you do not prescribe a medication where you might have a drug interaction and cause a complication. I understand all of that and come at it from the perspective of wanting this to work. My concernâand it's a really serious concernâis that, having seen this rollout over a period of months, there have been a range of very significant problems associated with the rollout. We've had conflicting information. We're here trying to address a number of the concerns that were raised in the Senate inquiry process because these issues have been identified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talk to my colleagues in the medical community, many of them have chosen to opt out. When you've getting doctors choosing to opt out, that says something to meânot to mention to the many members of the Australian community who know about this and are concerned enough to opt out. The fact that so many records are anticipated to be created is more a function of people not knowing the deadlines and understanding that this process is underway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is we're at a point that has the potential to derail this. We may end up with no health record if we proceed in the way that we are. We have a year to roll out this reform with a thorough and exhaustive education campaign. People need to understand the settings they have control over and be given the information they need to adjust those settings, rather than simply ending up with a whole lot of records created by default. People who haven't been following this closelyâand it is a very technical debateâcould find they have a record created that they don't want created. They could find themselves in a situation with complexities, that can't be anticipated, emerging as a result of the rush to have everybody on an electronic health record by default. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept your point that not everyone will have a record created from tomorrow and that it may be a month or two away, and that people will have the opportunity to go in and delete their record. It will be a permanent deletion, thanks to an amendment we proposed that the government has adopted. But that's likely to be after the fact, after something's occurred that has created a problem for someone, and will, potentially, undermine confidence in the system. That's what we need to avoid if this reform is to be a success. I just think it's prudent. That's why we will support this amendment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments extend the time in which people can actually opt out of My Health Recordâto end on 31 January 2019. A lot of people feel that they haven't had enough information with regards to the My Health Record, and the government was going to have the op-out period close tomorrow. These amendments give the public more time to understand My Health Record and what it means to them, which I think is very important. Allowing this extra time, until 31 January, will give the public a better understanding of it. My understanding now is that the computer system to opt out has crashed, so it's not fair on the public unless we give them an extension of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it's very important that the people know what My Health Record means to them. There's been a lot of fear about privacyâthat people will access their records. My understanding is that a person would have total control of their record at all times. Although One Nation is putting forward an extension of the opt-out period until 31 January next year, people can opt out of the My Health Record system at any time after that. The public are not committed to stay in this; they can opt out at any time. It is not retrospective and cannot capture historical information unless uploaded by an individual or by an individual's own healthcare provider at their request. The individual will also be able to log onto their own record at any time and see who has accessed that record. They can nominate who cannot access it and they can request the destruction of their record at any time. I believe that the penalties associated with thisâif anyone does disclose anyone else's health recordâinclude a fine for an individual of $63,000 and up to five years imprisonment or, for a corporation, $315,000. If it is a civil offence, it will be a $315,000 fine for an individual and over $1Â½ million for a corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My Health Record is going to be very good, and, to put on the record, I'm not going to opt out of it; I'm going to be part of it. It's going to be very good for the Australian people, because a lot of people now travel around. There are the grey nomads travelling around the country, and their records can be accessed by hospitals and doctors if they need to know what their health situation is. In general, it's going to be very good for the public. So I hope that these amendments do get support from this house to allow the extension of time so that the public are better informed about it and can understand what it means to them. I hope my amendments to extend it out to 31 January 2019 are supported by this house.</span>

We do feel that 12 months is the preferred length of time to manage trust and security issues and so that the Australian people fully understand. In light of the fact that our amendment was not supported, we will be supporting these amendments because any extension of time is very valuable for the Australian community.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  Obviously I voted for the 12-month extension with the ALP and the Greens, but I will be voting for Senator Hanson's extension because anything's better than nothing. I think it gives people an extra eight, nine, 10 weeks to opt out. I've opted in, and I support the My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) BillâI guess my health records are public anyway! On this one, I will be voting for it. It's a good idea to push it back to the end of January, and I hope it gets the support of all the house.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I put on the record that groupthink is not endemic in this place. I'm opposed to extending this. I think the Australian people have had plenty of time to opt out and get their house in order and that extending it for another week, two weeks or two months is not going to make any difference to those people who haven't bothered to acquaint themselves with the circumstances. I also make the point that, should they wish to do so after My Health Record is implemented, they could delete their record of their own accord. Notwithstanding this, I understand the numbers are certainly there for this. I won't call a division on it, but I want to put on the record that I just don't see these delays as being necessary. But politics is what it is and the numbers will rule.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an amendment that says that, if you're aged 14 to 17, you have control over who accesses your medical record. This is a piece of legislation that makes it very clear that the concerns of young people and groups that represent young peopleâindeed, medical practitioners who treat young peopleâare respected. Perhaps it might be worthwhile to explain the current situation. If you're a medical practitioner, someone who is aged between 14 and 17 may come to your practice. It might be a young woman seeking medical contraception. It might be a young person with a mental illness and a history of drug use wanting to seek treatment from a medical practitioner. It might be somebody with a sexually transmitted disease. It might be in a clinic that specialises in treating those sorts of issues in young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, should a parent wish to access that information, they will call the doctor and request the medical history of their son or daughter, and the doctor can make a judgement. The doctor can say: 'This person, in my view, is a competent minor. They are able to make this decision for themselves at the age of 17.' If they want to take contraception and they don't want that information to be disclosed to their parent, that is absolutely their right to do that, and the parent doesn't have the right to access that information. Under this change, if automatic right is granted to a parent then that step of actually contacting the doctor and seeking to gain permission to access that information changes significantly and what happens is a parent can simply jump online and look at the medical history of their son or daughter. They can see that they've received treatment for, for example, drug addiction. Their child might be somebody who has been through a detox program. They might be somebody who is receiving contraception or, indeed, treatment for a sexually transmitted disease. You can get that information if you know what you're looking for simply by the PBS recordâsimply by the drugs that have been prescribed. This is a pretty significant step and it reduces the autonomy of those young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the consequences of that is that young persons are less likely to want to seek that treatment and to have that conversation with a medical practitioner. It's a very important relationship and it's one where young people should feel that they are able to have confidence that a parent's not going to access that record. This is consistent with recommendation 2 in the Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into the My Health Record system. The College of General Practitioners, in their submission, made a similar request for this change. We've had concerns from, for example, headspace. Jason Trethowan, the CEO, expressed support for these amendments. They have broad support from people who work in this field and we think this is a very important change.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  Labor's ugly and opportunistic politics of division need to be outed. In recent times, we've seen Labor promote the politics of envy, jealousy and resentment of one Australian against their fellow Australian. It is the politics of division, the politics of class warfare and the politics of denigrating the virtues of hard work, self-reliance and delayed gratification. Virtues which have built our nation are being demonised by Labor in favour of the disingenuous and dishonest socialist dogma of an alleged equity, which in actual practice sees all people ultimately become equally poor. As Margaret Thatcher said, socialism always fails because they 'run out of other people's money'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To partially pay for Labor's extravagant policies, they are intent on ripping off hardworking Australians who have worked hard, seeking to be self-reliant and not be a burden on their fellow Australians. Today, I will deal with just two of Labor's five unfair tax policies conceived in the womb of envy. First is Labor's policy on negative gearing. Now, seriously, this is 'policy stupid' on steroids. To justify Labor's tax grab, they use all the rhetoric of division but no common sense. Negative gearing allows mortgage payments to be deducted against rental income by property owners. The practical impact of removing this deduction will, in fact, hit the poorest the hardest. Why is that? Because all the reports have indicated that, if you remove negative gearing, the household owner will make up for it by increasing rent, so it is the renters within our community who will actually pay the burden of Labor's tax grab. As we might think, it is mainly the renters within the community who are, in fact, on the lowest incomes. In my home state of Tasmania, it has been determined to be about $500 per annum extra that people renting their houses will need to pay to their landlords, courtesy of Labor's attempted tax grab.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have portrayed this as somehow being an unfair concession to the rich. That's the rhetoric, but, as I always want to do in these debates and in considering these matters, I ask: what are the facts? The facts are that in my home state of Tasmania, for example, in the electorate of Lyons, there are 3,000 negative gearers. In the electorate of Braddon, where the Liberal Party has just endorsed Gavin Pearceâan exceptionally good candidateâthere are 3,400 negative gearers. In the electorate of Bass, there are 3Â½ thousand negative gearers. And so the list goes on. Labor, having realised the stupidity of their policy, have sought to say that they will somehow grandfather it. Let's remember the actual numbers within the Australian community, because those who use negative gearing are neither rich nor the owners of multiple investment properties. Ratherâand these are very stunning statisticsâthey are made up of 58,000 teachers, 41,000 nurses, 52,000 retail workers, 19,000 police and emergency personnel, and tradies and small business people who put aside a bit of money each month to save for their future. About two-thirds of those who negative gear have a taxable income under $80,000 per annum. So much for Labor's dishonest portrayal that these are, allegedly, the rich people within the community. And 71 per cent have only one property, and 72 per cent use it for a tax deduction of less than $10,000 per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are approximately 1.3 million of our fellow Australians who negatively gear, and according to the Labor Party they are the filthy rich, who need to have their tax burden increased. No, they are 1.3 million of our fellow Australians who are willing to delay and defer income today for a better future for themselves tomorrow so they won't be reliant on their fellow Australians through the welfare system. They want to work hard and they want to save to ensure that they can be self-reliant and not a burden on their fellow Australians. These are virtues that we in the Liberal Party embrace; these are virtues that we in the Liberal Party want to ensure are continued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just briefly, the Australian Labor Party in fact got rid of negative gearing once. That worked out exceptionally well, didn't it? Within two years they had to reinstate it. Mr Swan, whilst he was Treasurer, told Melbourne radio, 'It would be economically disastrous to do anything on negative gearing.' Mr Swan was right then, and that statement remains right today. It is a matter of regret that the Australian Labor Party do not see that it is still the case today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, in the brief bit of time remaining to me, I turn to Labor's attempt to double-tax our pensioners and our self-funded retirees. Here we have another cohort of the Australian community that are not rich. In fact, it's 870,000 of our fellow Australians who will be impacted by Labor's tax grab, which seeks to double-tax them. With the dividend imputation that Labor wants to remove we have a situation where franking credits used by the shareholder are allowed to be offset against their tax obligation. In other words, it would be a tax refund. And who are the people who currently benefit from this? They are overwhelmingly low-income earners within the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, 870,000 of our fellow Australians will be worse off under Labor's proposed changes. More than half of all the people impacted by Labor's policy have a taxable income below $18,200. Hello, Mr Shorten? Hello, Labor Party? This is not a cohort of the filthy rich, as Labor would seek to portray them. Indeed, 96 per cent of all people who will be impacted have a taxable income below $87,000âhardly the filthy rich! And yet these are the people that the Australian Labor Party would seek to target, be it those who are currently employed or be they teachers, nurses or retail workers who want to save for the future and put a nest egg aside. As the Liberal Party and as the Liberal government, we say to them, 'If you want to have a go, we'll give you a fair go.' Labor's approach is, 'If you want to have a go, we'll tax you to ensure that you cannot get ahead.' We do support the aspirational, those who believe in the virtues of self-reliance, working hard and deferring lifestyle today until tomorrow to ensure that they can be self-reliant and not a burden on their fellow Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to my fellow Australians as we approach the next election: be exceptionally careful with what the Australian Labor Party will need to do to fund their extravagant policies. The funding of their extravagant policies will come out of your pockets, especially those of you who seek to look after yourselves. The Liberals will always give a fair go to those who seek to have a go.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Borroloola is a community almost 1,000 kilometres south-east of Darwin, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Borroloola is home to four language groups; to the Yanyuwa, the Garrwa, the Marra and the Gudanji peoples; and to all those non-Indigenous families and other First Nations people who've moved there. It is a very beautiful place in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This time last week families in Borroloola were called to a room in Borroloola School. They were called to that room in urgency by staff from special envoy Tony Abbott's office, by the Army and by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. They were called to that room and they were told in that meeting this time last week: 'Do you want houses here in Borroloola? Do you want houses? Because, if you do, we can bring down 12 houses to you. We can get them on a truck and we can send them down to you, but we need to know now because we want to get those houses down here straightaway.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell the Senate about the people of Borroloola. They have been waiting 10 years for $15 million from the federal government to provide housesâ10 years. In that time children, parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles have been living in extraordinarily overcrowded homesâ20 people to a house or a room. They had this offer come to them and they had to sign on the dotted line quickly, with no questions asked. Never mind that those houses are former Defence houses that have been sitting by the side of the road for four years. They were deemed unusable. There was no opportunity to really ask questions. Are these houses safe? Can these houses make the distance? Are they going to be permanent homes? Who's going to help with repairs and maintenance? Who is going to own them? Who's going to put them up? None of these questions were able to really be discussed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A month ago, special envoy Tony Abbott flew into Borroloola, and he was humiliated by the people there when they reminded him on two occasions that (a) they didn't know he was coming and (b) they don't have problems getting their kids to school. I understand that when some of the elders there said: 'Our biggest problem is housing. We've been waiting for 10 years and nothing has come,' he said, according to the elders there: 'Well, kids should be going to school. Even if they are living in caves, they should still be going to school.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This supposed offer that has come from the federal government has suddenly gone quiet. A week later, none of those families in Borroloola have heard anything. They don't know if those houses are still coming. They've had no-one communicate with them again. No-one has bothered to ring up or fly in to say: 'How are you going? Is this what you want?' There is dead silence, despite numerous attempts to find out what is going on from the Commonwealth government and from the missing-in-action Minister for Indigenous Affairs, who's doing nothing about housing in the Northern Territory, even though $550 million is there for the Northern Territory to sign up on with the federal government for future funding. None of that is happening.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the people who are most impoverished in our regions of the Northern Territory who are suffering at such an alarming rate, more so because of the appalling chaos of this government. Who's in charge? Is it the Indigenous affairs minister or is it the special envoy, Tony Abbott? Did he just come back to Canberra and then go into the Prime Minister's office and demand, 'I need millions of dollars to go back and see that 12 houses are taken down to the remote community of Borroloola?' Why? Not for the people of Borroloola. Maybe it's about fixing up the pride, the ego, the humiliation that Tony Abbott felt when he went into the community. This is not about respect. There is no dignity in any of this. This is not an engagement with First Nations people in a respectful manner. This is all about powerâthose who have it and making those without it feel degraded, despairing and hopeless. That's what you're doing when you show no respect whatsoever in a conversation that is absolutely vital to people who are homeless and living in absolutely Third World conditions. Lift your game. Who is in charge? Is it the special envoy, Tony Abbott? Is he now the Indigenous affairs minister who happens to have the ear of the Prime Minister and who can suddenly click his fingers and get these houses moved? Yet when Labor starts to ask questions and when the people in Borroloola start to ask questions, everything goes quiet. Nothing is happening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, Prime Minister and special envoy, what are you doing? How much are these houses going to cost? When are the long-term houses going to be built for the families of Borroloola, Garawa One Camp, Garawa Two Camp, Mara Camp, Yanyula Camp and the subdivision? When will you talk to the people of Borroloola in a respectful way so that they can define and determine what they want with the money that is rightfully theirs and has been theirs, sitting there and doing nothing? The ineptitude of the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, and now the meddling of the appointed special envoy, is continuing to cause chaos and neglect in First Nations communities. The Indigenous Advancement Strategy is treated as the minister's slush fund. We found out during estimates that he granted nearly $500,000 of IAS funding to three Northern Territory non-Indigenous industry peak bodies. Minister Scullion said that the funding was just for the legal fees, effectively, but we now know it is not. The Northern Territory Seafood Council has been very clear that they don't want to use their grant to pay legal coasts. The Cattlemen's Association wants to use some of theirs, as does the Amateur Fishermen's Association, to fund cross-cultural courses for their members. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as part of the land rights process these organisations have a right to argue detriment, and this is taken into account by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, but there is a process under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, section 54C, that provides for funding of legal representation in detriment cases. So why wasn't this process used? Why did the minister decide it was appropriate to use IAS funding money, which is meant for the expression, engagement and conservation of Indigenous culture, to fund detriment cases in land claims? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After I first raised this IAS funding issue, I received a message from a New South Wales woman, which I would like to share today with the Senate. She said: 'I am so disheartened by this because, as I read that story, I knew this was the same funding which had been cut from my daughter's primary school, Maclean Primary School in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. This school has at least 25 per cent Aboriginal students, the majority of which are Yaygirr. This is also the school I went to, as well as my mother. We are proud Yaygirr women, and for the last few years they had been teaching a wonderful community-endorsed Yaygirr language program. They haven't been able to continue teaching this year due to the original funding from the IAS being cut. The cost to run such a program is roughly $18,000 each year. Yet you can go and give away $500,000 just like that.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This school in New South Wales is desperately seeking funding, and it's not the only story. There are many examples coming in from around the country of organisations and individuals who feel this and who are questioning what is going on with the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. What is going on in Indigenous affairs under this government? Who is in charge? Is it the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Nigel Scullion? Or do we have another Indigenous affairs minister in special envoy Tony Abbott? Where is the Prime Minister in all of this? Who is making the decisions?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not having the respectful engagement on the ground with First Nations people, and the people of this country are sick of it. The people of Borroloola are sick of it. Lift your game! People desperately need houses. Don't play with their lives like this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250362" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  It seems that almost every day we are met with a new far-right conservative movement. The spectrum ranges from straight-up neo-Nazis, or fascists masquerading as libertarians, to the tinfoil hat brigade with their United Nations conspiracy theories. Some of them are in this very parliament. Collectively, I call these groups 'merchants of hate'. Perhaps 'charlatans' or 'quacks' would be better terms. They prey on the anxieties of Australians and offer solutions that are empty, hateful and divisive. They shadow-box with imaginary enemies, whipping up hysteria against minorities to cover for their own inadequacies. Why? Because they find it easier to destroy communities than to build them. Where is their vision? Where are their big ideas for a better Australia? When we open the cupboards and inspect their wares we realise how little they have to offer but breathless rhetoric.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have big problems in this country: wages are stagnant and corporations refuse to bear their fair share of tax so that we can fund essential public services like schools, universities, TAFE, health care and public transport. People are being left behind. More than 116,000 people are homeless, and that number is rising. Each and every day, more than 250 people are turned away from homelessness services because governments around the country refuse to fund them properly. A culture of corruption and the revolving door between politics and big business costs us all. The voices of big money, and their donations, echo far more loudly in the corridors of parliament than do the voices of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead of offering solutions that will actually help people in our society, the merchants of hate choose to whip up hysteria against minorities in this country because it suits their weak-minded political vision that hopes to keep Australia in turmoil. It is the classic divide-and-rule, distract-and-act mentality: point to an imaginary enemy and hope that no-one notices you don't actually want solutions because you thrive on problems, conflict and suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The merchants of hate are selling Australians lies, because that is all they have. What else can we conclude when parties like One Nation talk about 'Aussie battlers' but then go ahead and vote to strip billions of dollars out of our public schools? They talk a big game but, time and time again, they side with the Liberals and the big end of town. They tell their supporters one thing and then do another. I wonder how they sleep at night?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mario Peucker, a postdoctoral research fellow at Victoria University's Centre for Cultural Diversity and Wellbeing, has looked at the far Right and its emergence. According to a news.com.au article he found that economic betrayals of workers and everyday people by elites around the world have led to the far Right seizing upon the fears that people have about the future. He noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia, the UK and the US have their individual circumstances but there is an underlying root cause and that is there are economic shifts and social shifts that some segments of society arenât happy with. Some people feel left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A relatively large segment of the society, although still a minority, feels like theyâre kind of stuck in their socio-economic mobility, they donât have hope that their kids will be in a better socio-economic position. They might have a job but they feel like they might lose it. They probably think they might lose it to some overseas investor who might bring in their own overseas workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So thereâs a lot of fear about the future and this fear drives some kind of self-protection and a feeling that it 'used to be better' and wanting political leaders to recognise them and their situation and do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than providing ideas that address the root of people's anxieties and concernsâroots like neoliberalism and constant attacks on working people by politicians and governmentsâthe merchants of hate exploit those anxieties to get themselves elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Underlying these groups like One Nation, and perhaps within them, are a whole range of weird and whacky groups. Some are comical, but some are quite dangerous. These groups embrace weird conspiracy theories about Agenda 21, the New World Order and the United Nations, and there are too many who consider climate change to be some elaborate international hoax. Others seek to persecute people under the banner of patriotism and nationalism. Some even embrace the vile ideology of Nazism. Scratch the surface and you find sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and, of course, racism and intolerance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: this isn't a new phenomenon. We've always had far-right fringe parties like the League of Rights, National Action, the Australian Nationalist Movement and Australians Against Further Immigration. In recent years, a plethora of primarily online based groups has exploded. This echoes what is happening around the world. In August 2018, the so-called Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in the United States saw far-right extremist groups openly rally with horrifying chants attacking the Jewish community in particular. One of them drove a car into a group of peaceful protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia, ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Background Briefing </span>recently exposed the far-right wing infiltration of the New South Wales Young Nationals, where members of the alt-Right succeeded in getting a seat on the executive. At their national conference in May, new members started putting forward motions calling for the party to endorse immigration from culturally compatible peoples and nations, with strict immigration controls for those who are not. To their credit, the Nationals have taken swift action to remove these people from their party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who is responsible for the rise of the far Right and legitimatising hate? The current government have to bear some responsibility for stoking the flames of division. Just recently, we saw the whole of the Liberal and National parties walk in here and indulge Senator Pauline Hanson's obsession with race by supporting that vile motion. We know exactly what they were doing; they were telegraphing to the far Right and racists to tell them: 'Don't worry, we have your back.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The media has to bear some responsibility. Sky News continues the cycle of 'outrage, apologise, outrage, apologise', knowingly inviting racists and fascists onto its shows to generate media. <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunrise</span> regularly paid Pauline Hanson to join its show before she was elected to parliament. Even the ABC felt it was okay to devote an entire episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> to Steve Bannon. Bannon, the former Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, is hardly a marginalised voice. He is a man who has edited a website, Breitbart News Network, that was and still is openly Islamophobic, sexist and racist and appeals to the very worst of human nature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The far Right also relies on social media to spread its lies. I have highlighted many times the kinds of racist and misogynistic abuse that comes my way. We know that social media has become a breeding ground of hate and fake news, but those platforms have not taken seriously their responsibility to protect their users from abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news, though, is that it doesn't have to be this way. There is another way. The far Right has been exposed as the emperor with no clothes. While they stand around furiously stamping their feet, trying to direct attention away from the fact that they have nothing substantial to offer, there are people working hard to build a better future for all of us. I got involved in politics because I wanted to give a voice to marginalised and ignored people and to the environment and animals. A core part of the Greens' mission is to champion the voices of those silenced, to dissent on behalf of the dissenters. Every day, these long-silenced voices and long-shut-out decision-making processes are speaking more loudly and demanding to be heard. It is up to us to change the narrativeâto expose the far Right for their empty promises and hateful rhetoric that offers nothing but bile and certainly no solutions to everyday problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of it is a narrow neoliberal agenda that consistently prioritises the interest of big business and big money above people. The reason we have decaying social infrastructure, high youth unemployment, insecure work and a rising cost of living is not because of migrants, ethnic communities, refugees or Muslims; it's because governments over decades have not prioritised people's needs. They have not invested for the public; rather, they have sold off our public services and assets and helped fill the deep pockets of their mates in big business. It is the politicians and their mates who ingratiate themselves at the expense of the public. They should be the target of your anger, not already marginalised people who are being locked out of having a say on how our country is run. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, instead of coming in here and piling hate on people and communities you don't like, for once try and bring in some real debate, some substance, about how we can turn Australia into a country where everyone thrives. You might be surprised at the response you get. You might even feel good about it.</span>

What an outrageous contribution from the Greens! Mind you, we don't expect anything less than that. On occasions, they seem to be able to lower the bar so far, and now they're on all fours to get under their own bar. The Greens party have done so much to restrict employment and the development of industries in this country. There was not one word from the senator about the 180,000 jobs in the coal industry that are in jeopardy in my home state because of their policies. That was an outrageous contribution. It's an attack on freedom of speech. </span>

                  </a>  No, that's their position, Senator. They made it clear here during the week in debates around issues to do with minimum wages and the like. They want to take away from festivals and carnivals the tracker dogs that are there to test people for drugs, whereas we want safe public environments where people can go, where people on ice and all sorts of things are not participating in large crowds, causing havoc. These people won't be happy until we're all sucking on tofu made from dried grass, lying around all day waiting for the Commonwealth to send some money into their bank account so they can go and do whatever they like. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am tired of being attacked when I stand up and speak about some issues around strong values that I still believe are the strong values of the majority of Australians. That presentation by that senator was very poorly prepared, very poorly researchedâthat's one explanation. The other is that she stood there and provided bold-faced lies around some of the stats she mentioned. She talked about unemployment. Under this government we have lowered the unemployment rate to the lowest it's been in decades. She comes in here and makes attacks on us to continue to try and marginalise those of us in this place and the other place that are centre Right conservatives. We can't open our traps. You cannot say the word 'abortion' without being attacked by this mob of almostâI would say 'grubs' if I didn't think you were going to make me withdraw it, Mr Acting Deputy President. But it's out there now. These people came and attacked me for my religious basis the other day, using words like 'rosary beads', because I had the audacity to raise issues around late-term abortions, where babies that are only minutes away from getting a smack on the arse and a name are being aborted under the policies of the Australian Greens. </span>

I will not stand mute while these people try to continue to marginalise policies and ideas that we want to discuss for this nation that I think are still largely supported by the majority of the nation. There's no question about that. They are an ever-increasingly silent majority because they're not game to speak. I've had it in here. I've moved sensible motions here, reflecting the views of so many people in our society, only to have formality denied. </span>

The behaviour of these people is despicable. To come in here, with the freedom that they have, and vomit the vitriol that comes out of their mouthsâit needs to be called out. That wasn't the reason I came in to speak, but I've made a contribution.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my five years in the Senate, it's well known that I have concentrated on the affairs of agriculture and our provincial communities across the country. I'm coming to the end of my contribution as a politician, as you know, at the end of June next year. My reflection on where we are at is that, as a governmentâI don't care if it's the mob sitting over there or the mob sitting over hereâwe need to have a thorough look at better coordinating our efforts around agriculture in this country. I'm not going to be critical of efforts to date, but a lot of itâand it's not unique to this governmentâhas been reactionary. We wait until we get a critical situation, and then we consider what we might do. As everyone knows, if you're going to fix a hole in a rainwater tank, it's a lot harder to do if you let it form in the first place. So, I really believe that our governmentâand I'll be lobbying very hard to try and have this consideredâneeds to have an audit inquiry, or whatever you want to call it, into the bush so that we can better coordinate and better look at what policies, programs and assistance need to be put in place to head off problems in the future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you an example. The government recently allocated $4.5 million to the University of Southern Queenslandâand good luck to them for getting the fundingâto run a program to educate midwives to go and work in rural communities. At the same time, the state governmentâI'm not going to play politics here and put labels on peopleâhas decided to close 27 birthing clinics in my home state of Queensland.

                  </a>  Don't attack me; I am allowed to talk about mums and birthing issues, Senator Hinch, before you get up on your high horse and flick me with your whip. These mums will now have to travel incredible distances to be able to do what every other mum in metropolitan and regional areas enjoys as a matter of course. I've talked to mums six months into their confinement out in Birdsville and Bedourie and all of those places where once you could have had your baby. They can't anymore. If they've got some feature about their confinement that's an issue of sorts then they have to travel to Adelaide or Brisbane, three months prior to the anticipated birthdate. For three months they've got to leave the property, their husband and their childrenâin many instances, young children educated by mum and the School of the Air. What happens with all that? It gets tipped completely on its head because they simply can't enjoy a basic community service that every single one of us elsewhere takes for granted. These are people who travel 14 hours to get to a dentist. We had a Royal Flying Doctor Service with its own mobile dental service. I was critical of my own government because we withdrew the funding. We reinstated it, fortunately. But these are the things that are happening. </span>

If there were to be a change of government at some time in the future across to the opposition, that rule book could be picked up and the script followed so that we can rebuild rural and provincial Australia. It's had a flogging. We need to fix matters around education. Communications have been much improved. In health, we need connectivity. We've got an inquiry going at the moment into air services. Rural people are paying four or five times the amount to travel than we do when we travel the same distance between metros. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  It was good to see Senator O'Sullivan finish as he started. I, too, want to talk about an issue that confronts, increasingly, regional Australia. Acting Deputy President Duniam, I know the long-term plight of workers in regional communities, particularly those associated with energy and power stations is an issue you have been concerned about and is of particular concern to me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about the direction of energy policy in this country under the LNP. What we're increasingly seeing from the other side, and what we heard from Senator Abetz's contribution in senators' statements, is just a scare campaign. There was a scare campaign about housing prices and a scare campaign about dividend imputation policy. We're increasingly seeing a scare campaign about energy from those opposite as well. The LNP have been in government now for five years, so they've had five years to come up with an energy policy. What we've seen in that time is prices go up, emissions go up and reliability go down. It's an issue that has already cost one Prime Minister his job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's been the policy paralysis by the government over the last 18 months? We know they previously put forward an emissions intensity scheme. We know they then moved to a clean energy target and, more recently, they've had the National Energy Guarantee. As they've abandoned each of those policies they've also abandoned some pre-eminent AustraliansâChief Scientist Alan Finkel, and, more recently, Kerry Schottâwho were integral to the drafting of those policies and an attempt to reach a consensus with the Labor opposition. The government have not only abandoned all of those policies but also any sense that they can reach a bipartisan agreement on policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the government have junked all of those policies, all we have increasingly seen from those opposite is a scare campaign. The LNP have been attempting to run a scare campaign in Queensland on the back of resources as well. We've seen it from Minister Canavan over a long period of time, and we saw it again on Monday in question time. Mining rehabilitation has become a significant issue in Queensland, particularly on the back of the collapse of Clive Palmer's nickel refinery in Townsville. There's obviously a significant environmental legacy that has been left there. The Queensland government has been acting responsibly to deal with the debacle and put in place legislation that ensures something like that can never happen again. In question time on Monday, Senator Canavan, when asked about this, basically used the opportunity to mount a scare campaign against the Labor Party in Queensland. He said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ but unfortunately there are moves afoot by the Queensland government to impose a massive new cost on the Queensland resources sector just as some green shoots are emerging â¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that the agenda here is to hurt the mining sector and to hurt mining jobs, not to protect the environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the scare campaign we saw from Minister Canavan in question time on Monday. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet what did I read in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today? It was an article by none other than the Queensland Resources Council's chief executive, Ian Macfarlane. Many people in this chamber will be aware of his background. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We look forward to the updated bill passing the house, which will allow a world-standard rehabilitation fund to begin collecting interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the council's chief executive said today in relation to the legislation that is expected to pass the Queensland parliament this week. There's no retrospectivity involved, and all we've seen from Senator Canavan is scaremongering. That's increasingly what we're seeing when it comes to energy and resource issuesâscare campaigning from the other side. We know that they do that because they're incapable of actually articulating their policy going forward, so all they've got left in the kitbag is to run a scare campaign against Labor. We're seeing it on energy and resourcing, and, as I highlighted earlier, we're seeing it increasingly on economic issues as well. But when they can't talk about their record, and when they can't agree on what they want to do for the future, it's no wonder that that's where they ended up. And increasingly we're seeing that in the months before the lead-up to the federal election, as they basically present what is a hoax of an energy policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is being made up on the run; it's clearly a thought bubble with regard to energy. Basically, they have sticky tape holding it together. I think that the main aim of the policy that they're attempting to put together is to appeal to those dinosaurs on the backbench in the LNP. Senator Cormann, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, gave us valuable insight into how much of a joke the LNP energy policy is in an interview on Sky News<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>yesterday. He was asked, 'As a general rule, do you like the idea of government intervening in the private sector?' This is with regard to the policy, the thought bubble, the government are putting forward. This is Senator Cormann's response: 'As a general rule, I support government policy. We operate as a team. We operate under the Westminster system.' In my experience, any time a government member has to rely on the Westminster system to defend their policy ideas, it just shows you how divided the government is when it comes to this policy thought bubble that has been put forward by the new minister. The interviewer then went on to ask, 'What would be the circumstances under which the government would break up a private company here?' And Senator Cormann's response was, 'These are not judgments for me to make.' This was the government's Senate leader not prepared to answer questions about the policy thought bubble that has been put forward by the government. I think that just shows you that this is absolutely policy on the run, that it has not been thought through and that there is obviously division on the government's side about how such a proposal would be brought forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no wonder that we've seen in recent weeks criticism from industry and others who are concerned about this policy. We know the Australian Energy Council are on the record as having concerns about it. We know Infrastructure Partnerships Australia are on the record as having concerns about this policy, and we also know that the chair of the ACCC, Rod Sims, said that the first he heard about this policy was when he read about it in the newspaper. So it's clear from that analysis that the LNP is only interested in thought bubbles rather than the substantial, long-term policy change and reform that is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who is suffering under the inaction of those opposite? We know the reality is that families are suffering because of the high prices they're paying. We know that workers and businesses are struggling because of the policy uncertainty. But we also know that communities are suffering. There is an alternative, but it does require a government that will actually think long termâa government that will plan, be honest and be up-front with communities at the same time. No scare campaignsâwe need a government that will manage these policy transitions in the long-term national interest. If you bury your head in the sand, you'll end up with situations like we saw with the communities around the Hazelwood Power Station closure. The workers in that community were given six months notice that the power station was going to close down under this government. I will give some credit to the Victorian government, who at least scrambled to get some policy settings in place to ensure that community did not suffer too greatly as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Canavan likes to mention what the CFMEU are up to with regard to their concerns about some Queensland legislation, but I haven't heard him mention once the report that the CFMEU have done that actually looks at the transformation of energy policy and the impact that it is going to have on communities, workers and their members. The report goes into substantial detail about the impact that this will have on communities. Basically, these communities and workers have been suffering because there has not been a developed, coherent and sensible energy policy by the coalition, who are intent on pushing the fantasy of new coal-fired power stations in spite of the fact that companies who own and operate these coal-fired power stations have no plans to build new ones and have consistently reiterated that the economics of constructing coal-fired power plants simply do not stack up. It goes on to highlight a number of issues in regard to the current policy settings that are going to have a long-term impact on those communities and those workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we on the Labor side will not bury our heads in the sand. We want to take on reports like that, because we know that we don't want to see those workers and those communities left behind. It is an important bit of work that the union have done on behalf of their members. It's okay for the minister to cherrypick on one issue, but he won't actually look at the substantial issues that that union raise because they are concerned about their members. But we on the Labor side know that they need representation that is going to think long term and put an energy plan in place that is going to ensure that those workers and communities have a stable future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HINCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  Nightly on the news we're seeing the carnage in California as that state suffers the deadliest bushfires in its history. The death toll has now climbed above 40. Hundreds of people are still missing. The fires have scorched and destroyed thousands of acres and thousands of homes. The ironically named town of Paradise is now ashes. More than 6,000 homes are gone forever. The home of Australian actor Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus in Malibu is gone. Military veterans say that Northern California now reminds them of a war zone. Australians can empathise with Californians after Ash Wednesday, Black Saturday and the 2003 bushfires here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australian firemen have actually been deployed to help the Americans battle fires in California. There are no Aussies there right now, but earlier this year they were there. Crews from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and New Zealand formed a contingent that was 140 strong. They've all since returned home to prepare for our high alert bushfire season. Over the past 20 years, Australians have been deployed 17 times across the world, including to Indonesia, the United States, Canada and Greeceâwhich leads me to the reason for this statement today. Two weeks ago, I met with Wayne Rigg and Simon Butt, volunteers with the Country Fire Authority. Both have distinguished careers characterised by that sense of selflessness and bravery that is epitomised by our country's emergency service men and women. Wayne and Simon detailed their service both here in Australia and overseas. I was shocked and enamoured at times by some of their storiesâfrom fighting the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009 to picking up the phone and finding themselves halfway across the world only two days later fighting wildfires in California. Now, sadly, I was also shocked to learn that Australian firefighters who serve overseas do not receive recognition for that service, unlike other emergency service members who also risk their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like nearly every other country in the world, Australia has a system of honours and awards so that our citizens can be recognised for excellence, for achievement or for meritorious service. We give honours to recognise, celebrate and say thank you to those who risk their lives for others. Within the Australian honours system, medals are awarded to police and military personnel for their overseas service, through the Police Overseas Service Medal and the Australian Operational Service Medal. The Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal honours Australian groups for emergency humanitarian service overseas in often hazardous and dangerous circumstances. The primary intent when the HOSM was created was not for fire and emergency personnel. However, it is currently the only award that's available to them for overseas recognition of their work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian firefighters want the federal government to create an award, a new fire and emergency service overseas medal, and I support them 100 per cent. There are still applications going back nearly 20 years for the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal, and ideally those people would be eligible for the new fire and emergency medalâsadly, several of them posthumously. As I said, our firefighters and emergency service men and women epitomise selflessness and bravery. I believe they are entitled to a medal struck especially for them. On another issue, the time they've been based overseas must be included in their record of service.</span>

It is the principal and most prestigious means of recognising outstanding members of the Australian community.

To honour their contribution to our community, today in the chamber I'll read the names of each of those Western Australians that have been honoured and the citation. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I can't count the number of times that I've spoken in this place about the Abbott-Turnbull-and-now-Morrison governments' pathetic record on ageing and aged care. They have broken every single promise they've ever made to older Australians, and I will keep coming into this chamber, time after time, to remind them that they gave commitments to older Australians. We had the current Prime Minister making a commitment that older Australians were going to be a priority. Well, if the way that this portfolio has been managed is a priority for this Prime Minister, heaven help anyone that wasn't on the priority list; that's all I can say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're coming to the end of the parliamentary year. Christmas is just around the corner, and the government is still in chaos, still divided as ever and still failing to address the home care package waitlist crisis. And that's what it is in this country: it's a crisis. It's important. The severity of the home care waitlist crisis isn't lost among the Liberals' chaos and division. Under their government's watch there are now more than 121,000 people on the home care waiting list, including 96,000 of those peopleâthat's 96,000 older Australiansâwho are looking for the high care that they need at level 4. Many of these people are also living with dementia. How can the Prime Minister say that older Australians are a priority when around 56,000 of those older Australians are waiting with no home care package at all? They're not getting a level 1 or 2 package, which is what they try and tell us at estimates. The average wait time, according to the government's own data, for a level 3 or 4 package is still more than 12 months, and we know that some older Australians have been waiting more than two years for care. These numbers are worse than shocking; they are appalling, and this government should be ashamed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My biggest concern right now is that the government like to pretend that they're doing things in this space when in fact they're not. They overpromise and underdeliver. They like to cherry-pick the figures to paint a rosy picture. But one thing is for sure: they have failed to curb the growing waitlist, full stop. They've failed. Their half-baked solutions have been completely inadequate, not coming even close to what is needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know that the government is not really a government of transparency. We know the minister deliberately sat on the last two rounds of data on the home care package waitlist. We also know that the next round of data is due in the next couple of weeks. Well, what I don't want to see is the form of this government, which is that those figures will be released on Christmas Eve so that they can try to cover up how extensive this waitlist has become.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that they haven't been able to address this, and I know their mantra at the moment is, 'We've got a royal commission in place.' We do, in fact, have a royal commission in place. We won't go back over how that came about; it was another thought bubble of the Prime Minister without any consultation. I did try to ask questions. In fact, I asked when the Prime Minister was briefed by the department on the need to have a royal commissionâbut I couldn't get any answersâbecause the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care said only two weeks before it was announced that there was no need for a royal commission. I will say yet again, as I have said countless times in this chamber, that you do not need to wait till the royal commission hands down its findings in 2020 to address the issues that are confronting older people in this country today. We all know what the issues are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The waitlist for home care packages has blown out. I believe there are probably closer to 130,000 Australians now, but that'll be confirmed when they finally release the most recent data. As I said, we cannot afford to wait for this data to be released on the eve of Christmas. There is, quite frankly, no excuse for continuing to delay this data. Australians have a right to know how incompetent this government is. Older Australians deserve transparency and honesty. They deserve betterâso much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the list grows longer and longer, fresh stories emerge daily of older Australians waiting for home care. I've spoken a number of times about a 94-year-old gentleman who has been waiting for an extended period of time for care. I want to relay some tragic circumstances that are surrounding older Australians, to paint a human picture of the dire situation that so many older Australians are finding themselves in. These are stories of what the situation for older Australians has been. This is only over the last five days, to my office. I know my colleagues around the country have similar stories. An elderly woman with dementia was assessed as needing a level 4 home care package. Level 4 is the highest package that you can get for care in your own home. In September last year she was assessed for that level 4 package. She still hasn't been assigned an interim level 2 home care package. She is still over 12 months away from receiving that level 4 home care package she needs. That's unacceptable in Australia. That should be unacceptable to all on that side of the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another woman is impaired from a stroke and has been assessed as needing a level 3 package. That was all the way back in March last year. She agreed to receive an interim level 2 package, which never happened. She is still one to three months away from receiving her level 3 home care package. She's currently not receiving any home care at all. Her daughter is her full-time carer. This lady happens to be very lucky that she has got a daughter who can help her with that home care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, a woman in her late 80s was assessed as needing a level 4 home care package, as a high priority, in August 2016. You heard right: August 2016. She has been assessed and is still waiting. That's over two years. I can't believe that this government has been so neglectful, so out of touch, and so uninterested in addressing this issue. She is finally due to be assessed and assigned her package within the next month, but it took 800 days. Her husband is a full-time carer for her. Of course, he would be in his 80s as well, and I only hope that his health hasn't suffered because of the extra responsibility he has had for his wife. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Turnbull government and the Morrison government have had their difficulties in this area. But after Mr Turnbull was removed as Prime Minister, the current Prime Ministerâthe Prime Minister who referred to his own government as 'muppets'âhas had this responsibility. This government is too interested in its own dysfunction and internal battles to address the fundamental issues that are confronting older Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about home care packages, that's just one element. But we know from their own figures that there are 121,000 vulnerable older Australians who are being neglected by this government. We know that puts added responsibility and pressure onto state hospitalsâwhich they have also cutâbecause older people are either having to go into acute hospital care or they're ending up in residential care long before they should. The whole idea of having home care packages was to help older Australians to age well in their own home. This government has been irresponsible. They have failed in their duty of care. They're obviously not up to the job. They've had three or four ministers in this area of responsibility, and each and every one of them has failed. The Prime Minister has failed already on delivering what he said would be a priority of his government. What I say is, bring on the election, because a Shorten Labor government will give older Australians the care and respect they deserve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Yesterday the Indonesian trade minister said that the delay in signing the partnership agreement is 'because of Palestine', and he has also indicated that the agreement would be delayed while the embassy move remained on the table. Why did this minister mislead the Senate and Australians about the cause of the delay?</span>

I stand by the advice that I gave the Senate yesterday. I'm also pleased to confirm for the Senate that Indonesia and Australia remain committed to the agreement and are looking for an opportunity to sign. As I advised the senator yesterday, after the substantive agreement was reached on 31 August 2018, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and President Widodo present, there is now a process to be gone through to finalise the text in both languages. Indeed, the trade minister, our good friend and valued colleague Senator Birmingham, again confirmed today that the process we're going through now is to make sure that all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed, which is precisely what Senator Birmingham said today, and I stand by my advice to the Senate yesterday.</span>

This support is in relation to access to finance. Small businesses require access to finance in order to be successful, in order to prosper and in order to grow. However, it is well known that small businesses do have difficulties in finding access to finance. In fact, the RBA itself has said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast to large businesses, it remains challenging for young small businesses to fund their expansion plans.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, and as has been articulated by so many small businesses, banks are reluctant to lend to small businesses unless the funding is secured by real estate, and that is, typically, the family home. So what we have announced today as a government is that we will support small businesses all around Australia with the introduction of a $2 billion securitisation fund, to help them get better access to finance and grow their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is so important because there are around three million small businesses in Australia that employ around seven million Australians. And you need to as a government ensure that the businesses who cannot get access to finance are able to do this so that they can expand. When they expand, they prosper and grow. And when they prosper and grow, they employ more Australians. The securitisation fund will be administered by the Australian Office of Financial Management. What it's going to do is provide an additional source of funding to the smaller banks and non-bank lenders who, in turn, will be able to lend to small businesses at more competitive rates. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

As I travel around Australia talking to and listening to small businesses, many of them express their frustration to me about their struggles to obtain access to finance. What that means for them is they're not able to expand their business. They're not able to bid for a new contract. They're not able to invest in technology that might actually transform their business. So improving access to finance will allow these businesses to expand, to purchase that equipment they need in order to grow, to increase their earning capacity. Again, it comes down to when the small and family businesses of Australia prosper and grow they create more jobs for Australians, and the Australian economy as a whole benefits. </span>

The Auditor-General's audit of Tourism Australia, covering the period now Prime Minister Morrison was its managing director, found that under Mr Morrison Tourism Australia breached procurement guidelines, engaged companies before signing contracts and conducting value-for-money assessments, and withheld information from the board. Can the minister confirm that the New Zealand Auditor-General also conducted an inquiry into the New Zealand tourism board, covering the period now Prime Minister Morrison was the director of the New Zealand office for tourism and sport, and found Mr Morrison also withheld information from this board? Precisely how many audits, investigations and inquiries have been conducted into organisations being run by now Prime Minister Morrison?</span>

He has been able to deliver stronger growth, more jobs and a stronger and improving budget position, having inherited from Labor a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a deteriorating budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Today, global gas giant Woodside joined the mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP in calling for a carbon price to be reinstated. They want investment certainty because even the miners, Senator Canavan, understand that a carbon price is the most effective way to drive down emissions. Given that Woodside have donated nearly a million dollars to the coalition over the last decade so that they can write your other policies, why won't you listen to them on this one?</span>

I assume that the Greens, like us, wanted to see environmental policy that was also economically sensible. That is, of course, our position. Our position as a government is that we will continue to do what is right by the environment in a way that is economically responsible, because we don't believe there should be conflict between doing the right thing for the environment and doing the right thing by the economy, because doing the right thing by the economy is important for the future opportunities of Australians to get ahead, and that is going to continue to be our focus.</span>

It is an outstanding company which is doing great work and providing great opportunities for young Western Australians to pursue a career. You know what? Woodside actually helps to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by exporting LNG into locations around the world where it helps to reduce emissions in those economies.</span>

The Liberal and National parties made a decision some time ago that we did not want to push up electricity prices for families and business in a way that just shifts emissions to other parts of the world, where they would be higher for the same amount of economic output. I was just stunnedâimagine my surprise when I was sitting on this side opposing Labor's emissions trading scheme, and there was Senator Bob Brown and Senator Rachel Siewert and Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Christine Milneâand guess what happened? It went down. Don't come here telling us how important it is to have an emissions trading scheme. You voted against it. We at least are consistent. You go out there voting with us to do the right thing by the economy, and now you are here trying to virtue-signal in your contest with the Labor Party. Give me a break. </span>

We know what would happen if Labor and the Greens got into government, which is the indication of his preamble. If Labor and the Greens got back into government, do you know what would happen? They would put in place a carbon tax. It would push up the cost of electricity. It would harm the economy. It would harm investment. It would put jobs at risk. It would make Australians poorerâall just to shift emissions overseas, where, for the same amount of economic output, emissions would be higher. You would be forcing Australian families to make sacrifices for something that would actually make the world climate worse off. That is not sensible climate policy, and that is why we're continuing to pursue the policy agenda that we're pursuing. </span>

Australia is a small-business nation, and our economy is strong thanks to hardworking small and family businesses. A strong small-business sector means more jobs and stronger communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced that the Liberal-National government will provide even more support to help grow small businesses right across Australia. This announcement recognises the reality that small businesses are increasingly finding it more difficult to obtain finance to grow and to employ more people. The creation of the $2 billion Australian Business Securitisation Fund will enable greater access to finance for small businesses, on more competitive terms, when they need it. They'll also be able to support them to expand their operations and create more jobs locally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-seven per cent of Australian businesses are small businesses. They account for 33 per cent of Australia's GDP and employ over 40 per cent of our workforce. They pay 12 per cent of the company tax revenue. The announcement today is incredibly good news for small businesses operating right across regional Australia and in our home state of Victoria. </span>

                  </a>  Yes, Senator Carr, in the great electorate of Indi. The small-business fund couldn't have come at a better time. He said, 'There are great opportunities in overseas markets, but we're struggling to come up with the capital through normal channels to grow the business.' He said, 'The other benefit is that we will buy our wine vats regionally at other local businesses in Wodonga.' So other regional businesses win as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government understands the needs of small business. We have a strong track record of delivery, including cutting the small-business tax rate, extending the instant asset write-off and simplifying the BAS. With more than three million small businesses across the country, the government is strongly committed to focusing on them and the jobs they create.</span>

That's exactly why the creation of the fund will benefit small businesses like Bertolis agriculture in Shepparton. The owner, Paul Bertoli, employs around 40 locals and supplies machinery to farmers and businesses right across the north-east of Victoria. He said that he's constantly hearing how federal government support for small business is having a positive result for owners and their customers alike throughout the regions. Small businesses right across Australia understand it's only a Liberal-National government that will back them to grow and prosper.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor doesn't support small businesses. Neither Bill Shorten nor Daniel Andrews wants to see them grow and prosper. They still see small businessesâfamily owned and run businessesâas a continued threat to union membership. They especially fail to understand the importance of those businesses to regional communities. Union membership in the private sector has fallen, demonstrating that both unions and the Labor Party don't understand the modern reality of running a small, family owned operation. On this side of the chamber, we believe in providing the right conditions for small businesses to grow, be successful and employ more Australians. When you work hard to earn money, you should be able to keep more of that money. Those opposite believe in taking it away. We'll back business all the way.</span>

Minister, I listened intently at February estimates as you boasted that there had been a significant reduction in the wholesale gas prices on the east coast of Australia and went on to say that gas prices have come down to single digits over the past year. You stated that the signing of an MOU with gas exporters was key. Last estimates, you were silent on the topic. Why was that? Was it because AEMO's most recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly energy dynamics</span> report reveals that gas prices have increased across all markets, compared to quarter 3 of 2017, despite a reduction in demand, and that average prices in the declared wholesale gas market are the second highest on record? Isn't your one-page MOU not worth the paper it's written on, and haven't you again lost control of gas prices?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:31</span>):  I thank Senator Patrick for his question. Gas prices have fallen this year, compared to last, across the Australian east coast. Indeed, right now, I'm advised that the gas price in Wallumbilla, which is a hub for gas prices in Australia, near Roma, is $8.55 a gigajoule. That compares to the price when it peaked, in February last year, of $12.49 a gigajoule. It's a reduction of 22Â½ per cent over that period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying that, Senator Patrick is correct that in the past few months, as outlined in the report he indicated, there has been upward pressure on oil and gas prices around the world, and that, of course, has flowed through to Australia as well. Largely, that's as a result of factors outside the federal government's control, of course. It's around the decisions of OPEC and issues around sanctions in Iran.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, however, we have seen reductions of oil prices and gas prices in North Asia that have started to flow through to the Australian market. More importantly for us now, what the agreement we've got with gas producers is meant to do is make sure that Australian consumers and Australian manufacturers have access to Australian gas first, which they do now. That will ensure that prices here in Australia do not go above those overseas, as they did early last year, before the government acted. That is the case right now. Right now, the gas price at Wallumbilla, as I quoted before, is about $2 a gigajoule lower than prices prevailing in Asiaâa huge turnaround from the situation that existed early last year. Indeed, that is also reflected in the gas that is being delivered from Queensland coal seam gas fields to the rest of the market. For the last 12 months, around 100 petajoulesâaround a fifth of the east coast marketâhas flowed from Queensland to other markets, when early last year there was a net outflow from Queensland compared to the rest of the country.</span>

Doesn't AEMO's report state that 2019 electricity futures prices rallied over the quarter? In the five years of coalition government, we've had EIS, Finkel, CET, NEG, NEG-plus and now a fair dinkum scheme. Why should my constituents believe anything the coalition says about reducing power prices?</span>

It was not given with any sense of pride; it was given with a sense of shame. I think it's a shame for the country that prices in South Australia are some of the highest in the world. Action needs to be taken, and that is why, as I outlined yesterday, we've made sure that large energy companies no longer have access to challenge their regulatory decisions. That's helped bring $6 billion off power bills. That's why we've taken action on gas prices, as I outlined earlier. That's helped lower electricity prices as well. Indeed, the wholesale electricity price in the market, which covers South Australia, is down 18 per cent this year compared to last year, thanks at least in part to those actions. But, as I said yesterday, there's a lot more to do in South Australia. In particular, the report that Senator Patrick has been outlining outlines how the Energy Regulator has had to intervene over the last quarter to restrain renewable energy output to 10 per cent just to keep the lights on. That's why it's misguided to keep going for large Renewable Energy Target mandates which break the market and push up prices.</span>

Indeed, I have had meetings in the past couple of months, both collectively and individually, with gas users around the finalisation of the heads of agreement that you mentioned, and the government remains in constant contact with gas producers as well, to make sure we get good outcomes in these still-challenged markets. I do note that Brickworx, a large-energy manufacturer in your state, has recently concluded a gas agreement. Others have also had large-scale agreements concluded. There still remain other companies that are negotiating, and we're doing everything we can to make sure that the heads of agreement is met and that gas producers do offer Australian gas first. But I must say that heavy manufacturing in Victoria and South Australia specifically does need more gas produced in southern Australia. They need the Victorian government to end their moratorium. They need other governments to lift moratoriums. More gas supply in Victoria and South Australia is the sustainable answer for strong manufacturing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

APEC is the pre-eminent regional forum for promoting closer economic integration, free trade and investment, and sustainable and inclusive growth. In fact, APEC accounts for almost half of global trade, 60 per cent of global GDP and 12 of Australia's top-15 trading partners. This year's meeting will be held in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea, Australia's closest neighbour, starting this week, and we're very pleased to work with Papua New Guinea's government as it hosts this very important regional event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true to say that hosting APEC is an enormous undertaking. It is over 200 meetings and other events across a year, which culminates in the gathering of leaders and ministers. But Australia and Papua New Guinea, in particular, have a long-term and enduring strategic and economic partnership, and our support demonstrates the importance that we place on that relationship. At Papua New Guinea's requests, we are leading international security support at APEC. We have the Australian Federal Police working closely with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary. The ADF is providing high-end operational support across maritime, aviation and counterterrorism domains, which builds on our close defence partnership. I want to acknowledge those members of the ADF and the AFP who are carrying out this work. The Department of Home Affairs is also providing key equipment like air cargo X-ray scanners and passport scanners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've provided policy support for APEC through DFAT, through our high commission in Port Moresby, and our assistance to APEC is really an extension of our long-term and enduring defence cooperation and partnership with PNG, as I've mentioned. Wherever possible, we've been looking to ensure that our support is designed to provide an enduring benefit to Papua New Guinea beyond APEC, and I, for one, am very much looking forward to a very successful APEC period.</span>

APEC's role in promoting market openness and economic reform is more important now than ever, and I'm going to take the opportunity of my participation in APEC to underline the importance of that economic openness and of regional integration. As well, I'm going to take the opportunity to highlight, in particular, Australia's focus on women's economic empowerment. Australia has been strongly supporting APEC's work in setting standards, particularly for digital trade, which is part of our work in leading WTO discussions and shaping global rules on ecommerce. We're also supporting APEC's focus on inclusive growth in the region, led by PNG, by supporting initiatives to help develop economies in remote areasâwhich, given the nature of PNG itself, is a very good exemplar of that work.</span>

They reflect the priorities raised with me and with Senator Ruston, for example, by Pacific leaders and ministers, and they reflect the government's ongoing dialogue with our key partners in the region, who are very important to us even if not to those opposite, who can't give the chamber the respect of listening to these observations. They build on our existing Pacific step-up and they also build on Australia's commitment under the foreign policy white paper. Our Australian infrastructure financing facility will significantly boost infrastructure development in Pacific countries and in Timor Leste, and we know that is a billions-of-dollars challenge to address in coming years. It will build on our long track record of supporting critical infrastructure in the Pacific.</span>

The US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, released their 41st quarterly report on 30 October, revealing that billions of dollars in Western foreign aid has been lost to widespread waste, lax oversight and endemic corruption. Special Inspector John Sopko stated that aid had been used to build medical clinics with no power or water, schools without children and programs that hired ghost workersânon-existent bureaucrats, police and soldiers. SIGAR highlighted major probity issues with two key funds: the World Bank's Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund and the UN administered Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan. Given the history of the US and DFAT concerns, and Canada declaring on Thursday that it may start its own independent audits, will the minister commit to SIGAR-style independent audits to this parliament?</span>

Australia makes a very significant contribution to security and to development assistance in Afghanistan and has done over many years now. In fact, a significant number of Australians have paid for our support for counterterrorism efforts and freedom in Afghanistan with their lives. The issues that Senator Bernardi raises in relation to integrity, transparency and accountability in terms of the delivery of development assistance are, of course, very important ones. They are ones that we take seriously in the administration of our own contributions. I will take the detail of Senator Bernardi's question on notice in relation to specific aspects of the report that he has raised and return to the chamber with further information.</span>

No, I disagree with my colleague's assessment on that matter. We have a very strong relationship with our Pacific neighbours. Indeed, it's a relationship that this government is continuing to invest in. In the past week, we have made very significant announcements and investments in regard to strengthening that relationship with our Pacific neighbours, including by establishing funds for infrastructure in Pacific regions. This week, of course, the Prime Minister will be visiting Papua New Guinea to meet with other leaders in APEC and also announcing further important investments in Papua New Guinea. We take our relationship with the Pacific extremely seriously, and Minister Price is part of a government that is progressing all of those relationships in a detailed, considered and substantive way. We will continue to work with our Pacific neighbours to make sure we strengthen their economies, along with the relationships and contributions they make to our country. I look forward to continuing to work with Minister Price on those matters.</span>

I know that, like me and other members of this government, she supports and continues to work towards better relationships with our Pacific neighbours. As I outlined in answer to the earlier question, just in the past week the government has announced further funding to strengthen that relationship with our Pacific neighbours, including a $2 billion infrastructure financing facility, which the Prime Minister says will focus on energy, water and transport needs for our Pacific neighbours. We're also, of course, committed to helping our Pacific neighbours tackle challenges around climate change, and we've supported programs in that area as well. We will continue to work to strengthen our relationship with our Pacific neighbours, as we have done the whole time we've been in government.</span>

She's a strong advocate particularly for Western Australia as wellâthe importance of balancing the environment with economic activity in that state. And I know from my relationship with her and communication with her that she's a strong cabinet minister in this Morrison-McCormack government. She will continue to play a very important role in developing relationships with other countries, especially, of course, on environmental matters, many of which do require global cooperation. Minister Price is leading on many of these different issues, which she will continue to do, and I'm confident she will continue to be part of a government that will strengthen our relationship with our Pacific neighbours. We will concentrate on the substantive matters between our two different countries and regions to make sure we've a stronger Asia-Pacific region for the whole globe.</span>

This week one of our nation's largest LNG processing facilities will be officially opened. Shipments from the IMPEX Ichthys project started a couple of weeks ago, and this week we look forward to welcoming the Japanese Prime Minister, other Japanese officials and IMPEX officials to officially open the IMPEX project. This is a landmark for the resources sector. It is also a landmark in the relationship between our two nations, which is already an incredibly strong one but which is being strengthened with this very important investment. This investment in the IMPEX project is the largest foreign investment by a Japanese company anywhere in the globe, and I think it is incredibly reflective of the strength of our two nations that this investment is occurring, in part, in Darwin, where we will welcome the first visit from a Japanese Prime Minister to Australia in history this week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also pay tribute to the Territorians who have helped build this project. It is the largest investment project in the Northern Territory and an incredibly important contributor to their economy. It has established Darwin, in particular, as a very important resources hub for our nation. It's an exporter of a huge amount of wealth and a creator of jobs. It is something we hope to build on in coming years with future resource projects in the Territory and elsewhere. There is so much expertise now in the Northern Territory that we can use as a platform to make the Northern Territory a stronger economy, to strengthen its relationships with Asian neighbours to the north and to take advantage of the enormous opportunities occurring in our part of the world with economic growth and economic development.</span>

At the peak of the project, 10,000 people were employed on this particular site, but I'd like to, in the limited time I have, particularly focus on the benefits to the local Indigenous community. As I said, it's been the largest project in the Northern Territory's history, and that has meant that throughout the project 1,471 Indigenous Australians have been provided with employment and 62 Aboriginal businesses have been contracted to work with the project, and those contracts have amounted to $175 million in value. It has been one of the most enormous benefits to Indigenous Australians from a specific project in our nation's history. Tomorrow, I will have the honour of joining INPEX as they sign an agreement with the Larrakia people, a $24 million investment to provide further benefits to the local Indigenous community over the next 40 years.</span>

Those investments will take Australia to be the world's largest exporter of LNG, something to take great pride in. I know Senator Brockman is a great supporter of the contribution that the Western Australian gas industry makes to these results for all Australians. The good news is that the demand for this product is continuing to grow. Yesterday's <span style="font-style:italic;">World Energy Outlook</span>, released by the International Energy Agency, shows that Australia's LNG exports are expected to double from their current levels by 2040. There are enormous future opportunities for Darwin, for Western Australia and for our whole country if we continue to have the policy settings right to attract investment into liquid natural gas and continue to provide those thousands of jobs to Australians. It will particularly help our First Australians get ahead, get jobs and start businesses.</span>

It found that more women are choosing to become their own bosses in NBN connected regions, creating their own businesses at twice the rate of men in the same communities and at a pace far higher than regions without NBN. The annual growth rate of self-employed women in NBN connected areas is 2.3 per cent versus 0.1 per cent in non-NBN connected areas. By 2021 NBN is expected to drive an additional up to 52,000 self-employed women. Let me indicate again: this is research undertaken by the firm AlphaBeta, headed by economist Andrew Charlton, who has a work history as an economic adviser to former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.</span>

The good news is that to date we have been able to circumvent the threat posed by those opposite by pursuing a different path to the one that they had embarked upon when they were in office. Had we continued on the path chosen by those opposite, there would be people waiting until 2025 for the NBN. Through the approach that we've followed, the NBN will be completed a good six to eight years sooner than would otherwise have been the case. Something which should be a self-evident point is that businesses that don't have the NBN can't have the benefit of the NBN. Under this government, business is getting the benefit of the NBN much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. This is good news for Australian businesses, and objective, independent, authoritative research proves that to be the case.</span>

We learnt in Senate estimates that the decision to consider moving the Australian embassy in Israel wasn't taken to cabinet; that it wasn't based on any proposal from DFAT; that the foreign minister, Senator Payne, was given less than 48 hours notice; and that the media was briefed before the Australian Defence Force. Mr Turnbull warned that it would prompt a very negative reaction from Indonesia and he was right.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this trade deal, 99 per cent of Australian exports to Indonesia will be tariff freeâexports like frozen beef, sheep meat, feed grains, steel coil, citrus products, carrots and potatoes. But now, because of Mr Morrison's short-sighted, ill-considered decision, Australian farmers, Australian manufacturers and Australian workers will suffer. But this isn't just about trade. Indonesia is a critical relationship to Australia, but it is fair to say that our bilateral ties struggle to reach their full potential.</span>

                  </a>  You may not be interested, Senator, but we actually care about this relationship. Indonesia is the world's fourth-largest country by population and is projected to be the fourth-largest economy by 2050. The largest economy in South-East Asia, Indonesia is critical to Australia's security and stabilityâsomething Labor has always understood, from Curtin and Chifley through Keating and Hawke and the Rudd and Gillard governments. Yet, under this government, our trade with Indonesia has actually decreased. As Mr Morrison said in Singapore, just moments ago after meeting with Indonesia's President:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Indonesia doing well economically, Indonesia doing well strategically, is good for Australia, and that's why we do it. We do it because it's good for our national interests to support Indonesia's advancement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that 'it's good for our national interests'. Well, Prime Minister, perhaps you should have put that on your lapel badge: 'Do what's good for Australia's national interests'. Instead, you trashed the national interests to try to get votes in Wentworth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even worse, now we are seeing this terrible decision dragged through the prism of the Liberal Party's bitter internal divisions. The same people who tore down Malcolm Turnbull and elevated Mr Morrison are now weaponising the embassy decision to continue their hard right, divisive agenda to undermine another Liberal Prime Minister. We've already seen Senator Abetz gleefully leaping onto <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> to undermine our relationship with Indonesia. 'Brilliant Mr Morrison', who is supposed to be such a strategic genius, has now, after losing votes on this issue in Wentworth, firmly wedged himself, between the national interest and the interests of the people who made him Prime Minister. He is trapped between doing the right thing by the nation and returning to sensible bipartisan policy. But, if he does, he will face the political consequences from the hard right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Australia should consider foreign policy decisions based on our national interests. But that means that you have to be responsible enough to act consistently for the national interest. The overturning of the bipartisan position on the location of the embassy in Israel for short-term political gain was not in our national interests. Well, Labor says 'enough'. Under pressure from journalists in Singapore, Mr Morrison has just committed to making a decision on the embassy by Christmas. Why Christmas, Prime Minister? Why not now? It took you one day to wreck this trade deal; why do you have to wait another month to fix it? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  I'm absolutely gobsmacked at the extraordinary hypocrisy of the Labor Party, weeping hot tears of grief on a free trade agreement after five free trade agreements have already been negotiated by the coalition; two of which I vaguely remember the Labor Party actually tried to scuttleâthe China free trade agreement and the TPP. Yet now they come in here bleating about an Indonesia free trade agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with Senator Wong on one thing: she is absolutely right when she says that the partnership between Australia and Indonesia is one of our nation's most significant. She is right, because Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and it presents significant and profound opportunities for Australia as the demand grows for our goods and our services and particularly our produce. It has a rapidly growing consumer base and it is projected to be the world's fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050. By bolstering the economic ties between our nations it will lead to even greater opportunities for Australian businesses, for Australian manufacturers and for Australian farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our extensive relationship with Indonesia is both mature and strong. It sustains constructive dialogue on all issues of common interest and it is steeped in the history of both our nations. Do you know what, Madam Deputy President? Prime Minister Morrison, who is talking about an Indonesian free trade agreement as we sit here today, is just the right man to do it. We can rely on Prime Minister Morrison to make the right deals. When we are dotting the i's and crossing the t's, as Senator Cormann mentioned, on this free trade agreement he is the right man to be doing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's a man that we've trusted with the most important decisions of this government for the last five years. If we think about it, at the stage when the coalition came to office it was Mr Morrison who was the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. He was the man who stopped the boats. He was the man who turned them around and sent them back. He was the man who shut down 18 detention centres in the last five years. He was the man who did that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he was the Minister for Social Services, he was the one who reduced our welfare dependency to its lowest rate in 25 years. And, of course, as Treasurer his track record speaks for itself. We now have economic growth of 3.4 per cent. That is at the top of the OECD league ladder and it is the envy of the developed world. We have created more than 1.2 million jobs in the last five years alone; 89,000 were what the Labor Party created in their last year of government. That's 89,000 compared to 1.2 million new jobs, with around 400,000 in the last 12 months. The vast majority of those were full-time, and the vast majority went to women. In fact, the female participation rate is at higher levels than it has ever been at before. Youth unemployment is down to low levelsâthe lowest levels in 25 years. We've maintained our AAA credit rating from not one, not two, but three credit-rating agencies. And, of course, the budget is on its way back to balance one year earlier than anticipated. That's what good fiscal management will deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And good fiscal management pays political dividends, because people want an economy that's creating jobs and they want an economy that's growing, and they trust Prime Minister Morrison to deliver it in the same way that they have trusted Prime Minister Morrison to negotiate the finer points of an Indonesian free trade agreementâan Indonesian free trade agreement which is part of our growth strategy for the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is the sixth free trade agreement that we've negotiated in just five years. Think about it: the China free trade agreement was a game-changing and transformative agreement for the Australian economy. There was China, Japan, South Korea and the TPPâof course, we could hardly forget the TPP. We nearly didn't get that through; that was only in the last couple of weeks. Now there is Peru and, finally, Indonesia in just five years. That's how we create the opportunities for Australian businesses and that's how we ensure our economy stays strong. That's how we can ensure that there are jobs and growth for future generations of Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  Today's question time reinforced, just as yesterday's did, that we have a reckless, big-talking Prime Minister who is full of big promises and short on attention to detail, delivery and any sense of the national interest. His desperate decision to try to win votes in Wentworth is costing us jobs and is at great expense to our relationships not only with Indonesia but with many other parts of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen Mr Morrison, our Prime Minister, junk a longstanding bipartisan foreign policy, and it is a key foreign policy that is important to the success of the Australia-Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. We saw Senator Cormann arguing that the i's and the t's are just being dotted and crossed, and that's the reason for the delay. But Indonesia's own trade minister says the delay in signing the agreement is because of Palestine. You may say that it's about dotting the i's and crossing the t's, but the simple fact is that it is delayed because the question of moving the embassy to Jerusalem has not been resolved and ruled out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hume says that this is in fact about Mr Morrison debating and refining the finer points of the agreement. Frankly, I think that is bollocks. We know that the delay is about getting this issue of this nonsense idea of moving Australia's embassy to Jerusalem off the table. We've seen this entrench further division and chaos in the coalition. We saw Senator Abetz, who is in fact the government's chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, suggesting that Australia rethink the $360 million we give them in aid each year. I'm assuming Senator Abetz is a great fan of moving the embassy to Jerusalem. The idea that a view like that could be reflected in the media or in this place shows the disregard with which members of this place are prepared to treat the important views of Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison said last September that the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement would be signed within months. The media had been briefed that it would be signed this week on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Singapore. Again Senator Cormann and Senator Hume might say, 'No, this is actually all about Prime Minister Morrison getting the job done, making sure we get all the finer details of it correct.' Well, it certainly sounds to me like it was all ready to be done, all ready to be signed, but for this absolute catastrophe of international policy, this brain fart of an idea that we think it would be a good idea to move Australia's embassy to Jerusalem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are right to be concerned about this and to demand that Mr Morrison gets this done and signs the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement before he comes back to Australia. How could he facilitate that? Perhaps by making a quick decision to say, 'Yes, we'll take our bollocks idea about moving Australia's embassy to Jerusalem off the table', and to do so immediately.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I always enjoy making a contribution in these matters when Labor's hypocrisy sits writ large, front and centre. Let's refresh their memory. The last time they even said the word 'Indonesia' from a trade perspective was when they ceased the trade of live cattle into Indonesia, bringing tens of thousands of Australian families to their knees. Many of them have never recovered. Many have been bankrupted. Even more importantly, there was a significant social impact in Indonesia with the loss of such an important source of protein at that time. They didn't really care. They don't care. In fact, I've been here five years and I think that's the first time I've heard Senator Wong even talk about agriculture or trade agreementsânever before. There was .no interest yesterday, the day before, last week, last month or last year. They're embarrassed, because we all know what happened under Labor with their attempts to bring to a closeâover six or seven years, I think it wasânegotiations for a free trade agreement with China. Of course, it wasn't until we had an excellent minister in place that we closed that out in less than two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is just complete hypocrisy. The government is well and truly on the record that this agreement is progressing. We're at a point where there's the scrubbing of legal terms. The TPA agreement has to be done in a number of languages. We're checking it. We're going very steadily with that job, as you would expect. Here you are: you'd have us go ahead and sign the document on behalf of this nation without having any regard to the national interests and the responsibilities that come with FTAs. So we just need to remind anybody listening of the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not to do with a delay in a free trade agreement. It has nothing to do with that. It's not to do with the consideration of the location of the embassy in Israel, which is under due consideration. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that a decision will be taken before Christmas. I can almost hear the bells of Santa Claus. It's not as if it's been delayed for 12 months, two years or three years. This is simply about one thing: Prime Minister Morrison is obviously biting significantly into your polling around Mr Shorten. That's what this is all about. You have to concentrate. You don't stand up in this place during question time or any other time wanting to have a serious conversation about serious matters. You don't want to talk about the economy, because you can't, of course. Australians break out in a giggle when you start to talk about the economy. You don't want to talk about employment, because of the sterling figures that have been produced by this coalition, a major contribution made by Mr Morrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are frightened of Mr Morrison. It is as clear as the nose on your face. Every time you're in here talking about it, you're trying to peg back some country you've lost. Well, I'll tell you this: I agree you ought to be frightened, because as I move around my electorate of Queensland I'm starting to get very strong reports. They say: 'I like this bloke. I trust this bloke.' They've said it hasn't been since John Howard that we've been able to sense what a person is and what they're going to deliver. So I know your polling is showing that. I know Bill is over thereâMr Shorten, I should sayâshaking in his boots at the moment. That's why it's reflected in your strategies in the Senate this week. That's all you've wanted to talked about. You don't want to talk about the important issues of domestic violence. You don't want to talk about other economic initiatives that are being pursued by the government and frustrated by you. You just want to talk about Mr Morrison. You want to dip the paintbrush into a bit of old paint of 15 years ago. You want to talk about a free trade agreement that's progressing very well and will be significant for this countryâprobably one of the most important. You want to talk about a decision that's under review, as it appropriately should be, in relation to the location of our embassy in Israel. You are frightened. It is clear. You would do better to try and make a positive alternative policy narrative than to continue this attack, which is failing you dismally.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  It's another moment, another week and another month when we, as Australians, feel embarrassment under the leadership of Prime Minister Morrison or, indeed, whoever is in the role of leadership in this country under this coalition government. It is another moment, thanks to this government, when we all feel the cringe and the embarrassment, as Australians, of knowing about the mutterings in the Pacific, in the region, of our nearest neighbours, that will filter throughout the diplomatic channels and elsewhereâmutterings about how arrogant we are as a nation when we hear of the thought bubbles that come out of this government and out of this Prime Minister's mouth. Whether it's junking longstanding bipartisan foreign policy, such as the thought-bubble decision of moving the Australian embassy to Jerusalem, or whether it's the rude words of the now environment minister, who has been termed the L-plated environment minister, it leaves Australians in a diplomatic mess. It does not serve Australia's national interests in any way whatsoever.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very rare that I agree with Senator Fierravanti-Wells, the former Minister for International Development and the Pacific. But, having read her opinion piece in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>today, at least there is one senator on that side that does recognise the effects of climate change on the Pacific. She raises that in her opinion piece in some detail, but then she gets to the important point that it is 'regrettable' that the good work that has been done by this government in the Pacific has been damaged by this new, L-plates environment minister in, as we know, that very unfortunate incident with former President of Kiribati Anote Tong. In answers to questions asked by Senator Kitching on this very matter, we did not receive from Senator Cormann anything detailed in relation to thatâor, indeed, how it has damaged our relationship with the Pacific. That has not been the only thing, of course, that has damaged our relationship with the Pacific. The decision by the government to not even have the Prime Minister attend the Pacific Islands Forum meeting on Nauru was another embarrassing and short-sighted decision. Former President Tong said in a recent interview, about Minister Price:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Obviously she needs to learn a great deal more about the world around her â¦ If she came to Kiribati, I would be happy to show her what we do. Maybe she could begin to understand â¦ and be less arrogant about it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it shows very clearly how arrogant we are perceived to be by the region, and rightly so, after that minister's comments on the night in question.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it doesn't just stop there, but it needs to stop. Whether it's in relation to the Pacific or whether it's in relation to Indonesia, it needs to stop. We need to stop, straightaway, this undiplomatic language and these stupid decisionsâthese thought-bubble decisionsâthat have damaged our relationship with our nearest neighbours. But, instead, what do we have? We have Senator Abetz going on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News </span>today and undermining even further our relationship with Indonesia. Well, we have all had enough. We have all had enough of the embarrassment and the cringing we feel when we hear these former ministers, current ministers, ministers on L-plates, new prime ministers, former prime ministers or whatever revolving-door positions those on the other side are in todayâ</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The differences between warming by 1Â½ degrees and warming by two degreesâor indeed four degrees, as we are on track to have without drastic changeâare worlds apart. It is the difference between having one of the world's most incredible natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef, and losing it. It's the difference between the occasional bushfire and permanent bushfires, as we are seeing right now in California. It's the difference between a country in occasional drought and a country that is in permanent drought and has to drastically change the way its agricultural sector works. Of course, if we head towards four degrees, the planet as we know it will be virtually uninhabitable. A four-degree temperature rise would wipe out so much biodiversity, the consequences of which are unforeseeable. The scientists are telling us we have 12 years left to rein it in. I say that again: we have 12 years. Australia doesn't have another decade to waste on the climate wars. We don't have it. If we're going to get this country back from the brink of disaster, if we are going to be able to hand over a planet that's inhabitable to future generations, we have to act now and we have to act with urgency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decade started with such great promise. We had Kevin Rudd, who said it was the great moral challenge of our time. He was right, but he turned it into a weapon to try to use against the coalition. He insisted on going it alone. He refused to negotiate with the Greens or the crossbench and we ended up with a climate policy that was designed to appease the coalition party room, not to do the job. It took Kevin Rudd being rolled by Julia Gillard and the emergence of multiparty government to get the job done. We saw an emissions trading scheme that was designed as a result of cooperative government, where progressive Independents, the Labor Party and the Greens worked together to implement a price on carbon, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Do you know what happened during that time of the carbon price? Economic growth went up by 4.7 per cent while the carbon price was in place. Pollution went down by 8.1 per cent. It was a scheme that was working and that was doing the job. Then Tony Abbott came along. He came along and wrecked it. It helped that the Labor Party tore themselves apart over their leadership turmoil. We saw the carbon price eventually repealed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But do you know what? The business community, the scientific community and, indeed, the Australian community are saying now to both sides of politics: 'The time for procrastinating is over. We need action. We want you to ensure that you do what you can to make sure we have a chance of handing over a planet that our children can enjoy.' The work needs to start now. We've of course put our road map to the Labor Party. We know the government's a lost cause. We know that they are dominated by climate deniers. We know that it is a party that brought down its own Prime Minister because he was going to implement a modest change to the energy system here in Australia and it still wouldn't accept it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we said to the Labor Party: 'Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past. Let's ensure that we work together to put in place a price on carbon so that we can make sure that this country plays its part in doing what it can to reverse climate damage.' Unfortunately, the signs aren't good. They're not good. We know that Bill Shorten has already walked away from his own policy of an emissions intensity scheme, and it looks like he's going to adopt a policy that wasn't even able to get through the coalition party roomâthe National Energy Guaranteeâa policy that's been designed to appease the climate deniers, not to do the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for action has never been greater. We are on the precipice. The Great Barrier Reef is dying. Huge swathes of Australia are in drought. Our Pacific island neighbours are losing their homes. The window in which we are able to act is shrinking, and it's shrinking fast. It's a few years, at best. The good news is that if we get it right we'll transform Australiaâclean air, clean water, a 21st century transport system, clean energy, more jobs, more investment and energy independence. We could be exporting renewable energy through hydrogen to the world. It's a huge challenge, but we're up for it. We're up for it because we've got no choice.</span>

                </a>  I appreciate the Senate providing me the opportunity to respond to the personal statement by Senator Molan where he claimed that I have misrepresented him. I do this reluctantly. I don't intend engaging in duelling personal statements with Senator Molan. But I do note, as Senator Carr said this morning, that there is a longstanding convention to advise senators if you are going to use a personal statement to attack a fellow senator. I have advised Senator Molan that I will be making this personal statement. Senator Molan ignored that convention this morning. Regardless of this, I stand by my statements in relation to Senator Molan defending Woolworths at the expense of exploited and vulnerable cleaners in Woolworths stores. Anyone who reads <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> in its entirety, and not the selected extract that Senator Molan dealt with this morning, would understand my response and the reasons I responded the way I did. Senator Molan tried to lead evidence from the Fair Work Ombudsman that Woolworths did not benefit from the exploitation of contract cleaners in Woolworths stores. This is wrong, and the tactic failed when the Fair Work Ombudsman gave Senator Molan a lesson in worker exploitation and pyramid subcontracting.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Molan then asserted that if I wrote to Woolworths in relation to the issue it would be an intimidatory move. Senator Molan then accused me of grandstanding and using moral persuasion to threaten people, meaning Woolworths, to publicly expose them. Senator Molan then tried to distance Woolworths from any obligation, moral or financial, in relation to the wage theft that had taken place, by telling Senator O'Neill that Woolworths had no obligation and it's the contractors and subcontractors who had the obligation. This is a morally bankrupt position from Senator Molan.</span>

Road safety is a key priority of this government. No-one should be killed or seriously injured on our roads. The government commends the work of Mr Peter Frazer in his tireless advocacy in the promotion of road safety across the country. The government commissioned an independent inquiry into the effectiveness of the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020, which was released in September. The government will continue to work with key road safety stakeholders, all levels of government and the parliament. To this end, the Deputy Prime Minister recently wrote to all members of parliament and senators and chaired a discussion with his state transport ministerial counterparts.</span>

                  </a>  The Liberal-National government provides considerable support to people of all ages with diabetes, including the subsidy of essential medicines like insulin through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and of diabetes-related products through the National Diabetes Services Scheme. Expenditure on PBS medicines for the treatment of diabetes was $545 million in 2016-17 and expenditure on products for the management of diabetes supplied through the NDSS was over $200 million in 2017-18. In addition, the government is investing $54 million from 2016 to 2020-21 to provide fully subsidised continuous glucose-monitoring products to eligible children and young people under 21 years of age living with type 1 diabetes. The Department of Health is undertaking an evaluation of the FreeStyle Libre product to consider its suitability for subsidisation through the NDSS, and the government is awaiting the outcome.</span>

But, to give you an idea, we've had the Finkel review, we've had the ACCC review, we've had a Senate select committee into the resilience of electricity infrastructure in a warming world, chaired by Senator Hanson-Young, we've had the numerous reports leading to the final detailed design for the National Energy Guarantee by the Energy Security Board, we've had the House Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy doing an inquiry into the modernising of Australia's electricity grid and we've had the AEMC and the Climate Change Authority doing an inquiry into delivering affordable, secure and lower emissions power, and I've got a number of others here. We just can't see the value for money in the conduct of another inquiry. What will it educe that has not already been educed? We don't need a further inquiry into electricity; we actually just need some action.</span>

                  </a>  The gender pay gap has been trending down under the Liberal-National government. Based on ABS data, the gender pay gap has fallen to 14.5 per cent, the lowest percentage on recordâfalling by 2.7 percentage points under the Liberal-National government. The government has provided an additional $8 million to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to enable them to increase the scope of their gender pay gap reporting from around 40 per cent of the workforce to around 75 per cent of the workforce. The information provided by WGEA to employers provides them with a clear picture, enabling them to address pay disparities in the workplace. The United Kingdom has recently imposed a requirement for companies with 250 employees or more to report their gender pay gap publicly. We will consider how effective this is as further data becomes available.</span>

                  </a>  Labor is sympathetic with the sentiment behind this motion but does not support it as originally drafted or as amended. Labor notes that the ABC charter sets out international broadcasting as a function of the ABC and that the ABC Act prescribes the providers of Commonwealth funded international broadcasting services. Labor notes that the Liberal government's short-sighted cuts to the ABC and the dismantling of the Australia Network have undermined both the ABC and Australia's presence in the region. Labor notes that the government's 'soft power' review and the review of Australian broadcasting services in the Asia-Pacific are yet to conclude. Labor's policy positions on international broadcasting and the Pacific will be considered through Labor's usual caucus process.</span>

                  </a>  This motion calls for the money that the government has now promised for broadcasting in the Asia-Pacific to be directed to the ABC. If we are going to be spending public money on broadcasting in the region for the purposes of soft diplomacy, it should be done through our public broadcaster. It was a mistake by Mr Abbott to slash the Australia Network and the ABC's contract at that time. There was obviously some acknowledgement in the government that that was a mistake. Fix it properly. Refund the ABC and let them get on with their job.</span>

                  </a>  It's very disappointing that this motion about Japanese whaling has been denied formality today. This is not a complex foreign matter; this is a very simple matter. The Japanese whaling fleet left two nights ago from Japan, heading to the Southern Ocean. The Japanese Prime Minister is coming to Australia this Friday. We're rolling out the red-carpet-engagement treatment for the Japanese Prime Minister. It's a friendship/close allies visit to talk about closer regional ties, defence and national security.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue. There is a massive object in the room that no-one is talking about, and it's called a minke whale. There are 333 of them that the Japanese harpoon fleets are heading into the Southern Ocean to kill this summer. Why aren't we doing something about it? I think that this motion reflects what most Australians feel on this issue, and this chamber has thumbed its nose at the sentiment of the Australian people.</span>

                  </a>  Contrary to Senator Whish-Wilson's simple view of the issue before us, the government does believe that this is a complex foreign policy matter. Australia strongly opposes all forms of commercial and so-called scientific whaling. We have expressed our concern at the return of the Japanese fleet to the Southern Ocean. We will continue our efforts at the International Whaling Commission to promote whale conservation and our non-lethal whale research to prove that such scientific whaling is untenable. Our bilateral relations with Japan are extremely important to us and we continue to raise this at the highest levels with Japan.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the issue:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Putting local workers first, including cracking down on 457 visas; using Australian grade steel; and protecting local manufacturers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what has happened in recent years. This government drove one of the highest skilled industries out of the country, the vehicle manufacturing industry. All over the world, countries queue up to try to get investment in high skill, high-tech manufacturing, yet what did this government do? It drove them out of the country. That has left workers in South Australia with no jobs or with jobs that pay far less. It has condemned workers to low-paying work in areas of South Australia. This government is pathetic when it comes to these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of the old 457 visas, they've simply changed the name but everyone knows what the visa is. A report by Ms Bassina Farbenblum and Dr Laurie Berg entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Wage theft in silence: why migrant workers do not recover their unpaid wages in Australia </span>found that the majority of migrant workers are paid well below the minimum wage and only a few take the opportunity to try to recover the wages they are owed. Amongst international students and backpackers who acknowledge that they had been underpaid, the overwhelming majority suffered wage theft in silence. Less than one in 10 took action to recover the wages they were owed, only three per cent of underpaid participants contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman and well over half of them recovered none of their unpaid wages. Participants selected a range of rational reasons why they had not sought to address their underpayment: a quarter indicated fear of possible immigration consequences, close to half reported that they did not know what to do and many believed that they would not be successful. We considered this report in the references committee inquiry that was precipitated by Senator Molan backing Woolworths against cleaners in Woolworths stores. This report demonstrates that an epidemic of wage theft has taken place across this country during the coalition's time as a governmentâhopefully that won't be much longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area that was brought to my attention recently was the CFMEU dispute down at the Royal Hobart Hospital, where site induction training was conducted by the Master Builders Association, the MBA, which, all the time, backs these mad people that are running this muppet government. The CFMEU brought attention to a case of over 100 Chinese plasterers working at the Royal Hobart Hospital site. When the CFMEU came across them, those workers had gone unpaid for nine weeks. Workers' safety should not be left exposed on any site. Most of these workers spoke little or no English, and the site safety induction was delivered in English, courtesy of the Master Builders Association. The MBA took money from contractors to deliver the induction to workers who could not speak English and delivered that induction in the English language. The good news is that the CFMEU made sure those workers received back pay and were being paid properly. They recovered $1.132 million in entitlements. Good on the CFMEU!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's ABCC had done nothing at the Royal Hobart Hospital site. They'd been on the site nearly every day and had done nothing to help those workers. It just shows the bias in this organisation, the ABCC. It just shows that they don't care. They are simply an organisation set up by the coalition to attack the CFMEU and building workers. It is just outrageous. While Senator Cash and her fellow muppets are making it harder for unions to represent their members, employers and their associations are getting away with not paying workers their proper pay and delivering safety training in a language that the workers don't understand. How dopey is this? Rather than exploiting vulnerable workers on temporary work visas, employers need to be employing and training more Australian workers. Instead of punishing unions, the government should be working with unions to ensure workplaces are fair and safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got Senator Cash, now a disgraced minister who misled the Senate on five occasions and whose advisers actually breached the law and advised the press of an AFP raid on the AWU. This is a failed minister. This is a minister who, when she was finally caught out on this, turned on young women in the Leader of the Opposition's office and accused them of all sorts of crazy, unsavoury things that had no basis in fact. This minister is a disgrace. For this government to have Senator Cash sitting in the cabinet room is an example of how bad they are, how devoid they are of talent and how devoid they are of people who can do a job for the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's crocodile tears over skill shortages and Senator Cash's crocodile tears are disingenuous, because this government has failed to deliver anything over the last five years. If Senator Cash and the coalition paid more attention to improving vocational education, instead of attacking workers, attacking their unions and attacking each other, we might be in a better position in this country. We would not be in the mess we are in and we would not have this government that the former Prime Minister called 'mad' and the current Prime Minister declared were 'muppets'. This is a terrible government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the draconian ABCC Building Code, unions and employers can't reach agreement to guarantee the employment of apprentices. On the one hand, they're saying there are no apprentices being employed and, on the other hand, they're stopping unions and employers reaching agreements that would give young kids in this country a fair go and give them an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. And what's the latest effort? At the same time as the OECD is reporting that Australia can't access global value chains due to the lack of skills in this country, the latest effort is for Senator Cash and the Prime Minister to cave in to Senator Hanson on this so-called bush wage. It's modelled on a thought bubble from Senator Hanson. A thought bubble from Senator Hanson isn't very big, let me tell you. We've got a situation where $60 million is going to be allocated to employers who have no record of looking after apprentices and who have not employed apprentices in the past. This is going to be at the expense of companies in the bush that have been employing apprentices for years. This is a nonsense. In Senator Cash's own state, there are 9,615 fewer apprentices, including more than 7,000 in trade occupations. This is a government that doesn't get it. When you suck up to Senator Hanson, when you suck up to a racist party like One Nationâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the second MPI in two days. Yesterday I started my MPI contribution by pointing out that, even though the MPI came from those opposite, it reflected a number of ticks for this government on a whole range of issues where this government continues to get on with the job and to deliver for the Australian people. As we look at this MPI, we're in the same place. We're talking about Australian workers. We're talking about cracking down on 457 visa holders. We're talking about the use of Australian steel and protecting local manufacturers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start with the last one firstâprotecting local manufacturers. 'Protection' is a very dangerous word, but the best way of protecting local manufacturers is actually giving them the chance to thrive and to grow in a growing economy and in growing export markets. What have we seen in the ABS statistics in recent times for manufacturing jobs in Australia? After a long period of structural decline, we've actually seen, according to the ABS, employment in manufacturing on the increase over the last 12 months. In the year to August, we've seen some 306,000 new jobs in the manufacturing sector, in fact, representing an increase of 2Â½ per cent. Manufacturing jobs surged by 86,000-odd in the last 12 months alone. One in five positions created since 2007 have actually been in manufacturing. So the policies of this government in our management of the domestic economy but also in boosting international trade through a series of free trade agreements has given Australian manufacturers the chance to succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just go through the recent agreement that's currently before this place, one that Labor seems to be walking away from. That is the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement. PAFTA does a number of things of advantage. I'm very keen on some of the agricultural changes, but that's not what I'm going to focus on here today. I'm going to look at the changes to machinery imports. Peru is an economy which is seeking to increasingly utilise its natural resources, be they agricultural or mineral. It wants access to high-quality agricultural and mining equipment, and that is an area where Australia has some specific international advantages. So, under the Peru free trade agreement, which is still before this place, some 95 per cent of tariffsâtariffs of up to 17 per centâwould be eliminated on it entering into force and all remaining tariffs would be eliminated within five years. There are agricultural machinery manufacturers and mining machinery manufacturers in Australia that would benefit extraordinarily from that. Through that, we would see the manufacturing sector in Australia continuing to grow and continuing to provide those long-term, high-quality jobs that all those on this side of the chamber want to see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steel is vitally important to the Australian economy. It's a very important part of our manufacturing industry. It's very important for the construction sector, for engineering, for agriculture and for the mining sector. It contributes, in fact, around $11 billion to Australia's GDP every year. The steel industry is, in every sense of the words, a nation builder and is a massive contributor to our economy. More than 90,000 Australians are employed in the steel industry and related industries, and many more are employed indirectly in downstream industries that utilise steel. So this government certainly wants to see the steel industry continue in Australia and continue to supply both Australia and the world with a high-quality product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we'll move on to the management of the 457 visa program. The government has abolished the 457 visa program because it isn't meeting our economic needs at this time. This was done to put Australian jobs first. There is a new visa category, the temporary skill shortage visa, which was implemented on 18 March 2018. Labor and the unions destroyed the integrity of Australia's skilled migration program when they were last in power. We are cleaning up Labor's mess with the changes that we have made to the 457 program. Workers from overseas with particular skills are required in the Australian economy. Coming from Western Australia, I very well remember the pressures in the Western Australian economy from a lack of skilled workers during the mining construction boom. It was essential for Western Australia to take advantage of the opportunities that then existed. We had a pathway to bring in skilled workers from elsewhere, and in some parts of the economy those pathways are still required where there are genuine skill shortages, and that is what the new temporary skills shortage visa will fill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the reform in this area, the coalition government tore up Labor's expansive skill list of 651 occupations and, in its place, this government is putting in place an evidence based list of occupations that reflect the genuine skills needed in our economy. This list is updated every six months. The six-monthly updates are based on research from the Department of Jobs and Small Business. In accordance with their advice, occupations are added or removed to ensure that it is responsive to the needs of the Australian labour market. In that way, it protects Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, the 457 program actually expanded with the addition of 40,000 foreign workers. So their rhetoric in this area, the rhetoric we just heard a few minutes ago from Senator Cameron, is a complete nonsense and a complete rewriting of history. This is a government that is getting on with the job. It is delivering for Australians by boosting the economy and by creating pathways for the high-quality produce of Australia to get to the rest of the world so our high-quality Australian manufacturers can export their products to the rest of the world. That is why this government is so committed to continuing to finding new pathways to marketsâthings like the Indonesia trade agreement that's currently under discussion, the Peru free trade agreement that's currently before this place and the TPP-11 which has recently been passed by this place. In this way, we see that those manufacturing jobs will continue to grow and continue to be a very importantâin fact, an increasingly importantâpart of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As economies transition, as older jobs disappear and newer jobs flow into the market, there is the potential for dislocation. It is a legitimate role of government to help with that dislocation, but we must not try to pander to the protectionist policies of the past that have failed over and over and over again. This is, sadly, as I have stated in this place before, the path that those opposite seem to be going down. There was a consensus that trade was of benefit to the economy and of benefit to all economiesâof benefit to the world. It increases our government-to-government links, it increases our business-to-business links and it increases our individual-to-individual links. It allows people to move more easily across borders to take advantage of opportunities and it allows for the free flow of goods and services, as much as practicable in a world where the idea of trade has become somewhat problematic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen an antagonism towards trade across the political spectrum, and I think this is something that is very dangerous for the planet. When we start getting into trade wars, I think it offers very real risks that can lead elsewhere. The best way of keeping the peace globally is to make sure we have a highly integrated economy where everybody trades with as many people as possible. I think it is vitally important that we continue to grow the Australian economy and that we continue to grow our manufacturing export sector. In doing so we link our economy to the rest of the world in as many ways as possible. That is the path to the jobs of the future and to getting as many Australians into work as possibleâproviding the high-quality jobs of the futureâand that is the path this government continues to proceed down.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  As an Australian nationalist, I make no apologies for being strong on jobs for Australians first, and that definitely includes apprenticeships. Labor and the coalition on the other hand have quite literally opened the floodgates to foreign workers on visa schemes that have sold out the unemployed and the under-unemployed right across this country. Labor sold out workers in this country by establishing a little-known category called the 400 visa. It was a category that had very little oversight and that gave approval to foreign workers, in as little as 24 hours, to come and take Australian jobs. Hundreds of thousands of workers were employed under the 400 visa category, costing long-term unemployed Australians and university graduates finishing their studies a chance of employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the 457 visa program, where, again under Labor, the floodgates were opened to foreigners to come and take hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. When Labor lost government in 2013, they were letting 130,000 foreign workers into Australia to take jobs like ship's engineers, ship's officers, radio journalists, magistrates, park rangers, zookeepers, and flight attendants. They are just some of the jobs Labor allowed to go to foreigners. Thankfully, the number of foreign workers on the 457 visa program dropped by 60,000 last year. One Nation was largely responsible for cuts to over 200 of those job categories, some of which I mentioned before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that ACTU Secretary Sally McManus said in July this year that there are 1.4 million visa holders with working rights in Australia. That's disgusting. I have no doubt that these people are hard workers, but the point of my disgust comes down to Australians wanting a job. They have to compete with over one million overseas workers. Both Labor and the coalition have hoodwinked voters in this country. They talk tough on jobs, but they are quietly undermining the unemployed and the future youth, who will one day join the search for a job in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to bring to the Senate's attention another real problem that both Labor and the coalition have failed to recognise. The Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations, Kelly O'Dwyer, last year admitted in a <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> interview that 400,000 ABNs were issued to people on visas who are not allowed to work in this country. Australians find that to be so typical of government departmentsâthey don't talk to each other. So, on top of the 1.4 million work visas issued to foreigners, we have a further 400,000 taking jobs from Aussies under the guise of small-business ownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note this matter of public importance also highlights the need to protect local manufacturers and Australian grade steel. It's a bit bloody tough to protect Australian grade steel when the Greens, supported by Labor, are constantly trying to shut down mining in this country. You see, Australian-grade steel requires Australian coal, particularly the high-quality coal from my home state of Queensland, along with the high-grade iron ore from my One Nation colleague's home state of Western Australia. When I stayed in camp with 800 miners in Moranbah only a few weeks ago, I learned that the majority of Central Queensland coalmines are producing coking coal, which is one of two key ingredients for Australian-grade steel. Australian coking coal is mixed with Western Australian iron ore to form the best steel in the world. That's why we're exporting these two commodities to countries like China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. They want their bridges and buildings to stand the test of time. But, if the Greens and Labor team up again at the next election with their mutual preference deals, we'll be thrust back to building straw-and-mud homes. The key to using Australian-grade steel and protecting local manufacturers is to stop demonising coal and other mining throughout this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for Senator Cameron's approach to my policy on getting apprenticeships in this country, I've done more for the youth of this nation in apprenticeship schemes than Labor have ever done. If it means that rural and regional areas get the chance for their youth to get into apprenticeship schemes then so be it. If you want to refer to it as sucking upâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  There is only one party in this place that can be trusted to put the interests of Australian workers first, and that's the Australian Labor Party. So let's look at this issue of putting workers first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the issue of 457 visas. This is an area which this government has completely mucked up. We know that last year the then Turnbull government rushed to announce the crackdown on 457 visas in around April, and they did that without consulting affected stakeholders. The changes and the subsequent revisions to the skilled occupation lists sent waves of uncertainty through the business, innovation and education sectors. We know that, within Mr Dutton's own department, officials were describing the skilled migration changes as a dog's breakfast. So this is a government that can't be trusted in relation to the issue of 457 visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this is an issue particularly in Central and Northern Queensland. Our candidate in the seat of Flynn, Mr Zac Beers, has been very active in this particular space, conducting roundtables with our shadow minister for immigration, Shayne Neumann. That happened in April. We're particularly concerned about the reports that, in the solar farm area, there are unskilled workers going about on backpacker visas. These are not specialised workers, and they shouldn't be used to undertake work that should be completed by qualified professionals. This appears to be going on at the moment. So we've got an out-of-touch LNP that's constantly fought against labour market testing, which ensures that Australian workers are given the first shot at local jobs before temporary work visas are made available here. We've seen that Mr O'Dowd, the current member for Flynn, has voted against putting important labour-market-testing conditions into legislation, selling out local workers in Gladstone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the issue of labour hire, another issue that impacts particularly in Central Queensland. If you're listening for policies on the other side to deal with this issue of unfair labour hire practices, you'd be very disappointed, because there is not a peep from the government on this issue of unfair labour hire practices. Compare this with Labor. We have come up with the 'same jobs, same pay' policy, which goes a long way towards addressing this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Labor's candidate in the seat of Flynn is out there talking to workers who are the victims of unfair labour hire practices. He's been through places like Gladstone, Biloela, Moura, Blackwater and the Central Highlands, finding that these areas are being crippled by the atrocious behaviour of big companies that are taking advantage of the broken industrial relations system that we have, which allows casual labour hire to be a replacement for permanent jobs. Mr Beers has said that across Flynn he's heard stories from workers who have been made redundant, losing their permanent jobs and being offered their positions back as casual labour hire employees at significantly lower rates and with absolutely no job security or certainty. He's also heard from workers who have literally had to wait by the phone, afraid to miss a call from their employer to come in for a shift because, if they don't answer that call, they know that they'll be taken off the roster for weeks to come. He's also heard from workers who have been forced to accept unsafe and potentially life-threatening working conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, in Central Queensland, if you're dependent on a labour hire job and you speak up about safety issues, you can quite easily lose your job. It's an absolute disgrace that this government has stood by and allowed this practice of labour hire to infect workplaces around the country. The misuse of labour hire is destroying Central Queensland communitiesâlet's not make any bones about that. This is a practice that must come to an end. Only a Shorten Labor government is committed to stamping out this insidious practice and restoring fairness to workers across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come to the issue of manufacturing, let's never forget in this place that it was those opposite who destroyed the automotive manufacturing industry. They walked away from it. Every country around the world worth its salt that has a motor vehicle manufacturing industry puts in some degree of subsidy. But this government would not support our sovereign capacity to manufacture motor vehicles. We on this side have a strong plan that will ensure that local manufacturing firms and jobs continue.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, you may have heard the saying 'leading with your chin'. This motion from Senator Urquhart says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Labor Party to put this motion forward, is leading with your chin, for sure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the facts here. The motion talks about 'putting local workers first, including cracking down on 457 visas'. There are no 457 visasâthey've been abolished. But there were 457s. When Labor was in power there were 40,000 more people working in Australia on 457 visas than there were when we abolished the 457s. When those opposite were in government there were more people working on 457 visas than when we took over government and abolished the 457 visas and brought in the new system, the temporary skill shortage visas. The new temporary skill shortage visa was implemented on 18 March 2018. Labor and the unions destroyed the integrity of Australia's skilled migration program, just like they destroyed the integrity of our borders. Those opposite cannot be trusted on their border policies, nor can they be trusted to run this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of our reform package, the coalition tore up Labor's expansive list of 651 occupations listed on the 457 visa, which had opened up Australia's labour market and permanent resident programs to occupations such as potters, goat herdersâI'm sure there'd be a big demand for goat herdersâand cattery workers. In its place, the government established an evidence based list of occupations that reflects the genuine skill needs of our economy. I want to emphasise the point that, under Labor, there were more people coming into Australia on 457 visas and working than there were under the coalition governmentâyet they are complaining about the 457 visa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion also talks about 'using Australian grade steel'. I couldn't agree more. The steel industry is vital and employs many, many people. The steel industry, and our incredibly high-quality steel, is worth billions of dollars here. In fact, it contributes $11 billion to Australia's GDP each year. The steel industry is a nation builder and a significant contributor to our economy. More than 90,000 Australians are employed in the steel industry and many more are employed indirectly in downstream industries that utilise the steel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we have Labor saying that we've got to look after our steel and buy local steel, but who is against coalmining? We know who is against coalmining. Don't shake your head, Senator Watt. It depends where Mr Shorten is talking. If he is in Melbourne and talking at a by-election he is against coalmining. You know that you will be hamstrung by the Greens. You know that the Greens are the tail wagging the dog and they want to shut down every mine in Australia.</span>

                  </a>  My apologies, Mr Acting Deputy President. They've changed seats. My sincere apologies. Senator Ketterâinstead of Senator Wattâhere you are opposing coalmining, but how do we produce steel? Out of coking coal. We have high-quality coking coal, some of the best in the world, and the steel we produce is magnificent steel. As I said, there are 90,000 people employed, plus a huge number of people in employment on the downstream side.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You want to keep manufacturing here. Well, the problem we've got in Australia is the cost of doing business here compared to the rest of the world. What's one of the main costs? One of the main costs is electricity. Remember 2010, when Labor was in power? 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'</span>

                  </a>  Yes, I think Senator Brown remembers that famous quote: 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Of course, along came the member for New England, Mr Tony Windsor, and he stamped his foot and said, 'I'll get behind you on one condition: that a multiparty climate change committee be formed.' And what did we get? We got a tax of $9 billion a year and growingânine thousand million dollars in tax. It put electricity prices up. What does that do for manufacturing here? It means we are uncompetitive.</span>

                  </a>  I think, Mr Acting Deputy President, the truth is starting to hurt Senator Carol Brown. I don't think she's enjoying what I'm saying, but she's going to have to sit there and listen carefully and take every word in, because what I'm saying is the absolute truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you've put the cost of doing business up. I see it all the time. I've seen it at an abattoir in Inverell. Where they used to pay $40,000 a week for electricity, they're now paying $70,000 a week because of things such as the renewable energy target, which, thank goodness, the coalition did reduce from 41,000 gigawatts to 33,000 gigawattsâand it should have been reduced more. There's nothing wrong with renewable energy, on one condition: it competes on a level playing field. We see the wind towers being built now in the plain between Inverell and Glen Innes. That's fine, but there's one problem: for every wind tower that spins eight hours a day, 365 days a year, anyone who's hooked to the gridâthe pensioner, the widow, the business, the familyâpays $700,000 a year to that one wind turbine before they buy one watt of electricity. I think that is very unfair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they did in South Australia was put these windmills everywhere. Where I grew up, at Jamestown, the hills are covered with them. Of course, because of the subsidy, they can sell electricity cheaply. What did they do? They sent the coal-fired power station at Port Augusta broke. It was literally blown up. What happened then? The lights went out. The lights went out because the stupid subsidies sent the reliable source of electricity broke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the crazy attitude of many in here that Australia is going to dominate the world, rule the world and change the world. They had a column in the Australian Hotel a few weeks agoâ<span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper, sorry; though I have been to the Australian Hotel before today, I can tell youâthat highlighted the number of coal-fired generation plants being constructed around the world. Guess what they're going to burn in those coal-fired generating plants? They're going to burn coal. Do they burn the more efficient coal from Australia or do they burn the second-rate brown coal from Indonesia, China or wherever? The Greens and many others will say: 'Don't have a coalmine in Australia. Don't burn more efficient coal, with higher energy and less CO2 production. Burn the rubbish coal and, hence, shut down the mining here and take away our wealth and our jobs.' That is the crazy hypocrisy of this whole situation. As Dr Finkel, our Chief Scientist, said, we can cut out all our emissions, 1.3 per cent of the world's CO2, and it will have virtually no effect on the planet whatsoever, but we're paying for it and paying dearly. I return to the cost of doing business. If we want to keep manufacturing here, we need to keep the costs down, and electricity is one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't want to see foreigners working here. Mr Acting Deputy President, it was 15 September 2008, a while back now, when I made my maiden speech to this chamber. I said then that some of the young ones in Australia who are fit and capable of working need a touch on the backside with a cattle prodânot literally, metaphoricallyâto get them off their butts and get them to work. When I was a young fella, if you didn't work it was a shame. You were shamed in your community. We didn't have enough land for me to work when I threw in my scholarship at university in and came home to the farm, so I took up shearing sheep. It's not an easy job. There's probably none tougher. I remember my first day shearing. I worked my butt off for eight hours and crawled out on all fours. I had shorn 32 sheep for the day. I thought, 'What a great future I have in this industry!' Anyway, I got better as time went on. I then went driving trucks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the young ones, the healthy ones, need to get to work. Our abattoir at Inverell employs 800 people. It was started by the great man John McDonald and his family, who kicked off the abattoir after it had closed down about 20 years ago. Locals were employed. They actually ran a bus out to areas of unemployment such as Tyngin. People came to work for the first couple of days. Then they didn't come to work. Australians came to work andâguess what?âthey failed the grog test. They failed the drug test. They got the spear. They were offered a job, they had a job and they wouldn't play by the rules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we have now? We have many Filipino and Brazilian workers there because we can't get others to work there. It is all right to say, 'Let's have the locals working,' but they've got to have a bit of a go. There's nothing wrong with working at abattoirs. It's a great industry that relies on exports and export income. It has great local jobs and puts great money in the local community. So it's all right to say, 'Preserve our jobs,' but the locals are going to have to work. In many countries, as Senator Gichuhi pointed out about where she comes from in her maiden speech, if you don't work, you don't get paid. Luckily we do in Australia, but that money should be there to help people along to the next job. For those who refuse to work, we have a real problem because some are simply not capable of working and we need to keep business costs down.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANNING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  This MPI raises a number of very important matters of great concern to me. As I said in my speech opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, there has been a long list of so-called free trade deals, going back to the disastrous Lima agreement of 1975, which have crippled our manufacturing industries and, in the process, shed many hundreds of thousands of Aussie jobs. It seems very ironic that this MPI would be put up by the Labor Party today when, only a few weeks ago, it supported the latest TPP agreement which did exactly what it is now lamenting. Australia's self-proclaimed 'Fabius Maximus', former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, has to rate as the No. 1 enemy of manufacturing industry and jobs, signing a trade agreement that had the explicit purpose of killing Australian jobs and transferring manufacture to the Third World. Whitlam slashed tariffs and, overnight, destroyed whole industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before Whitlam, around 70 per cent of the Australian workforce were employed in decent, well-paid jobs in manufacturing, but now that number has fallen to a tiny fraction. The working-class voter who naively put Whitlam into power in 1972 little realised that his radical Left interventionist vision cared nothing for the prosperity of them and their families. Those who cared about their jobs, the jobs of Aussie workersâand I know there are many in the Labor Party today who genuinely doârealised that trade treaties that allow cheap foreign products to be dumped on our markets simply destroy our own industries. They realised that allowing foreign workers to flood into this country on 457 visas and the like only takes jobs from Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foreign worker visas are a Trojan Horse not only stealing hundreds of thousands of jobs from Aussies every year but providing a conduit for a flood of Third World immigrants. Foreign worker visas should not be issued at the expense of Australian jobs. There should be a very stringent public interest test in which employers seeking foreign labour should be required to prove that the position genuinely cannot be filled by an Australian. These visas should be of a very limited time with a subsequent period of ineligibility for reapplication after completion. At their conclusion, those who have had foreign worker visas should be compelled to return to their countries of origin with no entitlement to jump the queue for immigration selection.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of great concern to me that neither the Liberals nor the Labor Party appear to have any industrial policies. How can we ever hope to address the decline of Australian manufacturing under these circumstances? As I set out in my maiden speech, I do not just want to protect our remaining residual manufacturing; I want a program to reindustrialise Australia. However, we don't need to reinvent the wheel on this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Konrad Adenauer's postwar German economic miracle, which ultimately led to both high wages and high profits for companies, is a model for the reindustrialisation of Australia and a means to return to widespread employment in secondary industry. Adenauer's approach of rebuilding manufacturing as a national collaborative effort between private capital, government and unions provides a means to create sustainable industries, free of the adversarial industrial disputes that bedevilled our past. Following the German model, the boards of these new industries would have positions reserved for union representatives who would have full access to profit-and-loss accounts and would then be able to realistically negotiate wage levels, based on the actual profitability of the companies. As occurred in postwar Germany, wages would be expected to be low on start-up but then would grow with rising profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By following this model, collaborative manufacturing would be built up, concurrently serving the interests of labour and capital. Supported by some import restrictions and limited temporary tariffs, and a blanket policy for government procurement of only locally made goods, Australia could be reindustrialised along efficient, cooperative lines, re-creating our national industrial independence and balancing our economic development through import substitution. The cooperative nationalist industrial model that I propose would lead to the creation of hundreds of thousands of secure, well-paid jobs in a profitable industry free of industrial disputes that would reassert our economic freedom and our independence as a nation. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Putting local workers first and protecting local manufacturers is a key responsibility of Australian government and can only be done by a government that understands the threats facing workers and manufacturing businesses in Australia, threats this government has shown it simply does not understandâthreats like foreign products, such as steel, being dumped into the Australian market; threats like the use of visas to bring in foreign workers to do jobs that can and should be done by Australians; threats like underinvestment in research and development; and threats like governments procuring goods and services from overseas when there are equal or better Australian alternatives available. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's contempt for manufacturing is demonstrated by the revolving door of ministers for industry. Minister Karen Andrews is the sixth. Under this government, they have a shorter life expectancy than the bogong moth. Minister Andrews' tenure has been marked by her preference for soft media events, rather than meetings with actual stakeholders. Currently, Minister Andrews is asleep at the wheel while crises and urgent calls for action pile up at her door. A perfect example of such a situation is the crisis, on her watch, facing the complementary medicine industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementary medicine manufacturing in Australia has 82 different manufacturing companies employing over 29,000 Australians and paying $170 million annually in salaries. The industry generated $4.9 billion in revenue in 2017 and has nearly doubled in size in the last five years. Much of this growth has come on the back of exports to Asia. This growth is based on Australia's reputation as a clean, safe supplier, endorsed by the 'Australian made' logo. It's an increasingly rare example of Australian manufacturers being able to enjoy some competitive advantage against cheaper overseas rivals. But an unintended outcome of changes to labelling laws has thrown doubt on the industry's right to use the 'Australian made' label, jeopardising the jobs and revenue generated by this industry. This crisis requires firm and decisive action by the minister for industry to find a resolution. So how many stakeholders have managed a meeting with Minister Andrews on this matter? According to our information, it is zero. Perhaps this minister, too, is suffering from what a member of the government described earlier today as 'L-plate syndrome'. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the OECD has made clear, the sustainability of economic growth and prosperity depends on knowledge based economies having a vibrant innovation system. A nation that does not invest in R&amp;D is not investing in its future. The latest annual science, research and innovation budget tables, released last month, confirm there has been a 10 per cent decline in real terms in spending on science, research and innovation during the life of this government. This decline has covered all sectorsâgovernment, universities and businesses both large and small. A Shorten Labor government will aim for three per cent of GDP to be devoted to R&amp;D by 2030. The present level, 1.8 per cent of GDP, is well below the OECD average of 2.3 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The automotive industry is another example of this government's failure. Automotive manufacturing has not only been a major direct employer, especially in South Australia and Victoria, but it has also generated jobs across Australia through its supply chain. Most importantly, this industry always has been the great repository of advanced manufacturing skills in Australia. It's been the great driver of research and development, as leaders of other sectors have long acknowledged, making Australia not just a leading industrial nation but, more importantly, a nation ready for the fourth industrial revolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Australians will not benefit unless government is prepared to invest in Australians, in their skills and in their future. Unfortunately, this government has given up. The former motor vehicle producers know the capability of Australia's engineers and industrial designers. That's why all three have still chosen to retain design and testing centres in Australia. We must not lose this essential core of knowledge and skills and the great talent pool of the former auto supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A small window remains for Australia to fully participate in the technological revolution that is transforming industrial economies across the globe. We don't have to compete with low-wage countries producing manufactured goods for mass markets, but that window is about to close unless there is change in 2019.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I think it's really interesting that this matter of public importance starts with, 'Putting local workers first'. It's interesting because it's obvious. It is core to who we are as a coalition government that we put Australians, their jobs, their work, their freedom and their prosperity first every day of the week. It's a principal role of a government to endeavour always to do what is in the best interests of Australians. That means doing all we can to support Australians to have jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On our side of politics, we believe deeply that the best solutionâthe very best for any individualâis work. Not welfareâwork. There are some in this place who think the solution is to have a big government, promise the earth, give plenty, require little and, in the process, stifle the economic growth that's needed to be able to provide jobs. A constant welfare drip doesn't grow the economy. It doesn't give support to those people in our community who are looking for a job, who are desperately wanting a chance to get ahead, who are proud people wanting to get along without the need for government handouts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax reform and reducing the burden of tax on businesses is key to providing businesses with the capacity to create jobs. When we do that, we are putting local workers first. But, of course, those opposite have been happy to get in the way of efforts to reduce the tax burden on business. They've been happy to hamper the government in its effort to make it as easy as possible for business to grow and to include more and more Australians in that wealth. We've made individual income tax cuts because we know they make a difference to individuals and give them more reward in their pockets for the effort they put into work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another initiative that is fundamental to growing jobs in this country is the negotiation of free trade agreements. Australian manufacturers and producers are well respected around the world for their competitive pricing and the product quality they produce. Removing barriers to trade improves our trading position and leads to more jobs for local workers. In the past year, exports have increased by four per cent, while, importantly, rural exports have increased by 19 per cent. Our landmark agreements with China, Japan, South Korea and, recently, Peru will generate more export opportunities for Australian agriculture, mining, manufacturing and service industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This MPI talks about 457 visas, but the 457 visa program has been cancelled. It ended on 18 March 2018, and it's worth noting that under Labor there were 40,000 457 visas. That's how many were in place at the time that the coalition came to government, and it has taken a coalition government to act to put Australians first in this field. The new temporary skills shortage visa scheme was implemented in March 2018, and it is yet again a case of the coalition cleaning up Labor's mess. In doing so, we have torn up the expansive list of 651 occupations that had opened up Australia's labour market and permanent residence programs to a broad range of options. Instead, we are now focused on what matters, and that is putting Australians and their job opportunities first, putting Australian businesses and their needs first, and always testing the entitlement to go for a visa against this important question: could we get an Australian to do this job? That's what we do every day of the week, because you can always count on the coalition to put the needs of Australian workers first.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  I rise to contribute to this matter of public importance debate about the government's failure to put local workers first and to protect local manufacturing. It is, of course, only the ALP who cares about manufacturing jobs and working peopleâincluding, I would say, working people in the western suburbs of Melbourne. As we know, this is being tested at the moment, with an election on in Victoria.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing that the Greens have chosen not to participate in this debate, but it is perhaps not surprising, because they, like the Liberals, are not truly focused on delivering for Australian workers. Their failure to put local workers and local industries first is, of course, not the only failure by the Greens that we have heard about this week. I am, of course, talking about the complete failure of the Greens to address the toxic culture of violent misogyny that is currently plaguing their party. The New South Wales Greens are in open warfare over the failure of the Greens leadership to take a stand over indecent assault allegations levelled against Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham. Former Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon has condemned Mr Buckingham's response to this complaint and criticised party leaders for failing to call out his shocking behaviour. Current Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi and member for Newtown, Jenny Leong, have called on Mr Buckingham to stand down as a Greens MP. When they are so riven with division and their culture has become so toxic, it is no wonder the Greens are completely incapable of delivering on the things that matter to the Australian people, like gender equality in the workplace and an economy that delivers for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Leader of the Greens in my home state of Victoria was accused of sexist discrimination and sexually harassing a former staff member. According to this complaint, the Greens leader banned women from entering a meeting room in his office which he described as 'the men's room' and described women working in his office as 'fat, hairy lesbians' and 'hairy-legged feminists'. The current leader of the Victorian Greens, Samantha Ratnam, is refusing to show some leadership and sack her disgraced candidate for Footscray, Angus McAlpine. Just this week, it has been reported that Mr McAlpine had boasted about drugging women and raping them, trivialised domestic violence and made a series of other disgusting sexist and homophobic slurs. This Greens candidate's behaviour has been criticised by the Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby and the Centres Against Sexual Assault, but Samantha Ratnam and the Victorian Greens continue to make excuses for him and to promote him under the Greens banner. Today the ABC reports that the Victorian Greens are also standing by their candidate for Sandringham, Dominic Phillips, who liked a series of sexist and racist social media pages which joked about pornography, degraded women and insulted multicultural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens cannot be trusted to stand up for Australia, Australian jobs, local industry and the role of women in society when they refuse to address the toxic culture of violent misogyny that currently plagues their party, including in my home state of Victoria. You can say that you have principles and values, but words are empty, as the Greens leader, Senator Di Natale, said yesterday. If you are not prepared to act in accordance with your principles, you have none; you become all that you complain of. That is what we see today in the Greens political party.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put this disallowance up because a most unusual situation has arisen in this chamber. Yesterday when I spoke about the GST reform I talked about Norman Lindsay's 1918 Australian classic, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Pudding</span>. To use another theatrical analogy for today's disallowance we have gone into <span style="font-style:italic;">The Twilight Zone</span>. Normally when this Senate considers whether or not to disallow a regulatory instrument, it matters to us and is important, because normally the regulatory instrument being considered and examined would make changes to the laws of the land. These changes would matter because these laws would affect the people we represent, but today is different. I really want senators to understand this. Today we have gone into the twilight zone of regulatory instruments. We are considering whether to disallow a regulatory instrument that has no effect in law. To be very clear: this is a regulation that doesn't regulate, this is a law that has no effect in Commonwealth law and this is a code of practice that has no practical effect from a legislative or legal point of view, and that is what makes it problematic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is perhaps ironic and indeed bewildering is that the Senate today with this disallowance is considering a voluntary code of practice for banking in Australia written by the Australian Banking Association. To give you a little bit of background, the banking industry and the banking sectorâthe Australian Banking Association is the body that represents the big and the small banksâhas had a voluntary code of conduct for many, many years. To provide a bit of context for senators, we have seenâand many of us in this chamber have sat throughânumerous inquiries over the last decade into misconduct in the financial services industry in Australia. Many of us have asked questions of the regulators at estimates and at numerous Senate inquiries into the regulation of the banks and the financial services industry. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eventually, after years of campaigning, we got a royal commission into the banks and the financial services industry. That royal commission is still sitting. While we've had an interim report, we haven't had a final report on the banks in this country. So the first important question we need to ask ourselves is: why is the Senate considering a voluntary code of conduct written by the banks for the banks? Commissioner Hayne has explained why this regulation doesn't matter. In his own words, he says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the code that the Senate, by default, is about to give its stamp of approval to, if you don't support the Greens' disallowance. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, because the financial sector is not regulated under the Competition and Consumer Act, this code is not enforceable. I say again: this is a voluntary code, and it was written by the banks for the banks. By the way, senators, this is the first time that a voluntary code has been before the Senate. I will explain why in a minute, and why this is actually a critical part of the debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Hayne has also explained how this code was created:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Although approved by ASIC, it is necessary to recognise that the content of the 2019 Code was also determined by those who are to be bound by its provisions: the banks themselves. It is they who decided how the definition of small business should be framed. It is the banks, therefore, who determined what reach the Code will have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll say it again: the banks have written this code for themselves. It is a code written by banks for banks. It is a voluntary code. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think anybody would disagree, including the banks who have put this new code forward, that their last voluntary code didn't work. It wasn't up to scratch. It wasn't up to standard. It failed the Australian people. It failed the customers of the banks and, ultimately, it failed the banks themselves. So, because the banks have written this code for themselves, by definition it's not particularly useful or helpful to anyone else. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this version of the code was announced there was much brouhaha about how good it would be for small business, but the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Ms Kate Carnell, has popped that bubble. Ms Carnell recently said that the code 'falls short of addressing the imbalance of power held by the banks' and that it 'will allow the continuation of the aggressive bank tactics revealed by the commission'. Similarly, Commissioner Hayne himself has raised concerns with the code and how it relates to a small business's ability to repay a loan. In fact, Commissioner Hayne has opened questions in his interim reportâand I hope all senators have read thatâdirectly regarding this issue. My office has spoken to Ms Carnell about this disallowance and about this voluntary code of conduct. By the banks' own admission, it's already out of date. But, perhaps most tellingly, the Australian Banking Association themselves are not happy with the version of the code that is before the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's synthesise this. The banks come up with a new voluntary code of conduct. Because of the royal commission and the shaming of the banks, they realise their voluntary code of conduct isn't working and they need a new oneâone that might actually work. What do they do? They go to ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and they say, 'Can you have a look at this voluntary code of conduct and tell us whether you think it's okay.' After a couple of months, ASIC come out and say, 'Yes, it's okay.' So ASIC have essentially given this their formal stamp of approval. That's why it's being considered before the Senate today, because ASIC have been dragged in by the banks, or maybe easily persuaded by the banks, to review their voluntary code of conduct and give it their stamp of approval. Because ASIC is involved, the Senate and the Australian parliament are involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me frame it for you again. If this disallowance doesn't get up today and, to use a Trump term, this fake regulation goes into effect, we are essentially giving our stamp of approval, as the Australian parliament, to this voluntary code of conduct. I don't think any senator would think now is the time to be doing that, before the royal commission has even delivered its final report. I'll come back later to what I think the motivations of the banks are for putting this voluntary code of conduct through this process before the royal commission has delivered its report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just emphasise what I said about Commissioner Hayne's own concerns about this voluntary code of conduct that we have before us. Why is this code of conduct that we're considering today out of date already? It's out of date already because as new revelations became public during the royal commission, including fees for no service and charging dead people, the banks decided they'd better write that into their code of conduct as well. Guess what: the banks have already changed their code of conduct. But it is not in the regulations that are before the Senate today. The regulations before the Senate today passed through a process prior to that, so it's already out of date. By the banks' own admission, the regulation we're looking at today is already out of date. By the banks' own admission, the code of conduct that has been endorsed by ASIC is deficient. The instrument in question refers to the code published in August 2018. Yet on Wednesday, 10 October 2018, last month, the ABA, the Australian Banking Association, announced further amendments to the code to stop banks from charging fees for no service and to ensure refunds to customers. You could be cynical enough to say it was also an important PR exercise to make a public statement that they were again updating their voluntary code of conduct. One does wonder, if the royal commission continued beyond its February date, what other revelations might come to light that might change a voluntary code of conduct which, by the wayâI'll say it againâwe are tacitly endorsing today if we don't disallow it. Apparently the August version of the code was not sufficiently robust to stop the banks from charging fees for no service, including to dead people. That, I say again, is the code that will go into fake regulation today if we allow it to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, the Senate is considering whether to approve ASIC's endorsement of an unenforceable code written by the banksâa voluntary codeâwhen the banks have admitted that the version of the code that has been endorsed by ASIC isn't good enough to stop them charging fees to dead people. That's what you will be allowing today if you don't support the Greens' disallowance of this voluntary code of conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This regulation is useless. It does nothing in light of the revelations of the royal commission. ASIC can't enforce the code of conduct, and it's not covered by the Competition and Consumer Act. Because it does nothing, that makes it dangerous, and I would argue that it also makes it a highly political document. This is a PR exercise for the banks. Why else would the banks be wanting to seek ASIC endorsement? From my understandingâand I stand to be correctedâthis is the first time ever that the banks have sought ASIC's endorsement for a voluntary code. I suspect they did it because of the royal commission and the revelations. They wanted to get ASIC's endorsement to give the code more weight. Then, of course, they wanted to get parliament's endorsement and allow it to pass into fake regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this place have better things to do than to sign off on window-dressing or potential brand-washing for the banks. I am happy to look at a code of conduct when the royal commission is finished and all these things have been thrashed out and the Australian public get their $60-plus million worth of deliberations by the Hayne royal commission. The royal commission has surprised just about everyone in this country, including many of its critics, and there were harsh critics, not just on the need for a royal commission but whether it would be a complete waste of money. Most of those critics have since swallowed their pride and publicly admitted that some of the revelations they've heard were shockingâmuch worse than they expected. I understand from speaking to Professor Stiglitz, who is in this building today, that the US is going through a very similar thing with some of the revelations they're hearing about their financial services sector. He said that the 10 years since the global financial crisis, the GFC, have revealed even more deep-seated problems, systemic failures and misconduct within the financial services industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, this is a one-off opportunity to get real reform in place within the financial services sector. I'm proud to be part of a party that has written to the royal commission. We made a substantial submission. I want to acknowledge the work of my office and Senator Di Natale's office in preparing that submission to the royal commission. Our submission outlined 18 structural reforms that we believe the commission should consider. By the way, we were invited by the royal commission at this point in time to make submissions on policy. Commissioner Hayne said that he wanted to hear from people on policy suggestions and policy solutions, and the Greens took that opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a one-off opportunity for reform. This is not the time to be giving the banks a chance to window-dress and to do the media. Next week, they're in front of the royal commission. Everyone is speculating that it is going to be a very difficult couple of weeks for the CEOs, the chief executives, going to the royal commission. They can say, with their hands on their hearts: 'We have just had our code of conduct through parliament. We have just had our code of conduct endorsed by ASIC, by the regulator. We've fixed our problems. Through this code of conduct, we've fixed the systemic problems that have led to the misconduct that you've seen in the royal commission.' Yet we know that it's not even covered by our laws and it's out of date already. Do not give them the opportunity to brand-wash, to window-dress, what has been one of the most serious issues that we have managed to achieve, as a House, as a Senate and as a parliament, certainly in this term of government, if not in many terms of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a one-off opportunity to get some real reforms in the financial services sector to protect customers, to reduce systemic risk and to hold capitalism to account. If you think I'm being a little bit startling in my comments, I will quote the current Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison, on the day that the royal commission was announced. Remember when Mr Turnbull, the then Prime Minister, said he would be calling for a royal commission? It was because we forced him to. This parliament forced him to. Mr Scott Morrison came out and said, 'This is not capitalism on trial, unlike what some people in this building would like to believe.' They were the exact words that Mr Scott Morrison used. Well, let me tell you: this has been capitalism on trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the very first week, the commissioner, after his initial deliberation, said to the banks, 'I wants you to go away and consider the proposition, how much profit is too much profit? At what point do you stop putting profit and a culture of profit before people?' In his interim statement, on the opening page, he said that 'greed' had caused the problems that he had seen through this royal commissionâgreed. Where do you draw the line? It's a very, very important question we have to answer. This is coming from a man that is not a leftie or a socialist trying to overthrow the capitalist system. This is a very well respected commissioner with all the resources the Australian people can give him and his commission at his disposal to get to the bottom of the problems that we've seen in this sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a critical moment in time for reformâin the next three months. It irks me that this fake regulation gives the banks a chance to say that they've actually achieved something through this royal commissionâto get a jump on Commissioner Hayne, to get a jump on this parliament and to get a jump on the Australian people and even potentially their customers. The royal commission and the Ombudsman have raised concernsâand I've gone through that todayâand the banks are currently redrafting it, even as it is before parliament and being considered. In the face of this widespread misconduct, the regulators and parliament should be focused on more meaningful reforms. It's the responsibility of the regulators and this parliament, not the banks, to write laws that govern this nation's banks in the public interest. It is better for there to be no regulation than for there to be unenforceable regulation. That's my proposition to you today. The days of the banks writing their own rules should be over, and we can send that message right here, right now, on behalf of the Australian people. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  Labor does not support this disallowance today, but we recognise that the code of practice has been manifestly inadequate. That is an important reasonâhowever inadequate the changes before the chamber might be todayâto recognise that there are improvements in the code of practice before us and that to disallow it simply reverts to the framework, right back from 2013, in which many of these problems are embedded. The current banking code of practice, as part of the regulation of banks and financial services, has not prevented massive misconduct from occurring. We've seen very clearly that the mix of self-regulation through the code of practice and regulation through the Corporations Act, ASIC, the National Consumer Credit Protection Act and other acts of this parliament have not adequately stopped banks and other financial service providers from becoming embroiled in these terrible scandals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been very clear to Labor for a long time that more needed to be done. It was clear to us that Australians needed better protections, that banks and financial service providers needed to lift their game. That is why Labor took the bold and courageous step in 2016 of calling for a banking royal commission. This decision wasn't easy. We were pilloried for it, derided by the government and we were told that a royal commission would be nothing more than a QC's complaints desk, a populist whinge and a reckless distraction. This government said that they thought that it would be a waste of time, and they did everything they could to stop it from happening. As we know, they voted against it in this parliament some 26 times. They set up parliamentary inquiries to try and head it off at the pass. They thought they could stop the scrutiny of the royal commission being applied to the banks. They have been wrong on all of these counts. The evidence within the Australian community of the impact of this misconduct is just too strong and the hurt that people have experienced is just too widespread.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Victims of financial services misconduct have come forward week after week. We've heard, through stories in the media and from members of parliament and the Australian community, about an industry that has been seen to have lost its ethical and moral compass. The government did indeed see the writing on the wall when it finally caved in to the pressure from Labor and the community and agreed to call this royal commission. That happened late last year, and now the Prime Minister, the member for Cook, has described the decision as regrettable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not surprising, given that this government has been hostile to the royal commission from the outset, that they have curtailed the time available for it to do its work. The commission has barely had the opportunity to scratch the surface of the misconduct that has occurred in the financial services industry. Certainly, I would personally like to add to the calls that hearings be held in my home state of Western Australia. Labor MPs from Western Australia have all signed up to lobby for that and to say that the community of Western Australia deserves to have its own story told. As we've heard, the context of misconduct varies from community to community, from state to state and from institution to institution, so it's really important that the voices of Western Australians are heard and that those Western Australians have the opportunity to tell their own stories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner has done an admirable jobâindeed, I think, a quite extraordinary job, given the circumstances. He was given a mere 14 months to inquire into retail banking, home lending and consumer lending, including consumer credit and personal loans, as well as small business lending, farm lending, general insurance, life insurance, superannuation and financial advice. This means they've had just two weeks to spend on each of these complex subjects, some of which have touched the lives of millions of Australians and some of which relate to services used by nearly every member of the Australian community. The commission has received over 10,000 submissions from the public. Ten thousand Australians took the time to let the commission know about their experiences of bank and financial service provider misconduct. But, because of the restrictive time line, only 27 victims out of 10,000 have had the chance to tell their story in person, and I can tell you that there are things to be learned from the specific characterisation of the experiences of victims themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The misconduct of the financial services sector is so widespread that it affects hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians, so we've called for the time available for the royal commission to be extended to allow more victims to have the opportunity to share their stories. The government, sadly, has been stubborn in its refusal to give the commission more time. This is why the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for financial services, along with some of my Labor colleagues around the country, have been holding their own roundtables with victims of banking misconduct, and we've heard from many, many victims whose voices haven't been heard through the royal commission process. These stories have been brutal and harrowing. People are hurting. Consequences of misconduct identified by the royal commission and, indeed, the consequences of other misconduct that Commissioner Hayne didn't have time to consider are being felt by families in every state and territory and in every city and town around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interim report were posed important questions about the future regulation of our financial services industry, and the commissioner's general observation has been of greed and the culture of the pursuit of profits above the honest and ethical conduct of the sector. This has been well reported and understood. These findings and this backdrop interim report will no doubt form the basis on which final recommendations will be framed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner has also made specific observations about self-regulation, and this is very relevant to today's debate, particularly in relation to the case studies heard by the commission. Commissioner Hayne discussed the competition between regulation and self-regulation and considered a specific example relating to the 2019 Banking Code of Practice, the document we are considering today. The example related to non-monetary defaults, where a lender is able to accelerate a loan or demand full repayment of a loan immediately, regardless of whether the borrower is behind in their rescheduled repayments. The code imposes some new limits on non-monetary default clauses, and the commissioner poses a question, presumably to be answered, I would hope, in his final report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Apart from existing rules prohibiting unconscionable conduct and rendering unfair contract terms void, should there be some additional rules that govern what a lender can or cannot do before it brings a loan to an end or it seeks to enforce repayment?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner goes on to discuss the provisions in the 2019 code, noting:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the 2019 Code will set limits on the use of provisions of that kind. Assuming that the contractual terms relied on are not unenforceable under the unfair contract terms provisions of the ASIC Act, and assuming further that reliance on the terms is not affected by the 2019 Code, are there any circumstances in which termination and renewal of a loan contract should be governed except by the general law of contract?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context we can see that this discussion demonstrates that the 2019 Banking Code of Practice, the document we are discussing today, is part of a very real regulatory framework that the commissioner will be considering when he makes his final report in February. That should not rule out us lifting those standards here today, not disallowing the lifting of those standards by reverting to the 2013 code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions of reform and improvement to regulations and laws are open to questions, regardless of the existence of the 2019 code. We acknowledge that this code is a step in the right direction, but we also acknowledge it comes nowhere close to fixing the problems identified by the royal commission so far. The commissioner has signalled that he will consider it as part of the existing regulatory environment, and he will consider whether more needs to be done to protect consumers and small business from misconduct and unfair practice and tactics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see this code as a small step in the right direction by industry. We know there's more to be done, and we look forward to the release of Commissioner Hayne's final report in February 2019. In the meantime, we should notâthis place should notâstand in the way of the banking industry coming forward and improving, however slightly, its code of practice. We aren't going to refuse to allow banks to improve the consumer protections they voluntary commit to delivering to Australians just because we are engaged in a parallel process of policy development through the royal commission. It is possible, thankfully, for us to allow the 2019 code to come into force and at the same time consider and implement regulatory change to further improve the banking and financial services sectors in coming months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have been completely consistent on this, and we will consider recommendations from Commissioner Hayne and the recommendations coming out from the many parliamentary inquiries into financial services that are running concurrently. However, the evidence before this place shows that there are real and practical lifts in sector standards in the new 2019 code of practice, and we should not stand in the way of it being delivered. In the meantime, what we in the Labor Party are focused on is doing what is necessary to restore trust and confidence in our banks and broader parts of the finance sector and to protect consumers from unethical and dishonest behaviour.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. Why is it the role of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to restore trust in the Australian banking sector? Why is it the regulator's role to restore trust by allowing an unenforceable code in Australian law to pass into fake regulation? How is that restoring trust? As I explained, Senator Canavan, this is not covered by the Competition and Consumer Act. I even read out the words of the royal commissioner himself. He said that, while there may be some contract law implications, it is not covered by the laws and legislation of this parliament. How is it restoring confidence to rubberstamp and give the seal of approval to the banks at this point in time, before the royal commission has even delivered its final report?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course the banks want to restore trust, and I genuinely hope that the Australian people's trust in the banks is restored. But let me say to senators: that's going to come from proper regulation and it's going to come from structural reform in the Australian banking sector and the financial services sector. I have outlined a number of reforms that the Greens believe need to happen, and the first thing I'd like to do is take the mandate for financial securities off ASIC and give it to the ACCC. We know the history. The ACCC had this mandate taken off them when a special regulator was set up for the financial services industry. I've read out in previous speeches that the people involved in that structural reform have now looked back and said: 'We made a mistake. It should have stayed with the ACCC.' I've got no problems with ASIC and their current resourcing or with the people at ASIC regulating the wholesale side of the market, but the retail side of financial services should be regulated by the ACCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of people who are supporting the Greens' call for the ACCC to regulate this industry. The ACCC have shown that they are prepared to take on companiesâthey have shown that. The problem with ASIC is that they have a conflicted mandate in this country. On the one hand, they have to factor into their decisions the stability, efficiency and functioning of the financial system; on the other hand, they have to protect consumers of financial services and financial products. That is why you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, have sat through countless inquiries listening to evidence about enforceable undertakings rather than strong action on white-collar crime. That's why we've had to endure that. I don't hold ASIC responsible for that; they've had a conflicted mandate from the start. Even when ASIC was set up, the point was raised that it was a specialist regulator set up for a specialist sector. Why does financial services have its own regulator? Who else does?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACCC covers everyone else. This was set up and people said: 'If you do that, you know what the risk is? The risk is that your regulator will become captured by the industry.' This is not me saying this; this is what has come out of the royal commissionâa weak regulator who has failed to do their job and who has been captured by the industry. Once again, I don't blame people at ASIC for this. They have a conflicted mandate, not to mention all of the resourcing issues they've had over the years. But it is time for structural reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan has come in here today to say that ASIC's essential rubberstamping of this fake regulation that isn't covered by Australian law is somehow going to restore the Australian people's trust in the banks. It isn't. It is the royal commission's job now to restore trust. Yes, it is ASIC's job to step up and take real action. But I am telling you that this is not real actionâa voluntary code of conduct unenforceable by Australian law. It's a code written by the banks for the banks that isn't even complete. I notice that Labor didn't even address this issue. The fake regulation that we have before us doesn't even address the updated voluntary code of conduct which has since been changed. I went through the detail a second ago. It has since been changed to make sure banks can't take fees for service from dead people. That is not even in this regulation. I would like to see Senator Canavan address that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just stress one more time that this is an important juncture in history for us to make substantive change, to be bold and to make sure that we can restore trust in the banking sector, not just for customers but also for the financial system, for the banks themselves and for their shareholders and other stakeholders in this debate. There is no way this voluntary code of conduct, which is not enforceable by law, written by the banks today, is going to restore the Australian people's faith in the banks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, senators care about the ocean and marine life and protecting our commercial and recreational fishing industries. Seismic testingâthe use of sonic guns to propel sound waves through the ocean to the depths of the ocean floorâand the potential impacts that is having on marine life and on the productivity of our fisheries is a very significant issue for a lot of communities around this country. I proposed a Senate references committee that would look at the impacts of seismic testing. In fact, I'll read this out to senators who are interested in this subject. I know they would all want to stand up for their coastal communities and the industries in those communities. I asked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the following matter be referred to the Environment and Communications References Committee for inquiry and report by 29 March 2019â</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put this motion to the Senate two days ago and, sadly, not only did it get defeated; Labor denied me leave to have the chance to talk about the motion they voted down, even though I know that fishing interests in Tasmania have contacted Senator Urquhart and others and urged them to support this inquiry, as I know stakeholders around the country have phoned their senators and urged them to support this inquiry. It was going to look at:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The impact of seismic testing on fisheries and the marine environment, with particular reference to:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some pretty big barneys going on between state governments and the federal government over new permits that have been released for the oil and gas industry. I know Senator Canavan will contribute to this debate, and I promise him that I won't cut him off like I did in the last one. My inexperience led me to jump to my feet and wrap up debate. I will be very interested to hear what he has to say, because I know, to use a quote, he has been 'under the pump'. Fishing interests have contacted his office, as no doubt they have many of his colleague's offices, and raised this issue with him. Keep in mind that a Senate inquiry is a chance for everyone to have their say. It is a chance to call witnesses and look at the evidence. There should be nothing to hide if you have nothing to hide. Nevertheless this inquiry has been shut down. Both Labor and the Liberal Party, I suspect, have been got to by big oil and gas and won't be supporting this inquiry. Let me go back to the terms of reference: we want to look at the regulation of seismic testing, and the interplay between state and federal governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been considerable concerns over this. I will shortly read from a summary where the New South Wales fisheries and environment minister was very angry that the federal government had thumbed its nose at his recommendations around new seismic permits off Sydney and Newcastle. Why not thrash that out in a Senate process where we can all participate, hear what different parties have to say and look at whether the balance is right? That is all that is. This is why I tried to initiate this inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rock lobster industry in Tasmania approached me and said, 'Senator, in this consultation process we basically have been given a week to provide our industry's feedback through NOPSEMA on new seismic surveys that are being allocated in Bass Strait and off the west coast of King Island.' King Island is one of my favourite places on Earth, it is absolutely amazing on so many different levels. The fishermen are worried about new seismic testing there. The commercial crayfishing industry are worried about new seismic testing. They had a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't take this from me; the rock lobster industry have been on the record and have spoken to the media. They want this inquiry. They have been asking senators and MPs to support this inquiry, because they are not happy with the consultation process. They believeâin their own wordsâthat it has been a 'box-ticking exercise'. I understand that Senator Urquhart apparently doesn't support this inquiry, because she doesn't believe that the seismic testing is going to occur until next year, but the consultation process has occurred now. That is part of this inquiry. That is why we are doing it. She clearly isn't standing up for the local fishing industry, who want this inquiry, which is very disappointing. The next terms of reference are:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This relates to the new, controversial permits that have been issued to big oil and gas. The terms of reference continue:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to tell a story about this. This is a true storyâof course, all of the stories I tell are true. When I started as a senator in 2012, a friend of mine that I went to school with contacted me over in Western Australia. He is a commercial snapper fishermen. He has a boat and he goes out and catches snapper, and that's how he makes his living. He contacted me and said, 'Peter, I've got big problems with seismic testing in my fisheryânot just problems of nearly getting mown down and run over by seismic boats but not having a say in when these seismic boats fire their massive sonic guns down into the ocean and the ocean floor.' He actually had a Mexican stand-off with a seismic boat that could have been really ugly. That's how desperate he's become, because he was being pushed out of his fishery. But he had mapped, through his own fisheries data, the massive decline in his fishing productivity when the seismic testing had occurred, in the years that the seismic testing had pushed him out of his fishery. He was told when and where he could fish by the oil and gas industry. That was his view. It was interesting at the time, because I said to him: 'You know what? In my home state of Tassie, the commercial fishing industry can open doors in state parliament and in federal parliament.' They get supported by a lot of senators in this place, and I've had my share of barneys with them over the years.</span>

                    </a>  I've had my share of barneys with them over the years, Senator Canavan, around supertrawlers and the impacts of salmon aquaculture on the pristine waters of Tasmania. I have had my barneys with the commercial fishing industries over the years. I know how good they are at getting what they want in this place. But do you know what I said to my mate? The pun wasn't intended. I'm not going to name him in here today, because I know he's actually had threats of violence against him because of the stance he's taken against seismic companies. I said: 'You know what? There is a bigger fish in the pond than you in Canberra and in your state parliament, and it is the oil and gas industry.' Senator Canavan knows that very well. They are the ones who will rule the roost here. I said, 'So, even though your commercial fishing interests may have support in parliaments, you are not going to get what you want if you cross the oil and gas industry.'</span>

This is the point I was getting to before Senator Canavan so rudely interjectedâsomething I would never do in this chamber! I said to my friend, 'I will look into this for you,' and in 2013 I spoke to Senator Colbeck about seismic testing in fisheries, and Senator Colbeck said to me, 'There's no evidence that seismic testing impacts the productivity of fisheries.' So I said, 'Okay.' I went and looked and, lo and behold, Senator Colbeck was right in one sense: there had been no studies. Considering how big this industry isâa multibillion- or trillion-dollar industry around the worldâthere had been virtually no studies.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got the reports here in front of me, and I haven't got time to go through them today. There was some data used from 1984-85 that was quoted in a report in 2002, which I'm happy to table, that looked at some impacts off US coastal areas. Recently there have been some reports and some studies done, including a study done in 2015, which I have here, on the impacts on the scallop industry, another industry that has been very concerned about the impacts of seismic testing. But very little has been done. It's completely underscrutinised, considering the size and importance of our commercial fishing industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to the new head of AIMS, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, at a Great Barrier Reef Foundation briefing recently. He said to me, 'I know you are trying to get an inquiry up on seismic, Senator Whish-Wilson. I want you to know that we have just received funding to do a proper study, an independent study, of the impact of seismic testing on fisheries.' I asked him how long it would take and he said about 18 months. So, some funding has been given to this industry. Through you Chair, I ask Senator Canavan: considering the uncertainty and the precautionary principle, why are we proceeding with giving out tens of thousands of kilometres of acreage to seismic companies without a proper study of its impact on marine life?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You all know that I care about cetaceans and ecosystems, and I do care about the livelihood of people like my mate in WA who is a commercial snapper fisherman, and I care for the rock lobster industry in Tasmania, and the scallop industry. Everything has to be in balance and this issue is one that we need to scrutinise. So, why has this Senate rejected a references inquiry? Once again, all I've got out of Labor is that they don't think it is a priority and they can deal with it next year, if they get into governmentâand I, of course, have no guarantee that they will. They don't believe that the seismic testing is occurring off the west coast of King Island until next year, even though the consultation process, which is the key issue the industry has, has just occurred and is not good enough. I know NOPSEMA has started to take a bit of extra action on consultation, since we have shone a light on it already. But this needs to be looked at thoroughly, including the regulation of this industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make no bones that I don't want to see more oil and gas exploration off the coast of Tasmania, in our pristine waters and in our fisheries, which, let me tell you, are under so much pressure. Our oceans right now, with warming waters, with ocean acidification and with plastics, are under pressure that is unprecedented in our historyâI am talking about anthropogenic history. Off the east coast of Tasmania, 90 per cent of our giant kelp forests are gone. That evidence was presented to my Senate inquiry in Hobart by a diver, Mick Baron from Eaglehawk Dive Centre. In the December before the March inquiry, he said, ''Whishy', I want you to come out and bring your cameras and I want you to dive on these kelp forests before they are gone.' Then, when he presented at my inquiry in March, he said, 'You're too late. The last ones have gone.' They were an ecosystem that stretched from north-east Tasmania, from Mount William, all the way down to the south-west wilderness area. They were 10,000 years old and as important to the ecosystem of Tasmania as the Barrier Reef is to Queensland. They are gone. I'll tell you, Senator Canavan, there will be information out shortly, which IMAS currently has, and we have been waiting for for some time, about the impact of urchin barrens, Tasmania's version of the crown of thorns starfish, which is killing the reef. I know that nearly a third of Tasmania's reefs are dead from urchin barrens, the infestations that have occurred through warming waters and pressures on our reefs from overfishing. The only thing that kills the urchin barrens is lobsters. There is a lot of pressure on our fisheries. This year, our abalone industry, for the first time, voluntarily didn't catch their quota. In fact, they didn't even catch a single abalone off the east coast of Tasmania. They are under that much pressure. We have seen Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome cripple our oyster industry in Tasmania, because of warming waters and new diseases and new viruses. We have seen algal blooms shut down our recreational fisheries, including scallops, and we have seen declining catches in just about every fish species in state waters, including the sentinel species that used to be held up as the robust example of how our fisheries management is workingâthat is, flathead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think anyone I speak to on the east coast of my state would disagree that the oceans are in trouble. So why are we adding extra pressure to our oceans unnecessarily by firing massive sonic guns for the oil and gas industry down into our waters when preliminary studies done by IMAS on the scallop industry show they have an impact? They do have a productivity impact on the larvae of scallops. That's only a preliminary study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very, very serious matter and it's not just an issue in my state. Senator Hanson-Young is going to talk about South Australia, and I know there will be a lot of New South Wales senators or MPs, if they could, who would like to talk about their serious concerns that off North Sydney and Newcastle is the biggest area that has been opened up to seismic oil and gas exploration and potentially oil rigsâyou name it. It's coming at a time when our ocean is broken. We have to take a stand. All I am asking the Senate to do today is support a Greens inquiry to provide some transparency on this. Everybody gets their sayâthe oil and gas industry, the seismic industry, NOPSEMA, the commercial fishing industryâand we do the job that we were elected by the Australian people to do: to look at this. There's no reason not to support this inquiry. I implore all senators to rethink the position they took two days ago of voting down this inquiry.</span>

It won't be supporting this motion, because, as was clearly outlined in Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution, this is not an inquiry that is being established to get to the bottom of the best science on these very important matters. It is not an inquiry to do a consultation in good faith. It is an inquiry that is intending to try and shut down a very important Australian industry. That's the objective of the Australian Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Australian Greens to come into this place and try to present themselves as somehow a defender and supporter of the proud Australian fishing industry is taking the hypocrisy of the Greens to a whole new level. We've seen their hypocrisy time and time again in this place, but today they have taken it to a new level. This is the party that has tried time and time again to shut down Australian fishing. They try and shut down Australian fishing. They've moved motions this year to try to lock out more Australian family fishermen from their grounds to try and provide for their families. That is their agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the government support all Australian industries. We want to see Australian businesses flourish. We want to see Australian families be able to provide for themselves in our fishing industry, in our resources industry, in our agricultural industries and in our small businesses right across the length and breadth of this country. We have a very proud history of oil and gas production, including in the areas that Senator Whish-Wilson outlined. I note, and I'll make some comments on, the proposals for seismic testing off the Victorian coast that Senator Whish-Wilson referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Senator Whish-Wilson failed to refer to in his lengthy contribution on this debateâthis goes to his agenda to shut down the industry; he's not approached this particular issue in good faith and he has decided to ignore clear facts that are inconvenient to his particular arguments. What Senator Whish-Wilson has completely glossed over is that just north of the state where he lives, near the seismic testing Senator Whish-Wilson has referred to, is the Bass Strait, where we have produced oil and gas in this country for more than 50 years, including through the use of seismic testing to explore areas. That has supplied Australia with hydrocarbons for half a century. It was of great assistance to this nation, particularly in response to the OPEC oil crisis. We were very, very fortunate that that particular field started to be developed just before the OPEC oil crisis in the 1970s. That was more luck than planning, but we were very lucky that it came online in the 1970s.  It meant that during that period we were not affected as severely as countries like the United States were, because we were self-sufficient or almost self-sufficient in oil and gas thanks to the Bass Strait. And of course we benefited from the higher oil prices as a large oil and gas producer. So our economy was insulated in the 1970s thanks to the production in the Bass Strait. Since then, we've continued to produce a significant amount of, largely, gas these daysânot oilâfrom the Bass Strait, and we've done so in an incredibly safe way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Senator Whish-Wilson had real evidence, he would be able to point to areas where our regulations and our oversight of the industry in the Bass Strait have been inadequate, and that evidence is simply not there. It is not there, because we have in this country a very robust regulatory process that we take extremely seriously, and it has served our nation well. We've been able to protect our environment as well as provide the essential inputs for a modern economy, which include oil and gas.</span>

Unfortunately, because we are not producing as much, particularly oil, from the Bass Strait anymore, our reliance on overseas imports to serve those needs have increased rapidly, particularly in the last 20 years. At the start of this century, on the eve of September 11, we as a nation produced enough petroleum products to supply 95 per cent of our nation's needsâ95 per cent of our nation's needs in 2000-01. Sixteen years later, in 2016-17âthe latest figures we haveâwe only produced enough petroleum to serve 48 per cent of our nation's domestic needs. Most of that comes from northern Western Australia. It is exported, too, because of its proximity to those markets. But the fact is, in the space of less than 20 years, we have gone from being effectively or almost self-sufficient in petroleum products to being able to supply only half of our domestic needs. That is a serious issue. It is a serious issue for consumers in Australia. But it is probably more of a serious issue for the security of our nation, given our vulnerability now due to the need to import such important products as oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should continue to search for new areas like the Bass Strait, which has served us so well for 50 years. We should bring the best science to bear to do that. And, of course, in doing that, we should make sure we consider, listen to and protect other Australian industries that might be affected by that search. That is why we are actively engaged in this. Senator Whish-Wilson touched on this and glossed over it a bit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we have a very robust independent regulatory process. All applications to conduct seismic testing or petroleum production in Australia require approval from NOPSEMA, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. It is an independent agency. It is incredibly robust. I think it is staffed with extremely well qualified and diligent public servants, and they independently assess all of these plans. Again, Senator Whish-Wilson just glosses over the facts that aren't convenient to his cause. He didn't mention that one of the large seismic proposals he was speaking about, a proposal by CGG for off the coast of Victoria, was recently sent back by NOPSEMA. NOPSEMA thought that CGG's plans, their proposals, were not up to scratch and NOPSEMA sent them back to CGGâwhich they do all the time. They are very diligent regulators. And, by the statute NOPSEMA operate under, they must not accept environmental plans that pose a risk to the environment which is not as low as practicable, and they take that very, very seriously. This of course includes assessing the risks to other industries, including our very important fishing industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we as a government are very actively engaged with international researchers and the science on these matters. We have funded a number of research projects in recent years on the impact of seismic surveys, including their impact on zooplankton, marine invertebrates, rock lobsters and others. These have been funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the industry and government. In 2016, Geoscience Australia, another fantastic independent government agency, published in its marine pollution bulletin a comprehensive review and evaluation of existing research on seismic impacts on fish and invertebrates. In 2017 the CSIRO, an extremely respected research institution in our country, completed an independent zooplankton modelling study. All of those are available publicly. As Senator Whish-Wilson outlined, funding has been provided to the Australian Institute of Marine Science to undertake further research into the impacts of sound from seismic air guns and vessels on benthic fish and pearl oysters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This research, as I said, is publicly available. I regularly catch up with those doing this research and with NOPSEMA, as I mentioned, to make sure that they are properly assessing this. All of this science factors into their decision-making.</span>

                    </a>  I am perturbed sometimes that the Australian Greens seem to often disparage the diligence and professionalism of the Australian Public Service. When they get a decision from the Australian Public Service that they don't like, they come out and cast all sorts of aspersions about motivations and say that it must be because of the oil and gas industry. I think it's an absolute disgrace. Our Australian public servants do a fantastic job and take their role extremely seriously. I don't believe they're influenced by such motivations as those often ascribed to them by the Greens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also continuing extensive consultation with the industry over these issues. My understanding is that Minister Colbeck will be convening a meeting and a roundtable with the oil and gas sector and the seafood industry later this week on these matters. In fact, I have recently caught up with the oil and gas industry to stress how important these matters are. I know they are taking them very, very seriously. In November last year I announced a series of reports to improve the consultation practices and transparency of the offshore oil and gas sector. New measures will include the full publication of draft environmental plans and a mandatory public comment period on plans relating to exploration activities. The department has released draft amendments to the environment regulations to implement these measures, along with an explanatory document to provide further information on the proposed changes. All of that is available on the industry department's website, and we are consulting with the seafood industry as well to make sure those new consultation requirements will meet their needs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that even before we will formally require these greater consultation practices, Equinor, the Norwegian state oil company that has acreage or leases in the Great Australian Bight, has committed to publishing their environmental plans. They have already been conducting consultation, although they have not submitted an environmental plan for the Great Australian Bight. But the Great Australian Bight is an incredibly prospective oil and gas district. It is often characterised as perhaps the most prospective offshore oil and gas area in the world. Wouldn't it be fantastic if we can develop and open up a new oil and gas basin that can secure oil security and national security for this nation, and, of course, provide enormous economic wealth and prosperity to South Australia and other parts of the country? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this certainly seems to be the view of locals on the ground in South Australia, with a number of mayors being elected over the weekend in regional South Australia who are supportive of development of the Great Australian Bight. The Greens and green activist groups have been running a scare campaign over these issues throughout these areas, and that has clearly fallen flatâfallen absolutely flat. Michael Pengilly has been elected as the mayor of Kangaroo Island. He was asked about the Great Australian Bight this week and said: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I donât oppose it, my view is very strongly that the environmental lobby have successfully run a great fear campaign against it. Everybody is environmentally conscious these days but you need to have some clarity and common sense. Our economy revolves around the oil industry, we have to have energy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Mr Pengilly, the new mayor of Kangaroo Island, is speaking common sense thereâsomething that there's a distinct lack of from the Australian Greens. Common sense is something you generally do not hear much from the Australian Greens. I'd also mention the new Port Lincoln mayor, Brad Flaherty, who's also agreed that it's not an issue for local government. Mr Flaherty says that he's pro-employment and pro-businessâ</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. As I was saying, I think the people of South Australia have spoken over the weekend. They support economic development. They support sensible and commonsense approaches to this issue. We must have environmental rigour and robust regulations around this, which we do have in this country. We must strive to continue to improve those regulations, as I did last year, requiring more information and transparency from the oil and gas sector. We do of course have a serious national security issue, where we have only 21 days of petrol available at the moment in Australia. We have only 19 days of diesel available at the moment. That is a serious concern that the government is taking action to rectify. One of the more important, or certainly more effective, ways we could better handle that issue and secure safety for the Australian people in our country is to increase our own domestic production of oil and gas if that proves possible to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support appropriate regulation of this industry. As I've said, it has a proud history: 190 seismic surveys have occurred in the Gippsland and Otway basins since the 1960s. We've robustly regulated those in the past; we will continue to do that in the future. We support continued efforts to increase that robustness and increase consultation but not stunts from the Australian Greens, which are simply about trying to shut down Australian jobs, Australian industry and Australian national security, not improve the environment. We are focused on the commonsense actions we can take to continue to do that. We will continue to defend proud Australian industries like the Australian seafood industry, the Australian fishing industry and the Australian oil and gas industry. All of those industries provide jobs and enormous wealth to our country. We are proud of them and we'll continue to work with them for the best results for the Australian people.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  Todayas we did on Monday when the Greens brought on an almost identical reference for debate, Labor will oppose this motion. That is not because of notice or any other reason other than that we don't support this motion for referral on its merits. We have our own proud record of protecting the environment and our precious oceans. We're very proud of our record in terms of the network of marine parks that we've put in place, and we're fighting very hard to restore these protections, which were stripped away by this government. We stopped the supertrawler and as a future government we will make this ban permanent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have before us is the Greens being all at sea in managing the committee they propose to send this issue to. We in the Labor Party are very aware of the community and industry concerns in relation to NOPSEMA's processes and community concerns and consultation around seismic testing. Labor Party MPs and senators have had ongoing discussion with community and industry stakeholders in relation to their concerns about these impacts. But, as those in the Greens would know, NOPSEMA is at this very moment consulting on draft regulations. These regulations aim to improve consultation and the transparency of offshore oil and gas with respect to seismic testing. It would frankly be silly to duplicate this process here in the Senate, particularly in an environment where we won't see the experts work together directly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note the consultation page of NOPSEMA currently includes proposed changes which would require the publication of environmental plans by the titleholder on acceptance by NOPSEMA and also formalise a public comment period on environment plans for exploration activities, including seismic surveys. It's good to see this improved engagement from NOPSEMA with the seafood industry. They published an information paper in September this year for proponents of seismic testing for acoustic emissions to assist with the kinds of deficiencies that have been coming up in environmental plans when it comes to seismic testing. This information paper said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A range of deficiencies have been commonly identified by NOPSEMA in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for acoustic emissions from seismic surveys. These deficiencies have contributed to protracted assessment timeframes, reduced operational flexibility and challenges to industryâs social license to operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see now is NOPSEMA inviting stakeholders to provide feedback on these regulations to the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science by no later than 16 November. Public consultations have already been held in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne. We know there will be further consultation with the oil and gas industry and the seafood industry. What's really important is that these conversations are allowed to continue without the blatant politicisation that we see before us on these issues from the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also note that, while these regulations are being looked at and the processes are being changed, there is indeed no seismic testing approved for this summer in the regions that the Greens have listed in their reference for this committee. We understand that NOPSEMA has been actively engaging with both the seafood industry and the oil and gas industry with respect to proposals for seismic testing this summer. Regions listed in the motion are: the Otway Basin; Newcastle, New South Wales; and Kangaroo Island. So why would we see a Senate inquiry from the parliament of Australia examine seismic testing in only one of NOPSEMA's regulatory regions and two very discrete subregions? I'm surprised to see that, despite Senator Whish-Wilson being a senator for Tasmania, he didn't include in his motion the Gippsland Basin off south-east Victoria and, indeed, north-east Tasmania. We know that there are issues of concern that have come from the local seafood industry in those places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want to also highlight to the chamber today is that this proposal doesn't have merit in its duplication of processes and engagements that are already going on and that this reference seeks to be sent to the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee among its many inquiries and, frankly, its many Greens chairs. By 'Greens' I mean plural Greens. They have not been able to delegate responsibility for the committee to a single senator. </span>

                    </a>  We have seven inquiries before the references committee, including the ABC governance reference. The Labor Party sought to send that reference to the finance and public administration committee. We can see that it has hearings scheduled for later this month. I have to say that this committee has little or no time this year for other hearings. If this were an urgent inquiry rather than a political stunt coming from the Greens, the Greens would have supported our reference of the ABC governance issue to go to a different committee. It is not appropriate use of the Senate's time, frankly, to create inquiries to attempt to score political points when the particular committee in question is bursting at the seams with inquiries already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is premature to initiate a Senate inquiry into community consultation on seismic testing, because there is significant consultation already underway, and it is through that process that people should have their voices heard. We in this place, on the Labor side, want to listen to all sides engaged in this issue: the industry doing the seismic testing, the fishing industry and broader community concerns. But we will not stand here to prejudge government- and industry-led consultation that seeks to resolve these serious issues that have both environmental and commercial significance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will stand up for our environment, and we have a proven track record of doing soâa proven track record of delivering reform and not stripping away protections or grandstanding to score political points while letting opportunities slip by. So today I would like to encourage the Greens to acknowledge that this motion has twice been unsuccessful in just three days. We need to let the oil and gas industry and the seafood industry, together with government regulations, get on with the job of resolving these issues first through their current rounds of consultation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  Centre Alliance will be supporting this reference today. It will be doing so not just because it relates to an activity that takes place in a Commonwealth jurisdiction and not just because the terms of reference are quite reasonable. I might go out on a limb here and say that, of all the senators in this chamber, I probably understand more about seismic testing than anyone else, having taught acoustics for the better part of a decade and having built seismic sonarsâparametric sonars. So I do know a little bit about the topic. I've taught people in the survey industry and people in Navy how to make sure, when they are operating very powerful sonars, that they minimise the risk to marine mammals and other life forms in the ocean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I can say also is that the science on this is not settled. I appreciate what Senator Canavan said about a number of studies that are underway, and indeed they could be used as input to this particular inquiry. I also might point out that the technology is not settled in relation to these sorts of activities. There are all sorts of different technologies that come into play. There are very simple seismic guns. There are sonars that use directivity to make sure the sound is directed at the sea floor and not necessarily more broadly across the ocean. There are parametric sonars that are designed to give better penetration of the sea floor without necessarily causing harm to marine life that is in the vicinity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that often doesn't take place with government funded inquiries is the gathering of perspectives from all sorts of different stakeholders. I know better than others that there are circumstances where seismic testing or loud sonic noises underwater cause harm. I know that, if you're a diver and you are near a loud acoustic source, it can be painful and it will cause disorientation. The Navy use it as a technique to prevent enemy divers getting near a ship. So there's no question that there are circumstances where this sort of activity can cause harm, but there are also circumstances where it doesn't cause harm, and an inquiry like this would be useful in understanding the bounds, where the danger lies, where the harm lies and, indeed, what different technologies might change the parameters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan has raised perhaps a somewhat extremist view on the other side of the question from where he accuses the Greens of doing so, perhaps on the left side of the spectrum. The reality is I'm not necessarily suggesting that you stop this activity and prevent oil and gas activities going ahead, although I don't support them in the Great Australian Bight for other reasons. The point is that there are things you can do with technology that may make it better, may make it safer. We should explore those things and use that knowledge to potentially adjust regulations. So this is not necessarily about stopping seismic testing altogether; it's about making sure that, when it occurs, the least harm is caused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to correct Senator Canavan, who suggested that the Mayor of Kangaroo Island Council has made a statement and therefore the people of South Australia have spoken. I just checked. He had 1,480 votes. I don't think that is the people of South Australia talking on it. I want to put that on the record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is: if we don't support this inquiry then we simply won't get to understand how we could perhaps do this better.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I rise to contribute to this debate on what is an important motion to establish an inquiry into seismic testing. I'd firstly like to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague Senate Whish-Wilson, who has outlined all of the very, very good reasons why a Senate inquiry into seismic testing is needed and why even the suggestion that the Senate inquire into this issue has already helped push along some response from industry and from the government agency and departments involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why am I particularly influenced by and passionate about this issue today? Because as a senator for South Australia I now know, as of last Friday, that the government agency NOPSEMA will, in the first half of next monthâso in three weeks timeâhand down a decision as to whether the Norwegian company PGS can undertake seismic testing in the Great Australian Bight in March next year. That's why this inquiry is urgent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from Senator Pratt, representing the Labor opposition, a lot of weasel words as to why Labor were not prepared to support this inquiry. They said it was because none of it was urgent; it could be done next year; none of this was important. I can tell you that it may not seem urgent to a senator from Western Australia but it is important to those of us in South Australia who are absolutely horrified that the Norwegian company PGS want to, during March, send blasts through the waters not far from Kangaroo Island, not far from Port Lincoln. We know that the last time this occurred in the Great Australian Bight dead whales washed up on the coast at Ardrossan, right onto the beach. There were seven sperm whales found dead on the beach in South Australia last time seismic testing occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, of course, that the fishing industry in South Australia is also very concerned about this testing happening. They're concerned firstly because of the impacts it had last timeâdead whales, a decline in scallops, a decline in rock lobster and a decline in types of planktonâbut they're also very, very concerned, as is the majority of the South Australian voting public, that seismic testing will be the first step towards drilling in the Great Australian Bight. The application currently before the government agency for approval is to do this type of loud, dangerous testing and blasting in the water, affecting the dolphins, whales and other marine life, is only 90 kilometres from Kangaroo Island and 80 kilometres from Port Lincoln, right in the heart of South Australia's tourism jewel. We're worried. We're absolutely worried that if this testing is to go ahead, it is the first step to drilling these areas as well. We've already got an application for drilling in the Great Australian Bight from the Norwegian company Equinor, and these tests are to set the path for new applications for drilling as well. We don't want it in the Great Australian Bight and we don't want it just off the coast of Kangaroo Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people might suggest, as we heard the minister do in this place, that the Greens are just scaremongering. I tell you what: most South Australians are scared and terrified of what will happen if we allow drilling in our precious bight. We've got every right to be scared; we've got every right to be terrified, because there was a report from the company, Equinor, with their own modelling, leaked today into the public. Of course, they never wanted it to be seen by the voters in South Australia or by the communities. This report shows that if there were a spill in the Great Australian Bight our entire coastline would be devastated, and not just in South Australia. This report from Equinor themselves shows that oil would drift beyond the South Australian coastline all the way up to Bondi Beach in Sydney and all the way up to Port Macquarie. Every Australian who loves our coastline, who believes in our beautiful beaches, who spends time fishing and swimming, whose industries, jobs and businesses rely on a healthy coast should be terrified that this government, backed up by the opposition, is willing to tick off on an operation that is going to put this at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just some kind of Greens scaremongering. This is the company's own internal document that has been leaked. Of course they didn't want it getting out to the public. They don't want people to know how dangerous drilling for oil would be in the Great Australian Bight if there were a spill. They say: 'We don't want there to be a spill. It's just that, if there were one, this is what would happen.' It's not a risk worth taking. What this document shows is that, even in the oil company's own full-scale oil spill maps, there is no way they would be able to contain the oil and the sludge and the muck and prevent it ruining our coastline, ruining our beaches and devastating our fishing and tourism industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I love South Australia's beautiful beaches, but I also grew up on the coast in Victoria. When I was a kid, I used to go swimming down at Cape Conran. That whole area will be devastated. Further up the coastâthe South Coast of New South Wales, Bondi Beach in Sydney, Port Macquarie, South West Rocksâwill be devastated, covered in oil and sludge and muck. It wouldn't just cost billions and billions of dollars and thousands of hours of people power to clean up. Some places would never recover. In South Australia, where our coastline is so pristine, there is no way it would ever recover. There is a reason these big multinational foreign companies don't want to have to pay for the insurance of our tourism and fishing industries if they undertake this drilling: they know that the payouts would be so huge that it just makes the whole project unviable. South Australians are absolutely terrified that our coastline, our tourism industry and our precious Kangaroo Island are, right now, being hung out to dry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry is the first step in trying to put a spotlight on what is going on. If the seismic testing happens, there will be even more companies drilling for oil and gas, not just Equinor. We already know how devastating one oil spill would be. Imagine if there were more wells popped around the Great Australian Bight, where there are very, very deep seabeds and incredibly deep and rough seas. All of the experts say how difficult it would be to ensure that this could be done safely and without accident. All we need to do is look at what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, where it was much shallower and there were much calmer waters and much more experience; yet BP's oil spill still hasn't been cleaned up from over a decade ago. The fishing and tourism industries in that area have been absolutely decimated. That is what will happen in South Australia if we do not put a stop to this once and for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extremely disappointing to see the Labor Party and the Liberal Party today voting down a mere inquiry into seismic testing. What are you afraid of? What are you afraid this inquiry might uncover? What are you afraid the Australian people will find out? I heard Senator Canavan, the minister, talking about this issue and saying that people in South Australia don't care about this. Well, he is dead wrong. Labor and Liberal senators in this place from South Australia know that he's dead wrong. There is a reason they are not in here today defending the gutless positions of their parties. Not one representative from the South Australian Liberal Party or the South Australian Labor Party have come in here today to defend this gutless position of their parties. That is because they know that they will be turfed out if the South Australian community gets wind of just how dismissive their parties are being to this issue in South Australia and to our coastline, our beaches and our industries. But it is not just their parties being gutless on this issue; they should be in here standing up for their stateâand they are not. They are not standing up for their beautiful beaches. They are not in here defending our environment, and they are not in here defending our tourism and our fishing industries. Instead, we have members of their party accusing those of us who are trying to stop this horrendous activity from happening of being scaremongers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The company's own private internal documents show that it would be a wipe-out if there was an accident, even if we just allowed that seismic testing to occur, as the first step to more oil or gas wells being drilled closer to Kangaroo Island and closer to Port Lincoln. The last time that happened, dead whales washed up on the beaches in South Australia. That is what happened in December 2014. I don't want to see that happen this summer. I don't want to see anymore dead whales washed up on South Australian beaches this summer because this government and the Labor Party are too gutless to stand up to big oil and big gas in this country. Stop the weasel words, get out of the pockets of the oil and gas industry, and do something for the voters and the community in South Australia. That's what I am here doing. That's what the Greens are doing. We will stare down the interests of these big oil and gas companies, and we will stand up for our marine life and our environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  I'll wrap up debate now, in the remaining minutes. I would just like to say we have a really good example tonight of why you need the Greens in this parliament, in the Senate, to hold both Labor and Liberal, the duopoly of Australian politics, to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been outlined by Senator Pratt and Senator Canavan that there are things going on in the seismic space in this country. There are roundtable meetings going on between the fishing industry and the oil and gas companies. NOPSEMA went through a whole new process in September. They've reopened consultation on seismic applications and the concerns of stakeholders. Guess what: I went to the media in July this year and said, 'I am going to move for a Senate inquiry into seismic testing in this country.' The Greens said they were going to move for a Senate inquiry and, lo and behold, we had a little bit of sunlight and a little bit of scrutiny and things started happening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while we may lose this debate todayâand, sadly, that looks like it's going to be the caseâI and my colleagues here can say today that this is why you need the Greens in the Senate. This is why NOPSEMA has gone through a new process that they announced in September, because we stood up for stakeholders. We stood up for the rock lobster industry. We stood up for the tuna industry in South Australia. We stood up for regional communities, and things started happening. We have seen there's going to be a whole new round of consultations and roundtable meetings now between industry and other stakeholders. Senator Colbeck is going to get the oil and gas industries together with the fishing industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have liked to do this in the public eye through a Senate references inquiry. I said I and the Greens were going to do this in July. We have given plenty of time for Labor to come on board. Unfortunately, they have proven tonight what I, sadly, in my heart, probably knew anyway: that they're in bed with the oil and gas industry. Let me tell you what: this augurs very poorly for when they most likely get into government at the next election, when they have said they are going to bring in a new marine protected areas campaign and strategy. We know that oil and gas got to them last time, and they watered down their marine protected areas program in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just more evidence that their donors and the lobbyists who have come from the Labor Party have got to themâthe fact they won't even support a public inquiry into seismic testing, even with the fishing industry calling their offices and meeting with them. I know the fishing industry have been to Canberra and have gone to the offices of senators and ministers and asked for this inquiry, but they won't support it. Why did I get denied leave yesterday even to make a statement about this in the Senate when this inquiry went down? I'll leave that to the Australian people and those stakeholders who are listening to this debate to work out for themselves, but that's how it often works in here: those people who call the shots are actually the vested interests. There is nothing wrong with scrutiny of this industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me finish by saying that seismic testing poses an unacceptable risk to the health of our oceans. There has been almost no research done on this. Senator Patrick, who understands seismic testing, is prepared to admit that. Marine wildlife, including migrating whales, and productive fisheries resources are all at risk, and we had a chance today to actually scrutinise the effect of this massive trillion-dollar industry and the potential impacts seismic testing is having on our oceans at a time in history when our oceans desperately need us to look after them.</span>

The Greens have done a very good job chairing the Environment and Communications References Committee. There is scope for this inquiry. The claim by Labor that there is no time and no resources for that committee to look at this is a load of rubbish.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  I'm a strong supporter of the trade union movement, and tonight I rise to lend my support to the national No-one Deserves a Serve campaign being run by my union, the SDA. No-one Deserves a Serve is designed to educate consumers and reinforce the right of workers to do their job without fear of abuse or violence in the workplace. This is something that most of us take for granted in our jobs, but, unfortunately, for many workers, particularly those in the retail and fast food sector, regular abuse is a reality. With only six weeks until Christmas, many of us will soon be heading out to do Christmas or holiday shopping. It's probably going be hot. It could take ages to find a car park. The kids might be clamouring for this new toy or that new video game. Some people might just have had a bad day. Whatever the circumstances, I implore shoppers to keep calm and always be respectful to the staff who are serving you, whether it's in the supermarket, the department store, the food court or the drive-through, because no-one deserves a serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the SDA, particularly the national secretary, Gerard Dwyer, and the national assistant secretary, Julia Fox, for organising a briefing for politicians in Canberra during the last sitting week. I particularly want to thank the courageous workers from the ACT area who told us their stories. I will highlight a couple of the stories that workers have told people through this campaign on the SDA's website. Some of the comments that workers are making are very disturbing. People are saying: 'We get yelled at and abused all the time.' Another quote was: 'Screaming, yelling, swearing, hands being thrown around, invading personal space and provocative behaviour when in an even more vulnerable position such as door-greeter. I've been a victim of serious abuse and threatening behaviour when things were thrown at me and security management had to become involved.' Somebody else said: 'I've had customers throw products at me for simple things like product is out of stock.' Somebody else made the comment: 'Once a team member was held up with a syringe.' Another comment was: 'The customers swear at you when they don't get their way.' Somebody else said: 'I have been spat at. I've had a hot roast chicken and a bag of salad thrown at me.' Finally: 'I've been spat on during a theft incident. I've had people threaten to harm me and my staff after we refused service due to intoxication.' These stories are horrifying. No-one deserves to go to work worrying about whether they will be yelled at or have things thrown at them during their shift. It is simply un-Australian. Let's not forget that these are the same workers who will be working for less money during the public holidays this Christmas. I commend the SDA for this important campaign. This is the type of campaign that demonstrates the vital role that unions play in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will acknowledge another issue that is a major win for the SDA. In September the SDA won a very long running case in the Fair Work Commission that will see penalty rates increase for 350,000 casual retail workers working on Saturdays and evening work. The impact of that decision takes place from the beginning of this month. So casuals working in the retail industry and dependent on the general retail industry award to determine their conditions of employment will start to see some increases in their pay packets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This case was lodged back in 2015. We know how much effort and work goes into these applications and the arguments that have to occur against opposition from employer groups, and that happened on this occasion. I want to make the point that the work the union did in securing this significant win for 350,000 retail workers not only benefits union members who pay their union fees to the SDA union but also benefits many people who are not members of the union and who work in the retail industry. This illustrates the important role of unions and the benefit they provide to our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pay increases for casuals will be phased in over the next three years, to 2020. It's a great win for the SDA. Once again, it shows the importance of people joining their union to fight for wage increases and for working conditions for Australian workers. We know that Australians need a pay rise, not a pay cut, and unions are there to help people get a pay rise.</span>

It's at 16.2 per cent now, when you look at average full-time wage base salary. When we include things like overtime and other bonuses and perks, it comes up to $25,717 more, or 21 per cent more, that men are earning each year on averageâ$26,000 more for a man in an average full-time job, with the perks, just because he's a dude. There's no other explanation for this gender wage gap, except sheer sexism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that the overall gender pay gap has actually dropped by one per cent. That's very welcome. It's a step in the right direction. But I have two points on that. At that pace, it will take 50 years for us to eliminate the gender pay gapâ50 years is too long to wait for equality. We saw also that the gender pay gap went up in several industries. What I thought was most alarming was that of the companies that are reporting data only 40 per cent are doing anything about it once they realise that they have a problem and a gender pay gap in their workplace. The WGEA described it as an 'action gap'. What employer could discover that they have a gender pay gap and then wilfully decide to do nothing about it? That's an absolute abomination and an indictment on the fact our laws are so weak that they don't require the gap to be fixed once it's been identified. We'd love to strengthen that, because we think there's no other reason for this gap than sexism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to the one per cent drop in the pay gap, the reason it's shrunk is not because the government has the policies and can claim any credit, as the minister tried to do today. It is because the mining boom has come off the boil. Men are now earning less, because some of those extremely high salaries they were enjoying under the mining boom have evaporated. It's not that we're actually narrowing the gap because women are getting paid more; it's just because men are getting paid less. So I'm afraid I don't buy the government's argument that this is in any way creditable to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a gender pay gap that's sexist and we have an action gap on doing anything about it. Sadly, we have a Prime Minister who has said absolutely nothing about this. Not only has he not said anything about the gender pay gap, but since he started his prime ministership he hasn't said anything about a gender issue. We've had 61 women killed so far this year from family and domestic violence, mostly by partners or former partners. It's more this year than it was in the whole of last year and it's only the start of November. The Prime Minister has said nothing about that either. He's silent on the gender pay gap and he's silent on the epidemic of domestic violence against women. He's silent for 50 per cent of the population. If he can't speak out on those issues and show leadership, he doesn't deserve to be in that role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have suggestions for him on how he can fix the gender pay gap. For a start, he can show some leadership. He can increase resourcing for the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, he can strengthen their powers and he can mandate that they force employers to do something about the gender pay gap once they work out they've got one. It's no good reporting on it and then doing absolutely nothing. The law should require them to do something. It should make that gender pay gap public and make those companies disclose so that the public can use their power as consumers or as potential workers to make decisions about whether or not they'll support that business. We can prohibit the use of those pay gag clauses that employers in the private sector use to make sure that people can't talk about their pay. Those clauses disguise the even worse pay gap in the private sector. We can make that reporting cover the Public Service. The government said they want it done voluntarily. Let's actually make that an obligation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many other things we can do. We can give workers the right for flexible workplaces. We can extend paid parental leave and we can pay super on it. We can look at valuing the unpaid care work that still falls predominantly on the shoulders of women, disproportionately. We can make child care more affordable and more accessible. We can make superannuation fairer; we can change the way tax is paid on it and we can pay it no matter how small a woman's wage. There are things that can be done to fix gender inequality and fix the gender pay gap, and it's about time that we saw some leadership from either of the big parties in this place to do just that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  I have repeatedly called for the terms of reference for the royal commission into banking to be extended to include examination of the conduct of administrators and insolvency practitioners, particularly where these entities are acting against farmers. I've also called for them to include the dispute resolution process of financial service entities, to extend the reporting period and to increase funding for the royal commission to allow it to hear all submissions and to undertake these additional investigations. However, despite the unanimous support of the Senate, I and the victims of banking misconduct continue to wait for government to implement this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key element of the royal commission into institutional child abuse was its preparedness to hear firsthand accounts of victims. More than 6,000 individual stories gave a human face to the tales of abuse and gave victims a chance to publicly name their tormentors, beginning the process of justice. Despite receiving 9,000 submissions, only 27 victims of banks have been heard. My efforts to address this have so far fallen on deaf ears. The victims of financial abuse cannot wait anymore. Tonight, using the opportunity presented by this adjournment debate, I will begin the process of recounting the stories of individual bank victims for all Australians to hear and to be preserved for all time in the record of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of the Australian parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This evening I begin with two heart-rending human tragedies of the great people of the land who fed our nation but were ruined by the callous greed of the banks. The first is the case of the A family. I will not reveal the actual name, to protect those concerned from further victimisation, but I can give the identity of the farmer and the banks should anyone wish to know. Mr and Mrs A had a term loan limit of $5 million. He was already paying 7.98 per cent on the $5 million loan. The interest totalled $399,000 per year. He then had some unexpected bills and was $231 over his $5 million limit and did not pay it out for some time. So what would you expect his penalty charge to be? First, he attracted a three per cent per annum interest rate on not just the $231 but the total balance of $5,231,000, which is $411 a day. This means that the interest rate on the $231 is 178 per cent per day. Multiply this by 365 days and the annual interest rate is 64,942 per cent on that $231. Over the whole year the farmer would pay $150,000 higher interest for only being $231 over his limit. The bank involved has stated to one of my staff that it charges penalty interest rates along these lines all the time. Is this a practice the government encourages banks to keep doing and to avoid paying redress on, because it has not extended the royal commission to look at this case?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second example is a case the royal commission has not investigated either, despite it being submitted to the royal commission. The second case is of a homeowner, Mr B. Mr B is now destitute and living in a $150 caravan. Mr B was $758 in arrears on his $500,000 home loan. His late payment fee was five per cent per annum. But that was not charged on the $758, as we would expect, but on the whole loan balance of $500,000. In this case, the homeowner was charged a late payment fee of $25,000 per annum or $68.50 a day. This is an annual late payment fee of 3,298 per cent on his $758 in arrears. My question to the government is: (1) since the royal commission has not investigated this issue or the lending organisation involved, is it fair to assume the royal commission is not interested in this sort of immoral lending practice and (2) how will the victim, who now lives in a $150 caravan, be able to get redress for the exploitation of the lender that caused him to default, thereby losing his house and his ability to get justice?</span>
