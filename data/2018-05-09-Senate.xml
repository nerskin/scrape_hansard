I take issue with what the minister said yesterday in reply to this concern, which was along the lines that it would only apply in the case of an actually accrued debt. I can't recall exactly how the minister framed it. But, in that context, I need to ask the minister this specifically: if someone is paid child support and they are on a low income, how would the problem of them acquiring a debt be addressed when it is unsustainable for them to pay it back to the person who paid the child support reasonably and it was received in good faith?</span>

This measure does not create debt. The debt already exists. Can I just underline that. The debt already exists, whether this measure passes or not. The important thing about this measure is that it provides a mechanism for people to identify the debt early rather than letting it mount while they go through the current lengthy process. So I underline: the debt already exists; this is about the process. This is about a mechanism for identification of that debt early in the piece, rather than letting it, as I said, mount up while you go through the current lengthy process. I add that the measure will allow overpayments or underpayments to be identified and addressed earlier. This means that the overpayment or underpayment would be less than under the current process, where debts can accrue while the lengthy assessment takes place. It will not change how these overpayments or underpayments are settled.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  Our concern, which I don't think the minister has addressed, highlights what happens when debt accrues. For example, the median income of child support recipients in Tasmania is only $22,195 a year. They have extremely low median incomes, whereas child support recipients in the ACT have, on average, $42,000 in median income. You can see that even a small reduction in child support or other payments can have a big impact on a family in terms of their cost of living. We believe it is unfair to place the child support recipient in an even more precarious financial situation because of another person's mistake, which is what we're talking about here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that there is also a need for legislative change, but sometimes honest mistakes do happen, which is why we believe it's important that the Child Support Registrar can amend a child support assessment—and this is the effect of the amendments we will put in to follow these ones if we fail in knocking this out—so that it reflects the true financial situation of both parents. An example given to us was of someone who'd had an incorrect tax assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that the bill as currently drafted does not provide adequate protections to ensure that retrospective determinations cannot place a child support recipient and their children in a precarious situation. These are important and sensitive issues. This is why we have amendments before this place which would give the Senate more time to carefully consider the way to make this change. The amendment that we are debating removes schedule 1, part 2—which deals with changes to amended tax assessments—from the bill. Let's be clear: I would like the chamber to support this amendment.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  I am very disappointed in the outcome of that amendment. What we see here is the capacity of this bill to now change child support assessments retrospectively, which is a ridiculous and appalling state of affairs. I am disappointed also in our crossbench colleagues for failing to take proper note of the importance of this issue. I implore you—there is yet another opportunity for you to fix this. Rather than giving this chamber time to go away and deal with this issue by splitting the bill, we are now forced to pursue substantive amendments to change the technical detail of how the registrar deals with these debts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply unfair, from Labor's perspective, that child support assessments not be based on an accurate reflection of the income and financial circumstances of both parents. That is what the bill before us does. The legislation allows the registrar to change child support assessments retrospectively. If, for example, a tax assessment is changed, that creates a retrospective debt which can put undue financial hardship on either of the two parties in such circumstances. What we are asking for with this amendment is to allow the registrar to consider hardship in those circumstances so that, if a retrospective debt is indeed raised, the historical overpayment is reassessed and is able to be a hardship provision so that neither parent is put under undue stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, we know parents who receive child support can be on very low incomes. If a child support assessment changes and the family that has been paid money because of a tax assessment needs to pay back money to the payer, it can place very much undue hardship on that household. It is simply not fair for a parent who has received child support in good faith and has spent it on their children to find out that, through no fault of their own, that money must now be repaid. It is simply unsustainable for us to consider having such a big impact on a family's ability to meet the cost of living. This is why we are moving this amendment today to part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill to attempt to deal with this issue. Rather than giving the Senate and the government time to go away and deal with this issue, in this amendment we've thought carefully about how we should go about fixing this. This amendment permits the Child Support Registrar to change a child support assessment, following the amendment of an income tax assessment, prospectively and retrospectively in limited circumstances. A child support assessment can only be made retrospective if either the amendment was due to fraud or evasion or the registrar is satisfied that changing the administrative assessment retrospectively would not cause the parent unjustified financial hardship, having regard to the financial situation of the other parent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think this is a reasonable way forward. It specifies that the registrar must amend an administrative assessment in order to take account of an amended tax assessment. We're also seeking to insert a provision that specifies that the Commissioner of Taxation must inform the Child Support Registrar of an amended tax assessment as soon as practicable after it is made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask our friends on the crossbench to have some regard to the circumstances of families who may find themselves in the dire situation of needing to pay back money that they thought they had legitimately received. I understand that there's unfairness in this for both parties, but it has to be done properly with consideration for the financial hardship and the financial burden on those households. Think about the fact that we are creating retrospective debts here. I ask the chamber for some consideration on behalf of those families. Accordingly, I seek leave to move opposition amendments (1) to (7) together on sheet 8397.</span>

As we indicated, and as I indicated on behalf of the Greens in my second contribution, we are deeply concerned about the impact of this particular part and we share the concern about the fact that the previous amendments were not supported. We think it would have been better to have taken this particular part out of this bill and dealt with it separately when we had had proper time to consider the amendments. However, that was not the will of the chamber, so we think this is the next best option—that is, that we support these amendments and move to protect those people who are accidentally caught up in this through no fault of their own. This is not about the payees. It's not their potential mistake. We think that these are practical, sensible measures that will provide that measure of protection for those people who are in fact innocently caught up in this and who may potentially end up with a debt which they are not responsible for.</span>

Single mothers—let's name it—will be caught up in these changes. These people, by the way, have been ignored in the budget. A large number of them are on income support, as we also heard yesterday. These are the real live people that we are seeking to protect in supporting these amendments so that they are not caught up in dealing with the impact of a debt through no fault of their own. We will be supporting these amendments that offer a level of protection to those people.</span>

Can I repeat this point: this measure does not create debt; the debt already exists. Whether this measure passes or not, the important thing is to provide a mechanism for people to identify that debt early rather than letting it mount while going through the current lengthy process. The measure will allow overpayments or underpayments to be identified and addressed earlier, and this will mean that the overpayment or underpayment would be less than under the current process, where debts can accrue while lengthy assessments take place. It will not change how these overpayments or underpayments are settled.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I am introducing legislation to facilitate the complete establishment of the Home Affairs portfolio, which brings together Australia's security, law enforcement, criminal intelligence and emergency management functions under the direction of one senior minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill amends 36 Acts to make Ministerial and Departmental functions and powers clear on the face of legislation affected by Machinery of Government (MoG) changes to establish the Home Affairs portfolio and related changes strengthening the Attorney-General's oversight of intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies. Measures in the bill implement the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in its reports into the bill and the additional proposed Government amendments, tabled on 26 February and 28 March 2018 respectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new Department of Home Affairs is now responsible for setting strategies and coordinating policies on counterterrorism and violent extremism, counter foreign interference, serious and organised crime, cybersecurity, border security, immigration and social cohesion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The portfolio includes the Department of Home Affairs as well as the Australian Federal Police, AUSTRAC and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ASIO will be included within the portfolio after the passage of this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each of the intelligence and law enforcement agencies will retain their full statutory independence. This structure is modelled loosely on the arrangements in the United Kingdom and, of course, their Home Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, we are strengthening our intelligence architecture by creating an Office of National Intelligence in the Prime Minister's portfolio and empowering it with a leadership role in our intelligence community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Modelled loosely on its US counterpart, the ONI will not only provide analysis and assessments but also advise on priorities, improve coordination and raise performance accountability across the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these initiatives represent the most far-reaching reorganisation of our national security architecture since the Hope royal commissions of the late seventies and early eighties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Why now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To those who argue that the system is not broken, I can reassure you that you are absolutely right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have been incredibly well served by our intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has not been a single point of crisis that has led politicians to scramble in hasty reaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But that is precisely the point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are not going to sit here avoiding improvements that could be made and waiting for a crisis that exposes the need for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If I could quote a former head of ASIO, Paul O'Sullivan, speaking immediately after the Prime Minister's announcement to establish a Home Affairs portfolio, he said, 'Improvements should be made before something is broken.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Or to quote his successor, and also former head of ASIS, David Irvine, 'Too often, governments are only stirred to improve national security or law enforcement capabilities after some catastrophic failure.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms are driven by the reality that the threat environment we face is rapidly changing and, it has to be said, worsening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fact is we are being tested, stretched. States are adapting. Terrorists are adapting. Serious and organised crime gangs are adapting. And so must we.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">New threats are emerging which did not exist when the security architecture was designed in the 1970s. Others have evolved to be barely recognisable from what we knew back then. Much of this evolution has been enabled by technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms mean that our national security system will be stronger, more resilient and more responsive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, at the same time that we are strengthening our security arrangements, we are also strengthening integrity and oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In his enhanced role as first law officer and minister for integrity—that will not be his title, but that is essentially a good description of the role—the Attorney-General will assume responsibility for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And the Attorney will continue to sign off on all ASIO warrants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are some who believe security and freedom to be binary opposites, as if there exists a universe in which you could have one without the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To the contrary, I am sure that all honourable members agree that these dual objectives can be—in fact must be—mutually reinforcing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'Freedom,' said the philosopher Karl Popper, 'defeats itself if it is unlimited.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Terrorists, hostile intelligence agencies, people smugglers and criminal syndicates—from drug peddlers to paedophile rings—are all probing for our vulnerabilities, online and off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Border security</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have seen extraordinary progress in our efforts on border security. There has not been a single people smuggling boat reach our shores in over 1,200 days. No deaths at sea, no illegal people smuggling trade, no kids in detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compare this achievement with the frayed social cohesion that you see elsewhere in the world when nations lose control of their borders and fail to invest, as we do, in the integration of migrants who arrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tragically, in our own country, a collapse of border security emboldened 50,000 individuals to entrust their lives to people smugglers. This resulted in over 1,200 deaths at sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We cannot afford to let this happen again. We will not let it happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, we have been able to increase our humanitarian program as well as resettle 12,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This would not have been possible without our strong border management policies and high levels of public confidence in our well-managed migration system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When we look around the world—with its broken borders and 65 million displaced people—we see that this is no time for complacency. People smugglers are constantly testing our resolve. I want to pay credit to the work of the Department of Home Affairs, the work of Operation Sovereign Borders and the work of the Australian Border Force, and the leadership that has been shown by the minister and, of course, by his predecessor, now Treasurer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The far-reaching reforms the Prime Minister introduced last year align with our vision for how we will engage with the world—from the foreign policy white paper to the defence white paper to the Cyber Security Strategy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our reforms will strengthen the Australian Cyber Security Centre's role as the backbone of our enhanced cybersecurity capabilities. The operational experts in the ACSC will work closely with the policymakers in Home Affairs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms will enhance the benefits of the nine tranches of national security legislation the coalition has taken through parliament since August 2014.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From combating foreign fighters and preventing terror attacks at home, to the telecommunications sector security reforms and establishing the Critical Infrastructure Centre—the establishment of the Home Affairs portfolio provides a lasting foundation to make best use of these reforms and safeguard Australian lives and interests.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes to our national security agencies and arrangements are the most far reaching in our history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the creation of the Home Affairs portfolio bringing together our law enforcement, counterterrorism, counter foreign interference, border security, transport security, intelligence and cybersecurity capabilities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, the Attorney-General will enhance his role as first law officer.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  For over a century Labor has demonstrated its understanding that the paramount responsibility for parliamentarians is to keep our community safe and our nation secure. We demonstrate this in practical ways by working in a bipartisan fashion, whether in government or in opposition, to ensure that our security and law enforcement agencies have the powers and resources they need to keep our community safe. We may not always agree with our political opponents on how Australians can be best protected; however, we engage constructively in a political debate about matters of this kind. These are debates that all healthy democracies ought to have. And because we do not believe that national security should ever be manipulated or exploited for partisan purposes, we do not seek to politicise any disagreements that we may have with the government on national security matters. We always seek to resolve those disagreements through constructive and considered debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that it is the prerogative of the government of the day to decide how it wishes to organise the executive government and its agencies. The present bill, the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, is essentially a procedural bill that implements the decision of the Turnbull government to radically reorganise some of the nation's national security and law enforcement agencies. This bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, on which I sit. That committee recommended that the bill be passed subject to an amendment being made relating to the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. In light of that recommendation and because this is essentially a procedural bill, Labor supports the passage of this bill. However, we wish to place on record several concerns about these changes to our national security and law enforcement framework that the bill implements. We do this because the machinery-of-government changes that this bill helps to legally implement are not minor or technical. They are a significant re-working of our national security and federal law enforcement framework and this is openly acknowledged by the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister declared in his second reading speech on this bill last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… these initiatives represent the most far-reaching reorganisation of our national security architecture since the Hope royal commissions of the late seventies and early eighties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our primary concern is that the government has struggled to explain why the sweeping changes to be brought about by this bill are required at all. Our national security agencies are recognised as highly effective. It is also recognised that they cooperate effectively with one another. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last year a comprehensive review of our intelligence services was conducted by Mr Michael L'Estrange AO and Mr Stephen Merchant PSM and that review was released in July last year. The review did not, in any way, recommend the kinds of changes that the Turnbull government is now putting in place. From the Labor side, we are concerned that the reasons for this experiment have not been sufficiently explained by the Prime Minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that the concept of a Department of Home Affairs is not new. It was previously considered by Prime Minister Howard, by Prime Minister Rudd and by Prime Minister Abbott. After careful consideration, each of those prime ministers rejected the proposal. Yet this is the proposal that the member for Wentworth is now enacting; and it is not entirely clear what has changed, and the government has not sought to explain it. One effect of the new arrangements is to concentrate power that was once shared between a number of ministers and their departments into a single minister and a new super-department called the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most democratic nations are careful to avoid the concentration of power in a single entity or a single person. Most of those nations favour systems with checks and balances, and this is particularly the case with the kinds of coercive powers and intrusive capabilities that our law enforcement and national security agencies necessarily exercise. Concentrating those powers and capabilities under a single department and its minister can weaken the checks and balances that are needed to prevent citizens from the inappropriate or unlawful exercise of those powers and capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of our most senior security experts have pointed out that the concentration of power might also weaken our national security by reducing the contestability of key decisions. Under the arrangements being put in place by this bill, a single minister, presently the member for Dickson, Mr Dutton, will alone be responsible for complex decisions that until now have been debated by multiple ministers who have shared responsibility for our nation's security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that the government's approach to legislating the various changes to the existing acts necessary for the creation of the Department of Home Affairs has been somewhat haphazard. The government first stated its intention to establish the Department of Home Affairs on 17 July, yet it took until 7 December to second read this bill—which at that time amended only four acts of parliament. Subsequently, following the government's disclosure in evidence to the PJCIS that there were a further 33 acts of parliament that required amendment in order to effect the creation of the portfolio, the Attorney-General proposed a further 311 amendments to the primary legislation. These additional amendments were considered by the PJCIS, which recommended that they be passed. At paragraph 1.27 of its report on this bill the committee stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee notes that machinery of government changes are a matter for the government of the day. As such, it is not within the remit of the Committee to consider the broader policy decisions behind the changes, but to scrutinise the amendments as proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the Senate reflects those additional amendments proposed by the government at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, and consistent with the intelligence committee's view, I reiterate that Labor acknowledges the prerogative of the executive to determine the machinery of government. We support this bill as implementing changes brought about under that prerogative. Labor will carefully monitor the operation of these new arrangements. We will listen carefully to the advice of our security agencies as these arrangements take effect to make certain that the new framework operates as the government intends and is in fact of benefit to our nation's security. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  I rise to speak on the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. As colleagues would know, this bill establishes the Home Affairs portfolio and seeks to give effect to the allocation of ministerial powers following the establishment of the new Home Affairs department. It amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The majority of changes to establish the Home Affairs portfolio have been made through amendments to the Administrative Arrangements Order. This bill addresses specific matters that could not be dealt with without legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it was announced in July last year that this super-sized department of Australia's security and immigration agencies would occur, and be led by Minister Peter Dutton, I said at the time that this would move Australia closer to being a police state. I stand by those comments. This is a dangerous proposal, a dangerous move by government, and it continues Australia's walk ever more rapidly down the road to authoritarianism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens will be opposing this bill. The government has abjectly failed to give satisfactory reasons for the changes, and these changes have not been recommended by any review. The government is engaged in a thought bubble here, and I have no doubt that it is being led by the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton. I note that the government is proposing amendments to this bill, based on recommendations from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Amendments (16), (17) and (19) implement recommendation 1 of the first report by ensuring that only the Prime Minister may request the Inspector-General to undertake certain inquiries under section 9 of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Hon. Margaret Stone, had deep concerns regarding the initial proposal that would have given the Attorney-General the same powers as the Prime Minister to compel the Inspector-General to undertake an inquiry. The Greens won't be opposing the government's amendments. I also note that Senator Patrick, on behalf of the Centre Alliance, has proposed an amendment relating to the oversight of intelligence agencies. The Greens will be supporting Senator Patrick's amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of the new home affairs department is one of the clearest examples of this government's ongoing attempts to change Australia's culture and to turn Australia into a more closed and frightened place. They are doing this for a reason. They are doing it because they know, through careful study of history, that, if you can scare people enough, more and more of them will acquiesce to the erosion of their fundamental rights and freedoms, purportedly to support national security measures. This government, and previous governments of both political stripes, have deliberately set out to create fear in the hearts and minds of the Australian people, with the intent of lessening opposition to the ongoing erosion of fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties in this country. The Australian Greens will fight this all the way. This move, the creation of the home affairs department, is something that will reshape Australia's entire immigration, intelligence and security framework to become more hostile, suspicious and secretive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some Labor MPs have expressed concern about the concentration of too much power in Mr Dutton's hands, but what's missing from Labor is a commitment to reverse these changes. We haven't heard the Labor Party say that they oppose the creation of the Department of Home Affairs, and we have not heard the Labor Party say that, if they win government at the next election, they will reverse the changes. That is what we need to hear Labor say. I listened carefully to Labor's contribution in the House yesterday and the contribution from Senator McAllister today, and we have not heard Labor say that these changes will be reversed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to Australia's immigration, intelligence and security systems becoming more hostile, suspicious and secretive, we have a minister, Mr Dutton, who has continually shown that he cannot be trusted to responsibly exercise the powers he already has, yet the creation of the home affairs department and this enabling legislation simply concentrates more power into the hands of Mr Dutton. I place very firmly on the record that the Australian Greens do not trust Mr Dutton to responsibly exercise the new authority and concentration of powers he will have. We've seen his track record in Australia's offshore detention system on Manus Island and Nauru. I've been to Manus Island many times and seen with my own eyes, and felt with my own heart, the harm that is being caused to innocent people, deliberately, by the Australian government—with bipartisan support from the opposition, I might add. The human cost and the human misery on Manus Island—which I know of through my direct experience there—and, I have no doubt, the equal harm being done to people on Nauru, the equal human cost and the equal misery, show very clearly indeed that we are right not to trust Mr Dutton with the extra concentration of powers that the creation of the Department of Home Affairs has afforded him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At stake here is far more than the administrative arrangements or which minister sits in front of which Senate estimates committee. This is nothing other than an attempt to use state apparatus to erode fundamental rights and freedoms, to change the nature of Australia and to rebuild it in line with Mr Dutton's fears and prejudices. The net effect of these changes is a department that is technically responsible for national security and immigration and resettlement—but I note that it is outsourcing and deprioritising the latter function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget last night, we saw tens of millions of dollars stripped away from refugee supports in this country and an extension of waiting times for refugees to access crucial and critical government services. Again this government shows its lack of heart, its lack of compassion, its lack of basic human dignity, not only in this bill but in the budget that was presented last night. Remember, last year Minister Dutton tried to change citizenship laws in this country to force people to wait longer before they could make applications to become citizens, to speak university-level English before they could become citizens and to sit patronising values tests before they could call themselves Australians. These changes, which the Greens led the charge to ultimately defeat in the Senate last year, came as hundreds of citizenship-processing staff were being sacked by the department. Consequently, people are now waiting far, far longer than previously before their applications for citizenship are processed. This is not a coincidence. Mr Dutton demands loyalty from potential citizens and in turn treats potential citizens with utter contempt. More recently, the government has massively increased the amount of money that people have to own before they can sponsor a relative to come to Australia. This will have the effect of restricting family reunions to the well-off and is ultimately a cut to migration by stealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a minister who has a history of dishonesty and a history of utter disrespect and contempt for basic human rights and utter contempt for the rule of law. Those things make him completely unfit to sit at the top of such a powerful national security agency as the Department of Home Affairs. He has overseen a regime of deliberate brutality on Manus Island and Nauru. He has denied the people he has detained the chance to rebuild their shattered lives, not just in Australia but in New Zealand. He has tried to deprive suicidal children of badly needed psychiatric care in Australia. He repeatedly acts outside or beyond his powers to deport people, and, when his decisions are overturned by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the courts, he lashes out at the AAT and the judiciary. His latest pot shot at the judiciary shows an alarming contempt for the rule of law. His suggestion of public reflection is a step towards the direct election of judges—an alarming proposition—in this country. Judges and magistrates should be independent experts in the law, not populist politicians. Again, this suggestion is a dangerous erosion of the rule of law, and ultimately the Prime Minister needs to bring his out-of-control minister to heel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it bluntly, Mr Dutton doesn't like judges because he is sick of being held to account by our courts. At every turn, he's sought an expansion of powers, which has been opposed only at the very outside margins by Labor, if at all, to increase the powers of security agencies to surveil, to interrogate and to deport people. All of these changes are happening at a whirlwind pace. The dust has barely settled on the newly created Australian Border Force, and it is long past time for reflection on what the purpose and scope of Australia's Immigration Department should be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to see what a home affairs department will look like in action, the treatment of a Biloela family in March gives us a frightening vision. A mother, a father and their two young daughters had their home raided in the pre-dawn hours by Border Force, police and Serco security guards. They were told they had 10 minutes to pack up their things, before they were bundled into vans and locked up in an immigration detention centre in Melbourne, where they remain to this day. This is frightening stuff—frightening stuff indeed. Everything about this scenario—the combination of private and public security forces, the dawn raid only a matter of hours after a visa had expired and the complete lack of basic compassion—is the product of a department and a minister that are unrecognisable from just a short decade ago. This country is walking ever more rapidly down the road to authoritarianism and totalitarianism, and Mr Dutton's consolidation of power is central to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time after time this government demonstrates its disregard and contempt for the rule of law—and that is one of the early warning signs of fascism. We are in a very dangerous period in our country's history. We are sleepwalking down a dangerous pathway. The creation of the home affairs department is a significant step down that dangerous pathway and will be fought and opposed all the way by the Australian Greens. It's a shame that Labor have decided to support this bill. I'm very disappointed in the Labor Party for doing this. They had a chance here to stand up against this concentration of powers, to stand up against this ongoing erosion of fundamental rights and freedoms in this country, but yesterday and today they have squibbed it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to move away from expanding government powers, from increasing the concentration of government powers. We need to be wary about the loss of privacy that citizens are facing, the massive increase in the surveillance state, and, ultimately, we need to start building into our legislative framework protections for people's fundamental rights. That is why we need a charter of rights in this country. We are the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of charter or bill of rights either in our statute books or in our Constitution. This lack of a charter of rights is part of the reason the government are able to get away with the changes they are proposing today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concentrations of power, like the one this government has engaged in with the creation of the home affairs department, are extremely dangerous. They can lead to a reduction in accountability, reductions in transparency and reductions in the contestability of decisions—and, ultimately, that is bad news for Australian citizens who value fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in this country. This move by the government, disappointingly supported by the Labor Party, will be opposed all the way by the Australian Greens. What we need to hear from Labor is a commitment to reverse these changes and, disappointingly, we have heard anything but.</span>

A short time ago the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, answering questions referred to it by the Senate on 6 December last year, held that Katy Gallagher was incapable of being chosen as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory at the election on 2 July 2016 by reason of section 44(i) of the Constitution. Precedent would suggest that the resulting vacancy will be filled by a special count of the ballot under the supervision of the court. I will table the orders of the court in due course.</span>

Of course, the Australian Labor Party will respect the totality of that decision. I only make two points in relation to Senator Gallagher. The first is that she is a woman of great integrity who always acted in accordance with the advice given to her, her understanding of the legal issues, and always acted in good faith. The second point I make is this. Former Senator Katy Gallagher was an outstanding senator and an outstanding representative of the community and the people of the ACT. She is an important part of Labor's Senate leadership team and she's too good to lose.</span>

As the Prime Minister announced in July 2017, the establishment of the Home Affairs portfolio is part of the most significant reforms to Australia's national intelligence and domestic security arrangements in decades. It is complemented by a strengthened role for the Attorney-General in oversighting our intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to extend parliamentary scrutiny to the operation of Australia's national security and intelligence agencies. The bill itself proposes a number of amendments to give effect to the allocation of ministerial powers following the establishment of a Home Affairs portfolio and to make changes relating to the Attorney-General's oversight of intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies. Centre Alliance has no objection to the bill. In this regard, we note the observations in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's report that machinery-of-government changes are a matter for the government of the day and that the contents of the bill are broadly consistent with the government's intention regarding the creation of the Home Affairs portfolio. Like the PJCIS, we also note the Prime Minister's statement that the Attorney-General, as first law officer of the Commonwealth, will take on a suite of oversight responsibilities with our intelligence community. In addition, the Attorney-General will continue to sign off on all ASIO warrants. That statutory provision should certainly be retained.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the Senate today is, of course, another in a long line of bills that have come before the parliament since 2001 and have profoundly reshaped Australia's national security and intelligence arrangements. Much of this legislation has expanded the powers of those agencies and their ability to collect information at home and abroad and to conduct their operations. More legislation relating to espionage and official secrets and issues of foreign interference in Australia is yet to be debated by the Senate. Those bills are more contentious than the one that is being considered today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, Centre Alliance considers it imperative to improve parliamentary oversight of Australia's intelligence agencies as they face greater challenges and are given more resources and powers to intrude into the lives of Australian citizens. Australia's 10 national security and intelligence agencies employ more than 7,000 people and spend well over $2 billion per annum while they accumulate massive amounts of data at home and abroad. As the intelligence agencies have expanded, the mechanisms of accountability and review have received much less attention and fewer resources. The government's commitment in the budget of additional funds to the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is welcomed, but that comes after more than a decade of relative neglect where the intelligence and national security community has grown like Topsy. Greater parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence agencies is long overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent proposals for the further expansion of the intelligence community's access to the electronic records of Australian citizens highlight the need for parliament to maintain a careful watch over not only the administration and expenditure of our intelligence services but intelligence policy and operations as well. At present, the PJCIS is prohibited by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 from reviewing intelligence-gathering priorities and operations of the Australian intelligence agencies or the assessments and reports they produce. The committee is barred from examining sources of information, operational activities and methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by intelligence and national security agencies. Significantly, the PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by ministers that regulate the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PJCIS cannot properly hold these agencies accountable if the parliament continues to ban its own committee from reviewing its operational performance. This is not the approach taken in other countries, including Australia's closest intelligence partners. In the United States, high-powered congressional committees have the authority to reach far into operational matters. Those inquiries are accepted by the US intelligence community as necessary and appropriate. The approach taken by the new Canadian National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians provides a good model for Australia to follow. Canada is one of our Five Eyes intelligence partners and has an intelligence and national security committee not dissimilar to our own. Under Canada's National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act 2017, the Canadian parliament's intelligence community can review:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment moved by Centre Alliance today adapts the model provided by the Canadian parliamentary oversight legislation with an additional safeguard provided by our own Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The amendment removes most, though not all, of the current legislative constraints on the scope of the PJCIS's inquiries. It does retain existing prohibitions on reviewing information provided by foreign governments, where that government does not consent to the disclosure of that information. It also retains the prohibition on conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of designated intelligence and national security agencies, as those complaints are appropriately dealt with by the IGIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are details of intelligence operations involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. Accordingly, the relevant minister may certify that a review by the PJCIS relates to an ongoing operation and that review would interfere with the proper performance of the relevant body or its functions or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. If this is the case, the committee will be required to cease or suspend the review. However, the committee may refer the minister's decision to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who, within 30 days, must review the matter and consider whether the activity is an ongoing operation and whether it is reasonable to conclude that a review by the committee would interfere with the proper performance by the relevant bodies of its function or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the inspector-general advises the committee that the activity is not an ongoing operation or the review would not cause interference with the proper functioning of the relevant body or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations, the committee may proceed with the review or commence a new review into the activity. The amendment thus adapts the Canadian model with the independent Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security able to act if needed as the umpire between the minister responsible for the intelligence agencies and the PJCIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for an expansion to the PJCIS's role has been recognised by others in the Senate. Former Senator John Faulkner urged this broad reform. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, similarly, has rightly observed that parliamentarians cannot outsource their duties to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. I agree entirely. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions then something is wrong with the relationship between the intelligence community and the parliament that it ultimately means to serve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of these amendments is to put this proposal to the government in a form that cannot be ignored or put into a pile of private members' bills that will never see the light of day. That is the status of the Labor opposition's private member's bill that has similarly proposed an amendment on expanding the remit of the PJCIS's reviews. These amendments put the proposal to the government in a way that cannot be ignored. The government and the national security bureaucrats who've always resisted parliamentary scrutiny will have to respond, if they want the proposed changes to the Home Affairs portfolio to proceed. They will have to engage positively with the idea that greater parliamentary scrutiny is required to ensure that both national security and our individual liberties and privacies are properly protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance moves these amendments without any narrow interest. Neither I nor my colleagues Senator Griff and the member for Mayo are members of the PJCIS, and we don't imagine we will be any time soon, but we do think some amendments to the role and the authority of the PJCIS, along the lines of the Canadian legislation, are essential, if we are to continue to have the full confidence in the operations of our national security and intelligence agencies, and their relationship with this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's intelligence communities are not infallible. In the future their performance will be tested in a much more demanding security environment, and the Australian parliament will need to subject our intelligence agencies to much closer scrutiny than has been the case in the past. The Senate is scheduled to debate more bills relating to Australia's intelligence agencies, espionage and secrecy laws as well as measures to deal with covert foreign interference in Australian politics. As the government seeks to further expand the powers of the intelligence community, equal consideration must be given to extending the parliamentary oversight of those agencies. These amendments will assist the government in its agenda to increase the effectiveness of the intelligence services by providing the community with a level of confidence in its operations. I commend the amendments to the Senate.</span>

That role now includes oversight of some aspects of the new Department of Home Affairs. The issue of oversight was also canvassed in detail in the review of our intelligence services conducted last year by Mr L'Estrange and Mr Merchant. I have sought repeated assurance, since that report was published, from the government that further oversight measures in line with the recommendations of that review will be forthcoming. I'll say it again here: the opposition expects a meaningful and substantive response to the recommendations of that review in relation to oversight, and a response of that kind is still not available. The government's response should enable public examination of these important issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a longstanding commitment to modernising and improving the legislation setting out the powers of the PJCIS. I thank Senator Patrick for his acknowledgement of that in his remarks earlier. We drafted a bill to put our views about this into effect—that is, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015. That bill is presently on the Senate <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, and our Senate leader has asked me to have carriage of that bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our general approach is this: as the powers and resources of the Australian intelligence community increase, so too must our capacity for scrutiny. That includes effective scrutiny by the parliament. We will always work to ensure that any new powers conferred on police and security agencies are accompanied by appropriate oversight and accountability mechanisms. This is important for a number of reasons: firstly, it helps to ensure that the new powers are exercised only for the reasons they are conferred and in the manner prescribed; secondly, oversight and accountability help to ensure that the Australian public has confidence and respect for the agencies that are protecting them. And that is a relationship with very practical consequences. A good relationship between the citizenry and our police and security agencies is actually essential to the flow of information that has proved so important to effective counterterrorism and law enforcement operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are naturally supportive of much of the intent behind Senator Patrick's amendment. We are grateful for the opportunity that the amendment provided for the shadow Attorney-General to discuss the issues relating to oversight and the role of the PJCIS with Senator Patrick. We regret that because of their form—namely, an amendment to the current bill—Senator Patrick's proposals were not able to be fully considered and were not considered in the public hearings of the PJCIS. There has not been scope or time for proper consultation, nor for consideration of the operation and consequences of Senator Patrick's proposals. Given that, we are not able to support the amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we do re-affirm our commitment to modernising and improving the operation of the PJCIS and ensuring that there are appropriate levels of parliamentary scrutiny for the operation of the AIC. We look forward to working with Senator Patrick and all members of the Senate in progressing the measures embodied in our bill and in Senator Patrick's amendment. We would welcome cooperation from the government in doing so.</span>

On the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security: I acknowledge the comments made by Senator McAllister and I acknowledge that there is a bill currently on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> which proposes to make changes to the way the PJCIS is structured and operates. When this was debated in the previous parliament, the Australian Greens moved an amendment that a senator from the crossbench be included on the PJCIS. I want to remind Senator McAllister of that and note that the crossbench in the Senate is increasing in size, election by election. The Australian Greens have a very clear view, given the ongoing increase in powers and authority of Australia's intelligence and security agencies, that the crossbench in the Senate ought to be represented on the PJCIS. I hope that Labor brings forward the legislation for debate at some stage in the current parliament, and I can give informal notice today that, again, we would seek to amend that legislation to provide for a crossbench seat on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But because it will increase scrutiny and oversight of Australia's intelligence and security agencies at a time when on an ongoing basis their powers are being increased and concentrated, we believe that Senator Patrick's amendment is a sensible amendment. We've always supported stronger parliamentary oversight and we will do so today by supporting Senator Patrick's amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  Labor supports the Investigation and Prosecution Measures Bill 2017. This bill amends the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004. Schedule 1 of the bill provides the correct references to the officers and titles following the 2016 restructuring of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. Schedule 2 of the bill extends the powers, functions and duties of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the laws of Norfolk Island. We welcome these uncontroversial reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales ICAC was established in 1988. Its principal function is to investigate alleged corruption at state and local government levels. It covers parliamentarians, local councillors, public servants, staff of universities and employees of state owned corporations. It has served the people of New South Wales well and, in so doing, has contributed to the maintenance of the trust of the people of New South Wales in public institutions in that state. However, in 2016 the New South Wales parliament passed legislation which made structural rearrangements to the New South Wales ICAC. The ICAC now has a new structure of a chief commissioner supported by two part-time commissioners, and additional assistant commissioners if required. Consequently, the existing references in Commonwealth statutes require amendment to ensure consistency of references to the current structure of the ICAC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two issues of principle which arise as a result of these consequential amendments. The first is to note that the bill contributes to and enhances the continued cooperation between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales. This ensures consistency and accuracy of the law between the Commonwealth and New South Wales, a necessary exercise which everyone in this place would agree is a basic, if unexciting, requirement of governance. The second matter is one of reflection on the role of anticorruption measures in government. The New South Wales ICAC has been operating for three decades. Every state and territory either has an anticorruption body or is in the process of establishing one. The Commonwealth does not presently have a standalone anticorruption body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in this place would agree that Australians have a right to feel confident that their government at every level is open, transparent and free from corruption, and that elected representatives, public servants and persons providing services to the public under government contracts serve the people with integrity. However, in recent years, following a number of scandals under the Abbott and Turnbull governments, there has been a diminution of public faith in our Commonwealth institutions. That is why we announced at the beginning of this year that a Shorten Labor government will establish a national integrity commission: a new federal anticorruption body tasked with investigating allegations of serious corruption, stamping it out wherever it is found and educating the community about public sector integrity. Labor's national integrity commission will help to ensure the highest level of public administration and help to restore the essential element of Australia's trust in politics and the public sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think all Australians agree that it's time we hold our Commonwealth public officials to the standards of integrity and probity that the public rightly expect and create a single, broad-based body to ensure that this occurs. The Leader of the Opposition has already said that Labor is ready to work with the Liberals and any other interested parties to begin the task of establishing a national integrity commission straight away, and I reiterate that invitation now. I believe that good government means open and transparent government. Open government means that we govern with the trust of the people we serve. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I thank honourable senators for the contributions they've made to the debate on this bill. The Investigation and Prosecution Measures Bill 2017 makes three sets of amendments. Firstly, it amends the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 to ensure that the legislation supports a restructure of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. Secondly, it extends the functions, powers and duties of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the laws of Norfolk Island. Thirdly, it amends the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to provide for the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island to exercise its jurisdiction by sitting in other Australian jurisdictions and to address limitations on commencing prosecution of historical sex offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales plays a critical role in investigating, exposing and preventing corruption in the public sector. In November 2016 the New South Wales parliament passed the Independent Commission Against Corruption Amendment Act 2016. That act restructured the commission by replacing the former arrangement of a single commissioner and assistant commissioner with a full-time chief commissioner and two part-time commissioners. Assistant commissioners may also be appointed as required. The measures in the bill will make minor amendments to both the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 to ensure that the restructured commission is referenced properly in both of those acts. The act will retain the commission's substantive powers under those acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 provides the legal framework for specified intelligence and law enforcement agencies to access communications and data for the investigation of criminal offences and other activities that threaten safety and security. It permits eligible law enforcement and security agencies, including the commission, to obtain warrants to intercept communications and access stored data and communications, and to access telecommunications data subject to stringent legal tests and independent oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interceptions act invests certain provisions within the commission's specific authority when undertaking functions. The chief commissioner, for example, will be able to authorise members of the commission to receive information gathered under warrants and communicate intercepted information obtained by the commission to other agencies in limited circumstances. The amendments will allow the chief commissioner, a commissioner or an assistant commissioner to be certifying officers under the act. Certifying officers can, for example, be delegated the power to revoke interception and stored communication warrants, certify true copies of warrants and issue evidentiary certificates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Surveillance Devices Act 2004 governs the use of optical surveillance devices, listening devices, and data and tracking devices by law enforcement agencies. The act complements relevant surveillance devices laws of the states and territories by allowing law enforcement agencies such as the commission to obtain surveillance device warrants to help investigate federal offences and state offences with a federal aspect. The Surveillance Devices Act invests certain positions within the commission's specific authority when undertaking functions under the act. These provisions ensure the authorisations are valid and that the persons authorised under the act to undertake those functions can exercise these prescribed functions legally. The chief commissioner, will, for example, have the power to revoke surveillance device warrants and authorise executive-level officers to be authorising officers. Commissioners and assistant commissioners will also be designated as authorising officers under the bill. Authorising officers may, for example, issue emergency authorisations for the use of a surveillance device, authorise the use and retrieval of tracking advices without warrant in certain circumstances, and issue evidentiary certificates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will ensure that the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption is able to continue its valuable work and can access the investigative tools it needs to support its functions. In relation to the Norfolk Island Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983, on 1 July 2015 the Australian government took over responsibility for delivering local, state and Commonwealth services on Norfolk Island, which are proportionately equivalent to services which benefit mainland Australians. As part of this process it was important to review prosecution arrangements in order to align services with those services on mainland Australia and other external territories. The measures in the bill will allow the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to take over prosecutorial and related functions in relation to the laws of Norfolk Island. This will ensure prosecutions against the laws of Norfolk Island are dealt with by a professional and independent prosecution service with significant expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has considered this bill. The committee recommended further information be included in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, which the government has now tabled. Can I also thank the committee for their consideration of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has reviewed laws and court procedures on Norfolk Island. The measures in this bill will authorise the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island to sit on the Australian mainland in the exercise of its civil and criminal jurisdiction. It will allow for a matter to be heard and for a jury to be empanelled in another state or territory. There are risks with drawing juries from a population as small as Norfolk Island, and this measure will ensure trials can be conducted fairly, improving community confidence in the Norfolk Island justice system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further measures in the bill will remove the time limits that apply to the prosecution of historical sexual offences on Norfolk Island and remove any immunity for alleged offenders arising from these limits. Time limits on prosecuting sexual offences, including historical sexual offences, and the immunity that may arise are no longer in line with community standards. Similar amendments have been made in other jurisdictions, including Victoria, the ACT and South Australia. The bill confirms the general position under Norfolk Island law that a prosecution for a serious offence may be commenced at any time after the commission of the offence. These measures also implement for Norfolk Island a key recommendation of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which recommended time limits and remaining immunity from prosecution for historical child sexual abuse offences be removed. While the amendments are retrospective in their effect, they do not seek to revive those old sexual offences that do not create retrospective criminal offences. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has committed to modernising laws and providing services on Norfolk Island comparable to those in mainland jurisdictions. The measures in this bill will authorise the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island to sit on the Australian mainland in the exercise of its civil and criminal jurisdiction. It will allow for a matter to be heard and a jury to be empanelled in another state or territory. The measures are modelled on similar amendments made for Christmas Island in 1987. This measure will ensure trials can be conducted fairly, improving community confidence in the Norfolk Island justice system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further measures in this bill will remove the time limits that apply to prosecution of historical sexual offences on Norfolk Island and remove any immunity for legal offenders arising from these limits. In doing so, the bill is consistent with Commonwealth criminal law policy that a prosecution for a serious offence may be commenced at any time after the commission of that offence. Time limits on prosecuting sexual offences, including historical sexual offences, and the immunity that may arise is no longer in line with community standards. Similar amendments have been made in other jurisdictions, including Victoria, the ACT and South Australia. These measures also implement for Norfolk Island a key recommendation of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse which recommended time limits and remaining immunity from prosecution for historical child sexual abuse offences be removed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I rise to put Labor's position with regard to this bill on the record today in light of the deals that were done—that may or may not live long in the memory of Australians, as so many dirty deals have been done by this government. But, with regard to this particular one, the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund exists only because of a shoddy backroom deal between the Turnbull government and the Nick Xenophon political party, who now call themselves Centre Alliance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This fund is the result of a heavily compromised trade-off. The fund didn't come about because the Turnbull government genuinely committed to promoting public interest journalism. Far from it. It came about as a result of one of many backroom deals done to grease the path for the Turnbull government's repeal of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. This is a rule that, until September last year, acted as a public interest safeguard by stopping any one voice in the media landscape from becoming too dominant and by promoting diversity and competition between different voices. The two-out-of-three rule ensured that no individual or company controlled more than two out of three regulated media platforms—commercial television, commercial radio or associated newspapers—in the same licence area. In essence, it was to preserve diversity of opinion on our airwaves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a democratic country like Australia, which has one of the highest levels of media concentration in the world, you would think that removing such a significant safeguard would be understood as being seriously misguided. But not for this Turnbull government. You would think that senators from South Australia, a state one point above the minimum floor for the number of media voices, would comprehend the importance of maintaining a rule that serves media diversity. But, no, not for former Senator Xenophon and not for Centre Alliance. Last year the Turnbull government junked a safeguard that prevented Australia's already high levels of media concentration getting worse, and it did so with the help of Nick Xenophon and the Centre Alliance senators. What sad irony that a law that acted as a democratic safeguard in promoting media diversity was done away with by deal making conducted behind closed doors and away from democratic scrutiny. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, why all the deals? Well, after trying for over a year to get the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule through parliament, the Turnbull government was not able to persuade this chamber on absolute merit. You may ask why, and the answer is a very instructive revelation of this government's intention. The repeal of this rule was contrary to the public interest. They were unsuccessful in getting it through on merit, so they went to the deal making that characterised the final passage of this bill. Instead of accepting the reality of acting against the public interest, the Turnbull government started on a series of grubby backdoor deal-making adventures, including a grant of $30 million of taxpayer funds to Fox Sports. At Senate estimates in October last year, the Australian Sports Commission and the office for sport officials confirmed that they had not been asked to provide any advice in relation to this dubious deal. The Liberals would rather have Australians believe that this payment is about promoting women's sport. But the fact is this government didn't even consult their own sports advisers about whether or not it was a good idea before they just went ahead and did the deal anyway. Yet, even that grubby deal wasn't quite enough to get them over the line. Further deals were yet to be done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, the Turnbull government sidled up to Pauline Hanson and the Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, going so far as to use the ABC as a bargaining chip to ensure One Nation's support for these very flawed media ownership changes that their legislation proposes. Last year, the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> aired a program into One Nation called <span style="font-style:italic;">Please Explain</span> and ABC News published leaked recordings of conversations that Senator Hanson's use of a donated light aircraft featured in amongst other things. In response, Senator Hanson threatened to refuse to support the federal budget unless the ABC's funding was cut by $600 million over four years. This ridiculous retaliatory threat didn't hit its mark and $600 million didn't disappear, but that does not mean that the ABC has not been under attack constantly by this government, with Senator Hanson cheering from the sidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2017, the government announced a deal with the One Nation party on media ownership changes inclusive of a number of unnecessary and unwarranted amendments to the ABC Act and charter as well as an insidious competitive neutrality inquiry aimed at reducing the role of the ABC to that of a market failure broadcaster. In announcing the deal, Senator Hanson also made it clear that she'd be speaking to the Treasurer and going after the ABC in the budget in 2018. Fast forward to the budget last night and—lo and behold!—further savage cuts were handed down to the ABC. This budget of 2018 contains a further $127 million in cuts to the ABC over four years on top of the $254 million in cuts that the Liberals have imposed on the ABC since 2014. The Liberals have now broken their election promise, which you might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, of no cuts to the ABC. That was one of the things that was written in the blue blood of the other side. Well, they have broken that promise many, many times over. Part of breaking it was securing this dirty deal to get rid of the two-out-of-three rule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, the Liberals have frozen the indexation of ABC's operational funding, amounting to a cut of $83.7 million. They articulated that it's to ensure the ABC continues to find back-office efficiencies. But the government know they can't squeeze blood from a stone. They know full well that this cut that they are inflicting on the ABC means cuts to jobs, content and services at the ABC. The Liberals and Nationals complain that the ABC isn't doing enough news coverage, yet these hypocrites have left a $43 million hole in funding for ABC News and Current Affairs. The ABC said that the impact of the cuts cannot be absorbed by efficiency measures alone because the ABC has already achieved significant productivity gains in response to past budget cuts. The Liberals claim their budget is about investing to create more jobs every day and to support essential services, yet these cuts to the ABC will inevitably lead to job losses. Redundancies at the ABC are on the horizon as a result of the government's cuts to the ABC in last night's budget, and reductions in the ABC services that Australians value will be the consequence of the budget delivered by Scott Morrison, the Treasurer, last night. We will have less news and fewer jobs as a result of these attacks on the ABC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of all these deals, there are now three bills before the parliament to meddle in the ABC Act, to have a faux competitive neutrality inquiry and to have a further efficiency review to undermine the ABC. Yet, despite all of that, it still wasn't enough. To secure their legislation against the public interest, the government still needed the senators in the then Nick Xenophon Team—now called the Centre Alliance—to get them over the line. So off they went, money in hand, to do a deal. Nick Xenophon and his senators from South Australia knew that if he did a deal with the Turnbull government to scrap the two-out-of-three rule he would be responsible for handing unprecedented media power to the hands of a privileged few, despite the fact that Australia has one of the most concentrated media markets in the world. Yet Senator Xenophon—with the approval of his party, you'd have to suggest—did the deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's more, Senator Xenophon knew that, if he did the deal with the Turnbull government to scrap the two-out-of-three rule, he'd be responsible for the unleashing of an unprecedented attack on our very highly respected national broadcaster, the ABC, and also the SBS. Each member of the Xenophon team knew well that a vote for the government's media ownership changes was a vote for the competitive neutrality inquiry, which is designed to cruel the ABC and SBS, and that they were also signing off on a raft of other retaliatory attacks designed by the government, with Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, against the ABC. Yet, despite all of that, the Xenophon party did the deal. What's more, former Senator Xenophon knew that, if he did the deal with the Turnbull government to scrap the two-out-of-three rule, he wouldn't even get the kind of journalism fund that he wanted. He knew that the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund was compromised and that it excluded publishers like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> Australia. By his own admission, the deal was ideologically motivated and, therefore, fundamentally flawed as a public interest intervention. But—that's right—despite all that, Senator Xenophon went ahead with the deal. Just weeks after supporting the Turnbull government's flawed media ownership changes in exchange for a handful of beans, Nick Xenophon announced that he was leaving the Australian Senate and federal politics altogether, and his departure ensures that he will not be accountable for the consequences of the damage that he did when he signed up to that dirty deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's repeal of the two-out-of-three rule permits media mergers and further concentration of Australia's already highly concentrated media market, and it begs the question: why expend taxpayers' money on a fund for journalism cadetships and scholarships when there aren't enough jobs to go around for existing journalists? Where will the new journalism cadets work when the media mergers, consolidations and job losses that follow the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule occur? What we've seen since the repeal of that rule is absolutely alarming. In the media sector, we've seen yet more closures and job cuts. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Blacktown Sun</span>, for example, and its sister publications, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rouse Hill Courier</span>—trusted sources of local news and information—closed in December last year. Sadly, right on the heels of the closure of those local papers, the only dedicated national newspaper for young Australians, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crinkling News</span>, has also announced it will cease. This innovative outfit ticked so many of the boxes, informing the child audience, developing literacy skills and promoting critical media thinking, but it wasn't saved by anything that Senator Xenophon claimed he was hoping to achieve. The fact that these closures come after the Turnbull government's changes to media ownership laws were enacted in the announcement of this Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund shows how inappropriate these measures actually are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've learnt for decades that public interest journalism is under immense pressure from digital disruption, yet this government has cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the ABC and SBS, trusted sources of investigative journalism in Australia. It's repealed the two-out-of-three cross-media rule to permit even greater consolidation of Australia's already highly concentrated media sector and it's now threatening journalists with criminal sanctions simply for doing their jobs, with its flawed Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme. Clearly, the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund is a meagre short-term bandaid. It's too little and it's too late for too many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the six months that have passed since the Turnbull government abolished the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, in an orgy of deal-making and back-scratching, cross-media mergers have begun to result. How many have actually come through? The answer is zero. The milestone makes a mockery of communication minister Mitch Fifield's alarmist urgings that parliament must act on media reforms to protect Australian jobs and give industry a fighting chance and his dire predictions of the failure of Australian media organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At one point in his defence of his attack on the two-out-of-three rule, the minister said that Labor's opposition to the repeal was crippling the industry and limiting the options for organisations like Channel Ten. How wrong he was! Developments since that time clearly demonstrate just how captured by the sector the Turnbull government was and how out of touch it remains. The CBS acquisition of Channel Ten occurred thanks to the two-out-of-three rule. It was voted for overwhelmingly by Ten staff and has seen Ten go on a frenetic new hiring spree and commission the largest number of new domestic shows it has ever commissioned in one year. Contrary to Minister Fifield's doom and gloom, the President of CBS Studios International, Mr Nunez, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're looking to grow Ten, we're looking to evolve Ten, we're looking to see Ten be successful in every way possible …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By comparison, it's now well understood that the alternative plan for Ten, devised to follow the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule—which I'm glad to say was delayed long enough to allow Ten to be acquired more generously—was to slash its newsroom and bring in News Corp's Sky News to reduce costs and give the Murdoch news service greater reach. That did not happen, thankfully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the recent joint venture for playout operations between Seven West Media and Nine Entertainment indicates, with efficiencies we inevitably see job cuts. Labor acknowledges that other media merger plans may already be in train and may yet materialise. With recent history as our witness, Labor again condemns the Turnbull government's repeal of the two-out-of-three rule, which paves the way for further job losses and consolidation in Australia's media market, which is, as I've said, already one of the most concentrated in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this deal, the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, Senator Xenophon revealed the pitiful price he put on Australia's media diversity—$60.4 million in exchange for his vote to repeal the two-out-of-three rule. Labor won't oppose this bill, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017, but regards the fund to be a short-term, bandaid solution that does nothing to fill the void left by the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule. It's too little, too late for too many media organisations. The fact that innovative outfits like <span style="font-style:italic;">Crinkling News</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>have announced their closure since the changes to the media law and the announcement of the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund indicates how inadequate the Turnbull government's measures are. Labor senators further note that the fund exposes the rank hypocrisy of the government when it comes to the use of taxpayers' funds to prop up commercial media instead of supporting our national public broadcasters. The Turnbull government handed $30 million to Fox Sports, which has a foreign based parent company, but excluded <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> Australia from this fund for the same reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not oppose the bill, which amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, by inserting a new part 14F, to establish legislative authority for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to make a grant of financial assistance to a publisher of a newspaper, magazine or other periodical, or a content service provider. The grants would be limited to the financial year commencing 1 July 2018 and the following two financial years. Labor will not oppose a mechanism to distribute a modest, short-term fund in the name of public interest journalism. But Labor will hold the Turnbull government to account for undermining what precious little media diversity Australia enjoys. Taken together, the Turnbull government's media ownership changes and its plans to undermine our public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, represent a direct assault on media diversity in Australia. This has implications for our democracy and our culture. The Turnbull government seems hell-bent on destroying diversity in Australian broadcasting. Labor condemns the Turnbull government's disastrous record on media diversity and public interest journalism. To this end, I move the second reading amendment as circulated in my name:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  I rise today to speak in relation to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. I concur with many of the comments put forward by Senator O'Neill in relation to this bill, particularly when she spoke about the consistent attacks from the government on the Australian public broadcaster the ABC. And let's not forget their constant attacks on SBS as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that again last night. Despite all the promises when Tony Abbott was vying to be the Prime Minister back in 2013, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, and he said that there would be no cuts to the ABC, well, that was wrong. Over and over and over again what we have seen from the Liberal government are cuts to the ABC. Last night more cuts to the ABC were in the budget handed down by the Treasurer, Scott Morrison. This government really doesn't like public interest journalism, and the reason they don't like public interest journalism is because they don't like the scrutiny that comes with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us today relates directly to the deal that was done with former Senator Xenophon at the time of the passing of the two-out-of-three rule and the media reform package. It was a pretty dodgy deal at the end of the day. It was pretty measly in terms of the bang for its buck and, ultimately, what we saw was Senator Xenophon give cover to the government—to agree, with the insistence of One Nation and Pauline Hanson, that the ABC would continue to be a punching bag for their side of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation, of course, hate the ABC. They always have and always will. They can't stand that we would have well-trained, quality journalists asking tough questions. They can't stand it. Senator Pauline Hanson cannot stand the fact that there are ABC journalists in this place, up in the press gallery, who ask the tough questions. She'd prefer that no-one questioned what she stood for, her motives or why she says one thing in Queensland and does another thing in the chamber here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, when she's in Queensland, Senator Pauline Hanson, leader of One Nation, goes around telling everybody that One Nation cares about the battlers. But One Nation come down into this place and they vote with the government time and time and time again for tax cuts for the wealthy and tax cuts for big corporations. They're now asking the taxpayer to fund the compensation that the banks should pay as a result of the royal commission looking into people who have been screwed over by the banking industry. They want the taxpayer to fund the compensation. They want to give the banks a big tax cut and they want the taxpayer to foot the bill. It's just extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So of course Senator Pauline Hanson doesn't like the idea that the ABC and SBS have good quality journalists who ask the tough questions. One Nation want to see their funding cut and, of course, last night in the budget that's what we saw: funding cuts to the ABC—funding cuts to the ABC despite the promise from Malcolm Turnbull and, previously, from Tony Abbott that that would not happen. Well, you just can't take their word for anything any more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as part of the deal that was done with the Xenophon team, this bill puts aside money to help small publishers to ensure that there is some element of support for public interest journalism. But, of course, the government couldn't stand the idea that some other, smaller publishers and players in this space—people and journalists who offer good quality public interest journalism, such as journalists who write and report for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>—might be able to get some of this financial support. So this bill says that only some people—small country News-Limited-owned papers, for example—can access this fund; if you're a journalist doing good investigative work for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, you're not allowed to have any of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an ideological bill in the way that it has been drawn up. It's ridiculous that we're now seeing, even though Senator Xenophon isn't even in the chamber anymore—he's not a member of the federal parliament—that his legacy is a dodgy deal put on the table that allows for the government to follow through with their ideological attack on public interest journalism. Indeed, it gave cover to the government's continual attack on the ABC and One Nation's attack on the ABC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, at the time that this bill was being negotiated with former Senator Xenophon, former Senator Xenophon said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government's position was that the Guardian Australia's parent entity was foreign and therefore would not qualify. I do not believe this is relevant. What is relevant is that Australian news stories and analysis are being produced by Australian journalists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I fear that there was narrow, blinkered ideology at play on the part of some Coalition backbenchers and some crossbenchers… You have to ask whether blind ideology, yet again, got in the way of sensible public policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not very often that I agree with the words of the former Senator Nick Xenophon, but on this one I absolutely do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as Senator O'Neill has pointed out, despite all of that he still did the deal. So that is why we have this piece of legislation before us, which is an ideological bandaid from this government. It gives cover to the attack from One Nation on the ABC and it gives cover to the hatred of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> and the ABC by some coalition backbenchers, probably some of their frontbenchers too. We know what the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, thinks of the ABC and thinks of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>: he can't stand them. So they have now put in place a fund that is restricted, because of their own ideological blinkers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of government is not to just support your mates because your mates want you to; it's to do things in the interest of the whole country. It is not up to the government to decide that, because they don't like the ABC reporting on them or asking the tough questions, or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> doing good investigative work, they won't get funding. They will be thrown under the bus while the Murdoch press and News Limited can get a free ride. This is effectively a taxpayer handout to News Limited. That's what this bill allows for: a taxpayer handout to News Limited and the Murdoch press.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you walked down the street and you spoke to the average Australian and you said, 'The Australian public is going to restrict money going to foreign companies and foreign journalists', do you think they'd think that the Murdoch press were foreign or Australian owned? What do you think people on the street would say? I don't think anyone thinks Rupert Murdoch is Australian—not anymore. He's got no interest in looking after Australia; all he's interested in is continuing to build his big multimedia Murdoch empire. Meanwhile, just because journalists in this country—who are covering Australian stories, doing good investigative work and ensuring that as parliamentarians we do our job—happen to work for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, or some other media outlet, they're not entitled to the same support. That's what this bill does. It's simply extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be moving an amendment to this piece of legislation to try and rectify this problem and to remove the ideological blinkers that have been embedded in this piece of legislation as part of the dodgy deal with the Nick Xenophon Team in order to give cover to One Nation's attack on the ABC, SBS and, of course, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>. This amendment is important. It will remove the effect of the narrow, blinkered ideology that the former Senator Nick Xenophon referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember what this bill is meant to be about. It is meant to be about supporting Australian journalism. We want to support Australian journalism. The Labor Party wants to do that. We've heard from the government that they think they want to do that—I will take that with a grain of salt. The Greens want to do that. Obviously, some members of the crossbench want to do that. But, unlike the government, we don't just want to support the journalists that we agree with. We are simply saying that, if we're going to support journalism with Australian tax dollars, let's support Australian journalists writing Australian stories for Australian audiences. That should be the criteria if we care about investing, protecting, underpinning and supporting public interest journalism in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This should not be a controversial position. The Greens will move this amendment to remove this blinkered ideology that says that money can only go to the government's friends on its side of politics. The government has suggested that, if this amendment passes, it will not proceed with the bill. And here drops the penny: this government doesn't give two hoots about journalists' jobs in this country. This government doesn't give two hoots about whether small publishers are able to continue doing their good work, ensuring that they can report local stories for local audiences. This government would prefer, if <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> was included or if there was an element that allowed for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> to be included in this, no-one got any support at all. Malcolm Turnbull would rather have no money going to any news outlet than have a single dollar go to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>. That's the government's position in relation to the Greens fixing this bill to remove the blinkered ideology and to ensure that we support Australian journalism across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, of course, here in the Greens, take a more balanced approach. We say that it's not the job of the government to decide which side of the political media you want to support and which side you want to let hang out to dry. Our amendment, that will be moved in the committee stage, strips out the government's ideology test on who can and who can't have access to the funding model. This is public money. It's not the government's money, it's not Malcolm Turnbull's money, it's certainly not the backbenchers in the coalition's money and it's not Pauline Hanson's One Nation's money. This is Australian taxpayers' money. Every Australian has the right to know that their taxes are being spent fairly and outside of a politically ideological bent, and yet this government reveals itself over and over and over again as having no care for anyone else unless they're on its side of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about the tax cuts that were announced last night. The government don't care about the people at the bottom end, really. They want to go to a situation where we do away with a progressive tax system, because all they're interested in is looking after their rich mates. They don't care if people at the bottom end need public services, schools, hospitals and access to doctors, because their mates can afford to use the private system. Their mates can afford to go and spend their money where they want and get the services when they want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People at the lower end of the income brackets are doing it really tough, but this government doesn't give a damn. It's blinded by its ideology. Whether it's media reform, whether it's tax reform or whether it's anything else that comes before this place, this government overplays its hand every time and unveils its grotesque political ideology for all to see. This bill is a blatant misuse of public money, and an abuse of public trust for Malcolm Turnbull and Mitch Fifield to decide which—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator Hanson-Young, I remind you to refer to senators and those in the other place by their correct titles.</span>

                    </a>  I appreciate that. This is a blatant misuse of public money and an abuse of the public trust for the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the Minister for Communications, Mitch Fifield, to decide which journalists they support based on which journalists support them. That is the crux of the issue here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want to support Australian journalism and journalists' jobs. At a time when trust in politics is so low, public interest journalism is more important than ever. The public funding to support public interest journalism must be available to all players, not just those in the right-wing media and their friends in the government. This is about ensuring that we support Australian journalism and Australian journalists, not just the ones that happen to agree with the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want a strong, sustainable and vibrant news media industry, and we want a balanced one. We're not suggesting for a moment that all of the funding should just go to news outlets that promote the Greens' policies. That wouldn't be investment in public interest journalism because, in order to have proper public interest journalism, there must be balanced representation and reporting so people on all sides can get all the different views. So whether you are a Greens member of parliament, a Liberal member of parliament, a One Nation member of parliament or a Nick Xenophon member of parliament—whatever you are—you should know that when a journalist is reporting they are doing it because they are supporting and upholding public interest journalism. It doesn't matter whether or not they like our views. In turn, it shouldn't matter whether or not we like their reporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government says it would rather go broke than stay balanced. This amendment is an opportunity to say to the government that it has overreached and, well and truly, this is the case. It is an opportunity for the Centre Alliance, Senator Griff and Senator Patrick, to correct what former senator Nick Xenophon said was an instance where 'blind ideology yet again got in the way of sensible public policy'. I say this to Senator Griff and Senator Patrick: Nick's gone; he's nicked off. You have an opportunity today to fix this mistake, to make sure we remove the blind ideology. Why should taxpayers fund just one reported view of how this government is going? Why should taxpayers fund the mouthpiece of One Nation and Senator Pauline Hanson but no other journalist in this country? It is an ideologically blind piece of legislation. We can fix it. We can fix it today, and I urge you to consider the amendments at the committee stage.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I feel compelled to make a contribution to the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017, because of the importance of public interest journalism. This is an issue with which I've had some involvement as the chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism and, as chair, I put a significant amount of work into preparing the committee's final report which I tabled in the Senate in February this year. Through the 75 written submissions that were received by the committee and the seven public hearings that were held, the committee learned that public interest journalism in Australia is in crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accurate, quality in-depth investigative journalism is under threat from digital disruption and the news media faces significant challenges in the transition to online news delivery. The revenue of traditional media outlets has crashed, and this has led to the shutting down and restructuring of many media outlets. Despite overall growth in advertising revenue between 2013 and 2017, digital advertising is growing rapidly and sucking up revenue that used to go to traditional media. According to standard media index figures, the total advertising spend in Australia over this period increased by 11 per cent. However, digital advertising experienced an 87 per cent increase compared to a slight decline, about five per cent, in television advertising. Print advertising, however, has suffered a sharp decline, with advertising revenues in newspapers and magazines falling a massive 46 per cent. Newspapers are struggling to arrest this decline and make up revenue through subscriptions. This loss of revenue has translated to the loss of around 3,000 journalism positions in the last five years or roughly a quarter of the journalism positions in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been two perverse outcomes from the decline of newspaper revenues. The first is the pressure on maintaining journalistic values as newspapers fight to claw back their declining market share. Newspapers are now more averse to upsetting their advertisers and, in an effort to sell more papers, some are substituting stories that are in the public interest for entertainment and sensationalism. The second outcome is the loss of investment in quality journalism itself. Having to produce more column inches in a shorter period of time means that journalists have fewer resources for in-depth stories, the kind of stories that really hold our powerful public and private institutions to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of negative effects of the disruption to the traditional media business model were explored through the future of public interest journalism inquiry. For example, there was evidence given by Deakin University that rural and regional areas had fewer reliable sources of local news, particularly when the news was produced hundreds of kilometres away from the towns to which they were broadcast. Evidence was also given about the decline in reporting on public health issues, a function which in the past has led to scrutiny of the effects of dangerous substances such as tobacco and asbestos. And contributors to the inquiry talked about the decline in services aimed at broadcasting to and promoting the interests of minority groups such as Indigenous Australians and Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A great deal of evidence was received by the inquiry regarding the overall decline in quality of news leading the public to lose trust in journalists and mainstream media. This problem is exacerbated by the modern media's 24-hour news cycle, which is placing pressure on journalists and publishers to break stories early with little time to check the accuracy of their facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public-interest journalism serves an important democratic function, and a great example of how the crisis in public-interest journalism has threatened democracy was given to the inquiry by the editor of The Conversation, Misha Ketchell, who told one of the inquiry's public hearings:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My view is that the role of journalists for a long period of time, before this digital disruption we're talking about, was being almost a cop on the beat in the public sphere—'This information is unreliable and shouldn't be published; this information is reliable and should be published.' Part of what's happened with the collapse of the business models is there's no-one to pay the cop on the beat anymore. That role has been diminished, and what you have instead is a free-for-all of hyperpartisan debate, where everybody says everybody's lying, everybody can accuse everybody of fake news, and it's hard to know what you can trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when public interest journalism is in crisis, it's not just the media industry but also our democracy that's under threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The crisis in public interest journalism has been unfolding for quite some time now. It was unfolding while Labor was in government, and that's why we initiated the Convergence review and the Finkelstein inquiry. It has continued to unfold under the Abbott and Turnbull Liberal governments, yet those opposite haven't lifted a finger to tackle the crisis. Not only have those opposite been negligent in confronting this crisis; they've actually made it worse. A key plank in the government's assault on public interest journalism has been their savage cuts to the ABC and the SBS. The impact of the cuts to the ABC were outlined in detail by the journalists union, the Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance, in their submission to the inquiry. The MEAA's submission said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Constant cuts are also negatively affecting the ABC's ability to fund public interest journalism and local newsrooms. Budget cuts in 2014 saw the elimination of the local Friday edition <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> program (formerly called <span style="font-style:italic;">Stateline</span>) from eight states and territories, diminishing the in<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Cambria Math;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‐</span>depth coverage of state politics, health, education and environmental issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Deep cuts to reporting staff, field crews, travel budgets and other current affairs programs have also occurred across capital city newsrooms over the last three years. This month the state issues TV program <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia Wide</span>, has been eliminated, and plans to downsize influential radio shows <span style="font-style:italic;">AM</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">PM</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Today</span> look likely. International bureaus have also been downscaled over the last decade following the cancellation of Australia Network – with many overseas bureaus manned by single<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Cambria Math;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‐</span>person video<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Cambria Math;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‐</span>journalists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key plank in the Turnbull government's attack on public interest journalism has been their repeal of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, a move which threatens the diversity of voices in Australia's media landscape. I will come back to this issue in more detail a bit later on in my contribution, but before that I want to turn to the provisions of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill sets up the regional and small publishers innovation fund, a $50 million fund delivered over the next three years which will help regional and small publishers and other entities to transition, compete and innovate more successfully in a changing media environment. The fund is specifically aimed at promoting civic journalism in Australia, and the purpose of civic journalism is to investigate and explain public policies and issues of public interest or significance. It aims to engage citizens in public debate and inform democratic decision-making. If passed, this bill would amend the Broadcasting Services Act to give the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, the authority to disburse grants from the fund. Some of the activities that could be eligible for grant funding include things such as the purchase of a particular piece of technology or equipment, supporting a program or initiative that is intended to promote civic journalism, the development of an application for the delivery of news and other media related content services, training and upskilling of staff, and efforts to increase revenue and readership. The bill would also allow the Minister for Communications to establish an advisory committee to provide advice to the ACMA on the disbursement of these grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill goes some small way in addressing the crisis in public interest journalism and, as such, Labor will not oppose it. Unfortunately, though, it's come too late for innovative publications such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Crinkling News</span>, which was Australia's only newspaper dedicated to news for children. It sadly announced its closure shortly before I presented the report of the inquiry on the future of public interest journalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor is supporting this legislation, let's recognise why the Turnbull government are pursuing it. Is it because they're concerned about the crisis in public interest journalism? I don't think so. Is it because they want to support innovation in small and regional publications? I doubt it's that either. The only reason the government are pursuing this bill is because of a deal they've stitched up with former senator Nick Xenophon in exchange for his party's support for the repeal of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. If the then Nick Xenophon Team, now the Centre Alliance, were trying to address the crisis in public interest journalism, they failed dismally with this deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you the reasons I think it's such a big deal: firstly, the fund is temporary, whereas the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule is permanent. Secondly, whatever small benefits arise from the establishment of this fund will be far outweighed by the devastating impact the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule will have on public interest journalism. Until the Turnbull government repealed the two-out-of-three rule last year, it served as an important tool for maintaining a diversity of voices in Australia's media landscape. The rule provided that no person or company could control more than two out of three media platforms—commercial radio, commercial TV and newspaper—in the same radio licence area. The government has managed to enact this repeal at a time when Australia already has one of the most concentrated media markets in the developed world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rise in online media I referred to earlier was the government's justification for pursuing this misguided obsession. However, as I said in my speech on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform Bill) 2016 last year, there is still a large number of Australians who rely on those traditional forms of media for their news and current affairs. We know, for example, that over half of Australian media consumers get their news from television, radio and newspapers. That figure is even higher in the older age cohorts. So, contrary to what those  advocating the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule will tell you, digital disruption is not necessarily leading to a diversity of voices in the media landscape. In fact, the majority of the most popular news websites accessed by Australians are directly or jointly owned by traditional media platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The repeal of this rule is a threat to informed democratic debate, as it allows a single person or organisation to control how local news is reported. This potentially gives one person a lot of power in a market where big media players are already wielding a great deal of power. When the government tried previously to repeal the two-out-of-three rule in a 2016 bill, that bill was referred to an inquiry. Labor's dissenting report quoted eminent academics who argued for the retention of the two-out-of-three rule. While I used these quotes in my speech on the government's 2016 bill, I think a couple of them are worth repeating. Professor Michael Fraser from the University of Technology, Sydney said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is notorious, in terms of news and current affairs, that we, among the democracies, have the least diversity in our newspapers and have very little in television.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Rodney Tiffen from the University of Sydney said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Media concentration in Australia is amongst the highest in the world. Our daily press is the most concentrated in the world … Our pay TV industry is the most concentrated in the world …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to give those couple of examples of how concentrated Australia's media market really is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Finkelstein inquiry, which was conducted under the former Labor government, observed that Australia was the only country in the world where the leading newspaper companies account for more than half of daily circulation. Australia's top two newspaper companies combined have an 86 per cent share of the newspaper market. The government's own department of communications pointed out in its submission to the inquiry into the government's 2016 broadcasting bill that the internet has given existing media companies a vehicle to increase their influence. A situation where standards of journalism are declining but the big media companies are extending their influence is a dangerous combination that does not augur well for Australian democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance, former Senator Xenophon's team, have basically sold the farm and they've got a few peanuts in return—the fund established with the bill will not even come close to making up for the media diversity safeguards that have been traded away. I've mentioned two reasons why Central Alliance's deal was such a dud deal for the Australian public, but there is a third reason: the many flaws in the design of this fund. It's not just the fact that the government has only committed to the fund for three years but also that the fund is so limited in its scope. The government has excluded a range of publishers, including those with foreign based parent companies, and, funnily enough, those affiliated with a superannuation fund. So it seems somewhat hypocritical to exclude innovative publishers like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, which has a foreign based parent company, when the same publishers can access the government's proposed journalism cadetship and scholarship program. It's especially hypocritical considering this government gave a massive $30 million to Fox Sports to cover underrepresented sports. I'm a strong believer in training and skills development, but I have to ask: what's the point of cadetship and scholarship programs in a declining market for journalism jobs; and does the industry need to train more journalists when there are not enough jobs for existing journalists? They are just a couple of questions thrown out there. And that situation, by the way, is no doubt going to get worse with the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I say this is an awful deal for the Australian public, I think that is true of any deal that involves agreeing to the government's repeal of the two-out-of-three rule. There is very little that the government can offer in return that would undo the enormous damage that this repeal would cause to media diversity in Australia. Having said that, Central Alliance really was sold a pup, considering how little they extracted in exchange for supporting the government's ideological push for further media concentration. Public interest journalism needs more than this paltry side deal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate's <span style="font-style:italic;">Future of public interest journalism</span> report contains a number of useful recommendations, such as the recommendation relating to tax-deductible contributions to not-for-profit publications that subscribe to standards of public interest journalism, or the recommendation about reviewing the laws affecting the work of journalists who report on issues relating to border protection and national security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What would also be of great help, particularly for rural and regional areas, would be lobbying for decent broadband so that publishers and broadcasters can compete effectively in the digital age. Unfortunately, the deal with Central Alliance was not the only dirty deal the government did to secure support for its broadcasting bill last year. Even worse than their deal with Central Alliance was their deal with One Nation to change the ABC charter, a deal which is clearly aimed at undermining the integrity of the ABC. As one of One Nation's senators has admitted publicly, this deal is absolutely aimed at giving a platform for fringe groupers such as anti-vaxxers. The ABC is an important contributor to quality current affairs coverage in Australia, and this grubby deal between the Turnbull government and One Nation simply serves to further undermine public interest journalism in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning of my contribution on this bill, public interest journalism is a key pillar in a healthy democracy. While this bill on its own appears to be a good initiative, when we look back in the years to come at the broadcasting bill and the grubby deals that were made to pass it we will see it as a dark chapter in Australia's history. The Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund will be a distant memory that barely caused a blip on the radar of Australia's media landscape. At the same time, we could have an ABC that is forced by its charter to give as much weight to radical fringe groups as it does to detailed analysis and informed opinion, stymieing its ability to contribute to constructive public debate. In return, our media market, which is one of the most concentrated in the world, will become even more concentrated and the Turnbull government's continued failure to address the crisis in public interest journalism will mean that we have a media reduced to delivering entertainment and sensationalism, and that barely has the resources to invest in proper investigative journalism and to hold powerful interests to account. Labor will not oppose this bill, but we maintain that it does precious little to fill the void left by the repeal of the two-out-of-three-cross-media control rule.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  Centre Alliance supports the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017 and welcomes the establishment of the innovation fund to provide $50 million in grants to regional and small publishers. I pause here to emphasise that this bill forms just one part of a broader $60 million jobs and innovation package negotiated by us, with each measure designed to support the future of public interest journalism. In addition to the innovation fund we have secured 60 scholarships, valued at the $40,000 each, to enable regional journalism students to undertake journalism training. We've also secured funding for 200 cadetships over two years through the Regional and Small Publishers Cadetship Program, and I note that between 80 and 90 places will be reserved for regional publishers each year. Each measure is designed to support development, growth and continued innovation in Australian civic journalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consideration of this bill is timely, given that last week we celebrated the 25th anniversary of World Press Freedom Day—a day to reflect upon the role journalism plays in ensuring the transparency of the political process and the accountability of state institutions towards the public. But while this role of accountability is not new, today's journalists and publishers must adapt to the changing media landscape. It was in March 2018 that the final report of the Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism highlighted the difficulties faced by the media in light of the rapid pace and scale of new forms of delivery and technology platforms being developed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence revealed that many traditional media print companies, even some of our largest and longest-running media organisations, have struggled to adapt to these changes and were yet to develop sustainable business models. These difficulties are further compounded for small and regional publishers. Regional publishers provide vital news coverage to communities scattered across vast areas, all without the established infrastructure of their metropolitan peers. Small publishers, on the other hand, pursue stories that for a variety of reasons may not appeal to the established media players, all while operating with very minimal staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Journalists, editors, photographers and others at small regional publishers are undoubtedly a determined and resilient group. They have demonstrated time and time again that their work makes a meaningful contribution to public debate on both the local and national levels. Yet we know that without support this valuable voice could be lost, and that the communities these publishers serve will be very much the lesser for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The innovation fund provides an opportunity for publishers to reflect upon their needs and to improve the sustainability of their organisation. It will enable small and regional publishers to apply for a grant for funding. This may include the purchase of a particular piece of technology or equipment; funding a program or an initiative that is intended to promote civic journalism; developing an application for the delivery of news; or training and upskilling staff. The list of possible approved funding projects is deliberately broad to enable ACMA and the publisher to work together to craft a funding agreement tailored to the unique requirements of each publisher and the community that they serve. Publishers will need to meet a primary purpose test whereby ACMA is satisfied that the publisher produces civic and public interest journalism with an Australian perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pause here and discuss the notion of public interest journalism for a moment. While the report of the Senate select committee noted the wide range of activities that public interest journalism encompasses, it can be, in my view, narrowed down to a handful of key principles: integrity, accountability, quality and independence. Journalism of this nature aims to provide the public with a considered analysis and to ensure that all citizens are provided with the opportunity to make informed decisions on current political, economic and social issues. Research has shown that this is particularly true of regional and small publishers, where the close links between the publisher and the community lead to deliberations and discussions, which in turn encourage civic participation. These publishers have the ability to empower and improve their communities, and there should be no doubt that these organisations are worthy of this investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to the grant criteria, additional criteria include: an annual turnover threshold of not less than $300,000 and not more than $30 million; an Australian residence test; an independence test; a control test; being a member of the Australian Press Council or having a robust and transparent complaints process; and having in place editorial guidelines and a code of conduct or similar framework relating to the provision of quality journalism. While the grant criteria are not included in the legislation, we do not view this as a barrier to the bill being passed. The grant criteria as set out in the explanatory memorandum have been publicly available since late last year, with a comprehensive information sheet made available on the Department of Communications and the Arts website.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill empowers the minister to constitute an advisory committee for the purpose of assisting the ACMA in the allocation and assessment of grants. The minister has already indicated to Centre Alliance that the terms of the agreement reached will be honoured, including the establishment of the foreshadowed advisory committee. The memorandum notes that it is expected the committee is to comprise at a minimum a representative appointed from each of the Australian Press Council, the Walkley Foundation and Country Press Australia. I note the comments of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report and acknowledge the wealth of experience these organisations have in relation to news, journalism and other media-related content and their willingness to assist the ACMA in assessing the merits of any application for funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are confident that the government will honour the broader policy behind the agreement, we put the government on notice that the allocation of funds and the application of the criteria will be closely monitored by Centre Alliance. The ACMA's annual reports will be carefully scrutinised and we will fully utilise the Senate estimates process to ensure the funds are being applied in a manner consistent with the eligibility criteria negotiated and agreed to by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to make clear that this bill is not a comment on the role of public broadcasters. Centre Alliance does and will continue to support an appropriately funded ABC and SBS. There can be no doubt on this issue. I also put the government on notice that we will not at all support effective cuts to the ABC, as proposed in the budget last night. We will not support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do recognise the challenges faced by small and regional publishers in a changing media environment. The policy intent behind the innovation fund is to ensure the longevity of these publishers through funding measures targeted to develop sustainable business models. The report of the Senate Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism acknowledged that government investment in public interest journalism is clearly a worthwhile one. In a submission to the select committee, Dr Bill Birnbauer of Monash University noted that a Harvard University study found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… for every $1 spent on a specified investigative story, $287 in policy benefits resulted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a staggering return on investment. The innovation fund does represent a significant investment in public interest journalism in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the fund is just one aspect of a $60 million package negotiated by us, with both the cadetship and scholarship programs supporting the next generation of journalists. As Walkley Award-winning journalist and academic Margaret Simons said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If experienced journalists are to be employed, to find things out, if journalists are to be developed and trained, if institutional cultures are to be built to support them in their dirty, vital work, then there must be money …</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I rise to speak on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. Let me say from the outset that I support this bill but do so rather cautiously. We all know that this bill has arisen as a result of a deal between the then Nick Xenophon Team and the government to repeal the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. Furthermore, the only reason this program is before the Senate is because of that deal, together with the agreement of One Nation to repeal media diversity safeguards to mount an attack on the ABC and SBS. Media diversity safeguards should not have been traded away so easily in exchange for local content. It is not an either/or proposition. Australia needs both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is bittersweet. It does contain some measures which, hopefully, will contribute positively to the expansion and contribution of additional local news content. However, it is already too little, too late. The availability of media services in the Northern Territory is already in decline. Last year, Channel 9 Darwin was forced to lay off roughly a dozen staff, and the ABC has discontinued its shortwave services in the remote regions of the Northern Territory and in northern Australia. Furthermore, in last night's budget it was revealed that the government is going to cut ABC funding by $127 million. On the eve of the 2013 election, the coalition promised there would be no cuts to the ABC, yet on top of the $254 million in cuts the government has imposed since 2014, this budget contains a further $127 million in cuts. It is absolutely disgraceful. The financial grants made available to news outlets over the next three years total just over $50 million, but I do have some concerns as to whether this money will actually be spent, because this government does not have a great track record on living up to its promises. It's taken them eight months to answer a question on notice on underspending in the Bridges Renewal Program from the estimates before last—and we're still waiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate that the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund exists only because of backroom deals, not because the Turnbull government is committed to public interest journalism. Where was the government when local news crews were being laid off? It was silent. Where was the government when the ABC was forced to cut its shortwave radio broadcasts? It was complicit. It is more interested in giving Foxtel—a foreign-owned company—a $30 million handout than it is in supporting public interest journalism, let alone regional journalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before entering politics, I was previously a journalist in the Northern Territory and New South Wales, and I worked as a regional reporter. Let me tell you, working as a regional journalist is no easy job. You certainly don't get to front the doors of the Senate at 7.45 am to get a couple of grabs before filing a story. As journalists in our regions across Australia, you are out there driving long distances, travelling long hours, to talk to people to get the stories that you need to cover to fill your paper, to fill the internet in terms of coverage on the net and certainly for coverage for television camera crews and radio broadcast services. You write, record, read and produce your own stories. It's great work, but it needs to be thoroughly supported and respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has the potential to promote public interest journalism, and I will be watching and pushing for that to happen. In particular, it has the potential to support regional cadetships, and it is good to hear from previous speakers in relation to those cadetships. The stated intention of the grants scheme is to assist regional and small publishers and other entities to transition and compete more successfully in a changing media environment. Examples of activities that could be eligible for grant funding include the purchase of a particular piece of technology or equipment, supporting a program or an initiative that is intended to promote civic journalism, the development of an application for the delivery of news and other media-related content services, training and upskilling of staff, and efforts to increase revenue and readership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do note that, for some reason, there are certain media organisations that have been prevented from applying for these grants: namely, BuzzFeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Daily</span>—all reputable online media organisations that could easily set up mobile offices in regional areas. The government has said it's because they're foreign-owned, which is a bit of a slap in the face because, as I said earlier, the government had no problem in gifting Foxtel a free $30 million cheque. I'm certainly interested to see how far this money goes; after all, the program will only run for three years. I'm also interested to see exactly which organisations will receive the grant funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has shown its incompetence at the highest levels. And it will probably approve funding for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Betoota Advocate</span> to fire up their printers in western Queensland. Have a think about that one. It's interesting to see that other large companies like News Corp Australia and Fairfax can access $10.4 million set aside for scholarships and cadetships yet, as I mentioned earlier, some of our nation's newest and most innovative news organisations are being excluded. Where will all the new journalism cadets work when the media merges, with the consolidations and job losses that will follow the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the fund runs out in nearly three years, which may well be before regional Australia actually comes to enjoy the reliable and affordable broadband services that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull promised would be delivered by now. Do regional media companies have the reliable and affordable broadband they need to enable them to grow their business and create more jobs in the digital age? I question it. What regional Australia needs for innovation is broadband that works, not just a bit of equipment and a few cadetships. Labor will hold the Turnbull government to account for stuffing up the NBN, for attacking the ABC and SBS and for destroying what precious little media diversity is left in this country—one of the most highly concentrated media markets in the world. And we'll be watching—I'll be watching—to see if the government keeps its word.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. I was a member of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee during its inquiry into this matter. We know that the bill would amend the Broadcasting Services Act of 1992 to establish the legislative framework for a regional and small publishers innovation fund, called the Innovation Fund. We know that the proposal from the government was designed as a grants funding scheme to be administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, and the purpose of that fund was to enable the ACMA, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to make a grant of financial assistance for the publisher of a newspaper, magazine, other periodical or to a content service provider. I think there were about nine or 10 submissions to this inquiry, if I recollect correctly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of writing the report, the Labor senators added additional comments. One of the things that we talked about, particularly in those additional comments, was the Turnbull government—but also the Abbott government—basically being asleep at the wheel for many years prior to addressing the crisis that was facing public interest journalism in Australia. That was highlighted through the representations and witnesses during the committee inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also acknowledge that it was Labor that established the Convergence Review and the Finkelstein inquiry, both of which have been comprehensively ignored by the Turnbull government. It was also Labor who established the Senate Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism with the support of the crossbenchers. So it was the activities of Labor that, in a lot of respects, initiated looking into the issues facing public interest journalism in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor senators noted that the Liberal-National government has cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the ABC and SBS. In the budget yesterday we saw the freeze on the ABC, which will impact their ability to progress some of their opportunities—just through mindless cuts by this government. The ABC and SBS both provide, I think, trusted investigative journalism in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also repealed the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, and that also provides greater opportunity to consolidate Australia's already highly concentrated media sector. It has gone so far as to threaten journalists with criminal sanctions simply for doing their jobs, and that was in conjunction with the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017—the FITS Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the Liberal-National government is continually taking money away from organisations, such as the ABC and SBS, that do have good investigative journalism is outrageous. At the time of writing the report, it looked like the Turnbull government was backing down on that bill. Again, a lot of that was because of the opposition from Labor and the media sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also noted that the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund existed only because of the backroom deal between the Turnbull government and the crossbench in exchange for the support of the repeal of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. Rather than the Turnbull government being anywhere near interested in, and genuinely committed to, promoting public interest in journalism—they're not interested in that—they're interested in doing a deal to progress and help their mates in the media, the big businesses of this country, and not provide good investigative journalism for the public of Australia to read or listen to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the two-out-of-three rule was directed at ensuring that no individual or company controlled more than two-out-of-three regulated media platforms—commercial television, commercial radio and associated newspapers—in the same licence area. It stopped any one voice from becoming too dominant and promoted diversity through competition between different voices—that was what that was about. The Turnbull government did a dirty deal with the crossbenchers to get that through—shove it through—at the expense of what I would say is creative investigative journalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's level of media ownership concentration is one of the highest in the world. Yet, again, the Turnbull government junked a safeguard that prevented it from getting worse. Again, they did that deal, on the two-out-of-three rule, with their mates on the crossbench to push it through, which impacted on the ability of people to have access to good investigative journalism. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  One of the highlights of the budget last night—and there were so many, and that's why it's received such wonderful acclaim—was the five things that the Turnbull government wanted to do to further strengthen our economy and guarantee the essentials that Australians rely upon. And one of those—No. 4—was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… keep Australians safe, with new investments to secure our borders and, as always …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Australia are very keen to secure our borders, and our government has done a very successful and effective job at that. That's what I want to talk about today because I chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and, in that capacity, we deal with estimates of the migration department, the Border Force and Operation Sovereign Borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last two or three years that committee has had numerous Senate inquiries relating to Manus Island and Nauru. At all of the inquiries, we've had the same sorts of witnesses advocating for the inmates of Manus and Nauru, telling the department what terrible people they were, what terrible people the service providers on the islands were, how they were all bad and the inmates were all perfect human beings and how terrible Australia had been. It's always been interesting in those committees that Senator McKim and, before that, Senator Hanson-Young would always take the side of the advocates and would always be raising these horror stories about how the inmates were treated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just on the weekend I was at a function where a guy by the name of Michael Coates spoke about a book he'd just written called <span style="font-style:italic;">Manus Days: The Untold Story of Manus Island</span>. I bought two copies and I've almost finished reading it. It is a fascinating account from someone who worked on Manus Island who didn't have any agenda to run. He was not involved in politics. He, like everyone else, thought all politicians were mad or bad. He had no personal agenda at all, but he's told the story about the truth of what happened on Manus Island. I think it is worth highlighting this because even now there are a lot of well-meaning people within Australia who continue to be fooled, to be hoaxed, by some of these detainees who are desperate to get to Australia even though they have been told that there's no chance that will happen. And they keep making up stories, they keep harming themselves, they keep doing things to let these well-meaning advocates in Australia take up their cause in this chamber, in Senate committees and in the media. They of course have a willing listener in the ABC and some of the other media, but I would urge all of those who want the real story to have a look at this particular account from a guy who does not have an agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I read you just a couple of excerpts from this book? This guy was a guard up there. He tells the story of one Iranian—apparently it was the Iranians that were the problem; the Rohingyas and the Afghans were respectful people who did what they were told and wanted to go home, most of them. The Iranians were always saying, 'Oh, we're persecuted—we can't go home.' But there's a story in there about an Iranian who confessed he was trying to get into Australia because he had killed someone and, even though his father was an important person in the Iranian civil service with a lot of influence, his father couldn't help him and didn't want to help him. So he thought, 'Well, I'll go to Australia.' He flew over, paid the people smuggler, got caught and ended up on Manus Island. As this book relates, a lot of these people are fleeing not from persecution but from prosecution by the authorities in their own countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The author was talking to some Iranians and he asked them, 'Do you think it's fair that you are here on Manus?' The Iranians all declared no emphatically. He asked, 'What would happen to me, though, if I tried to enter Iran illegally?' They said, 'You would be shot on sight or hanged as a spy.' He asked, 'They why did you think it would be any easier to enter Australia in this way?' They replied that most of them already had friends and family in Australia who had entered in this way. They knew that they would be caught and spend some time in detention but would eventually be allowed in. But, after 19 July, that all changed. In talking to some of the local PNG people, one of the PNG locals said this about the Iranians:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They are rude! They call us animals, they mock our country … They yell 'F..k Australia' …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They said: 'They get everything given to them—free food and free cigarettes. They don't have to work for anything, but they complain all the time.' Similar sentiments were voiced by others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This book is a fascinating read for anyone who wants to understand the real truth of what has happened and is happening on Manus Island. There were a lot of incidents where the Iranians, particularly, would go out of their way to bully everyone who wasn't Iranian in the camps and to cause trouble. There was an internet connection which everyone could have an hour on every day so that everyone could have a turn, but the Iranians would get onto the computer and not leave. The guards would say, 'Come on, mate—all your friends behind you want to get on to get in touch with their families.' The Iranians would say, 'No, no, no.' The guards tried to talk to them and tried to get them to move. A guard once bumped one of these guys at the computer and the guy said: 'You've just assaulted me. I'm going to complain. I'm going to go and cause a demonstration. We're going to riot over this. You've assaulted me.' He was barely bumped—there was no assault at all. This book has a very detailed, very factual, down-to-earth account of the real life on Manus Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I want to be kind to Senator Nick McKim, who's been one of the greatest advocates for these thugs who use every subterfuge to try to break the rules and get into Australia. I don't think Senator McKim's an evil person. I think he was fooled by these advocates who are paid to disseminate these lies and mistruths about what happens on Manus Island. As I say, I don't think Senator McKim is inherently evil; I think he's just been fooled by these advocates. He's been subjected to the stories that these people make up to get a headline on the ABC or to allow Senator McKim and Senator Hanson-Young to make some impassioned pleas in this chamber. But it is all on the basis of false information. So I thought, 'I'll do the right thing by Senator McKim—I will actually buy him a copy of this book.' I'll get the attendant to take it over to him. I got the author to sign it. He wrote, 'To Nick—enjoy,' and he signed it. I certainly hope Senator McKim and his colleagues in the Greens will actually read it and see what the real story was and see how they had been hoodwinked, see how they had been fooled and see how they had been the subject of hoaxers simply trying to get into Australia when they knew they had no chance of getting here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is very generous. We take genuine refugees. We are one of the most genuine and generous countries in the world so far as refugees are concerned. But people like Senator McKim have been hoaxed by these imposters. I just hope that on reading this Senator McKim will understand the real truth about Manus Island. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I'm deeply concerned about the Turnbull government's plans to privatise visa services functions in the Department of Home Affairs. This amounts to the outsourcing of more than 3,000 Public Service jobs across Australia, including more than 100—maybe 136—in Tasmania. Of course, when one job is lost, it doesn't just affect that person but their family as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor members and senators from Tasmania have written to the Prime Minister to express our concerns about this decision, and the overall decline in jobs in the Australian Public Service in Tasmania. Since the Liberals came to power in 2013, there has been the loss of more than 700 APS jobs in Tasmania, including 400 jobs in 2017 alone, reducing the APS in Tasmania by almost a quarter. These jobs are being lost not just in Hobart but right across the state, including in Launceston and on the north-west coast, where my colleague here, Senator Urquhart, is based.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These job losses come at a critical time for Tasmania, where full-time employment has fallen by 1,500 people since June last year. I've met with some of the workers concerned about the potential loss of their jobs due to the latest privatisation thought bubble, and a number of others have written to me. These are assessment services that will go out to tender in July 2018, with a range of other visa processing and client service functions to go to tender in July 2020. The department is also assessing bids for the co-design of an ICT platform for client services, data collection and simple assessment functions, with the first new visa product using this platform expected to be delivered in December next year. So there are reports that the department is inviting companies to help it design a new visa system which uses artificial intelligence to increase the number of visa applications processed automatically from less than 50 per cent today to more than 90 per cent. This raises the very real prospect of a repeat of the Centrelink robodebt debacle, but this time with visa processing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to outsource visa processing is straight from the Abbott government's Commission of Audit, which called for:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the development of a business case and scoping study for the outsourcing of visa processing functions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission suggested that call centres, shopfronts, counter services, data entry, payment collection, design and operation of websites and the processing of low- and medium-risk visa applications could all be outsourced. When I asked in Senate estimates why the decision to outsource was made, the department said that there was an element of budget savings, but that they were also aiming to improve client services. Well, it's pretty unclear to me how they intend to improve client services through this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this issue is about more than just job security or the size of the public service in Tasmania. There are many, many highly skilled, experienced staff in visa services who are able to provide wide-ranging advice on different visa subclasses and citizenship inquiries, and these staff also have access to highly sensitive data, not only on millions of Australians, including when and where they've travelled, but also on visa applicants, including the results of visa health checks. Given the large-scale data breaches we've seen in the private sector over the years, can we really trust that this data will be secure in the hands of a private company? Why should functions that have important implications for Australia's national security and the public interest be placed in the hands of a for-profit company? So we've got a government that's intent on outsourcing and cost cutting but doesn't think through the full implications of these decisions—or they think them through, and they're not worried about them. What we get as a result of this approach are poorer decisions and poorer services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton, is less than receptive to approaches from the workers affected or their representatives from the Community and Public Sector Union. However, the minister should realise that the concerns held by thousands of visa service staff and their families will eventually be shared by the millions of Australians relying on the department for quality advice and decisions on the visa applications of friends, relatives and employees that they might support or sponsor. My Labor colleagues and I are extremely concerned about the implications this decision has not only for Public Service jobs but for the quality of visa advice and visa decisions and for national security. I can assure the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection that we will be pursuing this vigorously through Senate estimates and other processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I've got left today I want to speak about a completely different issue. I've often spoken in this place about the need for quality palliative and end-of-life care, and this topic has become even more personal for me as I've gone through the recent experience of spending time with my very closest friend in the final days of her life. While there's a big role in this for government and the health systems, it's important that we recognise the role that families, friends and carers of individuals play in this process. To highlight the importance of this, I note that a 2011 study by the Grattan Institute found that 70 per cent of Australians would prefer to die in their own home, surrounded by loved ones, yet only about 14 per cent do so. The overwhelming majority of Australians, 86 per cent, die in hospitals or in some sort of care facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is there such a huge gap between how Australians die and how they would prefer to die? The problem occurs, of course, mainly when a person who is dying loses either the mental or the physical capacity to communicate their care decisions. Unfortunately, many of these people do not communicate their decisions before they lose the capacity to do so. The time, therefore, to have these conversations is now—not next week, not next month, not next year, but now—before you need palliative or end-of-life care. Some illnesses and accidents, such as stroke or head trauma, can lead to a sudden inability to communicate your wishes, and then it's too late to have the conversation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most useful ways to ensure that you receive the care you want towards the end of life is to write an advance care directive. It's important to note that the law applies differently to advance care planning in each state and territory. In New South Wales and in Tasmania, my home state, advance care directives are enforceable under common law, even though there is no statutory mechanism to enforce them. In other states the names of statutory plans vary, from 'advance care directive' in South Australia and Victoria, to 'health direction' here in the ACT, to 'advance personal plan' in the Northern Territory and 'advance health directive' in Queensland and Western Australia. Most of these plans are accompanied by a number of non-statutory documents, such as a statement of choices, a statement of values and wishes, a goals of care form or a resuscitation plan. The Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria recognise interstate advance care directives, whereas Western Australia's State Administrative Tribunal can make an order to recognise an interstate directive. Queensland recognises interstate directives if the provisions and scope align with Queensland law. To find out more about the law relating to the appointment of a decision-maker and the enforceability of their plan, people should speak to the public guardian or advocate in the state or territory they live in or visit Advance Care Planning Australia's website, which is www.advancecareplanning.org.au.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if you've got a legally enforceable plan, it's absolutely vital that you have conversations about your future care with those who are going to be responsible for it. This is really important. My girlfriend and I had those discussions—in fact, we'd had discussions over many years about what we'd want if anything happened to us—and I was included by the family in all the discussions and meetings with the people caring for my friend. So it really is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some of the questions you might want to ask yourself before having a conversation about palliative or end-of-life care or writing an advance care directive: Who do you want to appoint to make decisions on your behalf? Under what circumstances would you accept resuscitation or life-prolonging treatment, or do you not want it at all? How and where would you like to spend your final days if you were able to make that choice? What are your fears about the end of your life, and what are your goals? Note that your decision-maker must be at least 18 years of age and should be someone who listens to, understands and respects your care decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important not only that you have the conversation with those who are likely to be responsible for making decisions on your behalf but that you speak to them all together as a group. One of the common problems in following a dying person's care wishes is when disputes erupt amongst family members about what the person actually wanted. So bringing everyone together for the conversation increases the chances of there being a clear and shared understanding of what you want. You should also discuss your end-of-life care with a health professional, who may be able to raise some issues and questions that you haven't thought of. But, let me be clear, writing an advanced care directive is no substitute for having these conversations. The combination of both the written plan and the conversation will give you the best chance of having your end-of-life wishes carried out. It's never too early or too late to start preparing for the death you might want. The time is now. Make a plan and start the conversation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  Next Thursday, 17 May, is IDAHOBIT. IDAHOBIT is not something out of Middle Earth or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord of the Rings</span><span style="font-style:italic;">;</span> it's the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism and Transphobia. It's a day to celebrate with our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer communities; it's a day to acknowledge their contribution; and it's a day to look forward to what still needs to be done for us to reach a society where same-sex attracted and gender diverse people are truly recognised and acknowledged as being equal members of our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since IDAHOBIT last year there have been some pretty significant achievements in Australian society. Since 17 May last—12 months ago—transgender young people no longer have to get the approval of the Family Court before they are able to have the life-affirming hormones that they require to affirm their identity as the person they really are. There was a court case that enabled that to be achieved. There was another court case that said that trans young people, where they know that they are transgender, where their families support them and where their medical practitioners all support them, are able to have surgery without having to get Family Court approval. These are two really significant things that have been achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had the first intersex focus event here at Parliament House, which put intersex issues on the agenda of politicians from across the spectrum. It was a really well attended event and got a lot of people in this place to think about intersex issues and people like they never have before. Intersex advocates are continuing to shine a light on the issues that they face and on the need to have greater acceptance of their rights, and with the affirmation of a statement that had intersex people from right around the country come together to produce what's called the Darlington Statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the big LGBTI achievement in Australia over the last 12 months was the achievement, finally, of marriage equality last December. I acknowledge Senator Dean Smith, who is in the chamber with me. It was huge. It has really changed the whole landscape for LGBTI people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Smith:</span>
                  </a>  The sun's still coming up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RICE:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, and here we are: the sun still comes up. In fact, I think it comes up brighter, shining more than it did before. Of course, we still don't quite have marriage equality, because we've still got forced divorce laws in place. The states have to change their laws for people who are married to a trans person. With my partner, Penny, and me, Penny still can't change her birth certificate, because the law has not yet been changed in Victoria. The law has been changed in the ACT and South Australia, but we are waiting for all states to come into line so we will finally, truly, have marriage equality for every single Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The joy that we felt in this place with the achievement of marriage equality, despite the very hard road that we had been put through to achieve it, was pretty amazing. But for me it has been surpassed by the weddings that I've been to over the last six months, since we achieved marriage equality, and by one in particular that I went to in Euroa just a month ago. There was a beautiful couple, Damian and Chris, who are very good friends of mine. The thing that moved me the most was that it was just a bog standard Australian wedding. They're both country people. They had country families come around, joining together with friends and family as Damian and Chris declared their love for each other and the fact that they wanted to live together and wanted to be married. Their families were there. It was beautiful. To know that we have achieved such a change in people's lives, because of the legislation that went through the parliament last December, is a big thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, when acknowledging and celebrating IDAHOBIT next Thursday, we also need to think about all the things that still need to be done. We still have religious exemptions that discriminate against LGBTI people, and there was the case last year of teachers in Catholic schools who were sacked—they were fired from Catholic schools because they came out as being same-sex-attracted. These are the sorts of cases that the Greens are going to continue to pursue. We need to make sure that we genuinely have rights for all LGBTI people across the spectrum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially we need a charter of rights here in Australia. We need a comprehensive human rights framework so that, yes, we can have protection of religious freedom, but we can also have the rights of LGBTI people being upheld. We still have surgeries being performed on young intersex babies and infants. This is very distressing because at that stage of their life, unless it is required for medical purposes, there is no reason why a young intersex baby should have surgery performed obviously without their consent. We don't know how they will want to express their sexuality, their sexual identity, their gender identity. It is much, much more sensible to wait until that person is old enough to be able to give consent before any surgery is undertaken. In fact, we had recommendations from a 2013 Senate inquiry into the issues and medical treatment of intersex people that were very clear that such surgery should not take place unless it was medically required. The intersex community is working very hard on this. The very first step in the Darlington Statement is to have a protocol developed to make sure that these surgeries don't take place unless they are absolutely medically required. I am certainly going to commit to working to make sure that such a protocol is developed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got trans and gender diverse people that still can't access the health care that they desperately need. They have limited access to health services. If you are a trans person or a gender diverse young person in Melbourne, you may be able to access all the services you need. But if you live in regional Australia, you are often left hanging out to dry. We need to have medical services available for our LGBTI community right across the country, for both mental health services and physical health services. We know that LGBTI people, because of discrimination that is still ongoing, can struggle with their mental health more than straight and cis people so we have to make sure those mental health services are available for them right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have the very real discrimination that goes on, the very real threat of violence, particularly against trans people. I have met so many trans people since May 2017 who have told me of their struggles and how they are still discriminated against, how that threat of violence is still there. So we need to be continuing to work in Australian society to be supporting them, to be advocating, to be out and proud and letting people know that trans and gender diverse people are to be celebrated and that their diversity is something to be welcomed, not something to be frightened of. Homophobia and transphobia are still very real. I heard an awful story just last week of a trans person who had undergone surgery, and their family had basically abandoned them so they were left to recover from their surgery without the support of their family, who basically said, 'We don't want to have anything more to do with you.' And it was only with the help of other trans people that they were able to feel supported. These are the sorts of attitudes that need to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously it is a long process of social change, but we need to have resources being put into services. We need to have Medicare coverage for all health services. We need to have support in our schools. The fact that the Safe Schools program is no longer funded at a federal level is a travesty. In yesterday's budget, there was almost a quarter of a billion dollars made available to the school chaplaincy program but no money for Safe Schools, which will support LGBTI people in a non-judgemental way. There is so much that can be done. Mental health services, funding for advocacy organisations and ending homelessness are all issues where trans and gender-diverse people are overwhelmingly affected. These are the things that the Greens will continue to focus on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise today to talk on last night's budget and, particularly, some of the issues from the budget that will directly impact rural and regional parts of Australia, particularly in my home state of WA. We've seen some tough economic times in the last few years: the impact of the global financial crisis; the end of the mining construction boom in Western Australia; significant volatility in commodity prices; and, of course, the large debt that we inherited from the previous government. We've come through those difficult economic times by sticking to a strong plan to turn the economy around. We're on track to deliver on this to continue to grow the economy and provide benefits to all Australians. I congratulate the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, on their hard work in steering our economy through these tough times and delivering another strong budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this budget does is build a stronger and more robust economy. It creates jobs, it invests in infrastructure and it seeks to attract even greater investment into our business community. This allows the government to guarantee those essential services that Australians need to get ahead to provide for their families. We've already heard a lot about significant tax relief. The government's economic plan will encourage and benefit working Australians with a lower, fairer and simpler tax system, starting with low- and middle-income earners. In the next year alone we will provide important relief to 10 million Australians, with about 4.4 million Australians receiving the maximum relief of $530 per year. In my home state of WA, the income tax relief will benefit over 1.1 million working Western Australians—that is, 1.1 million working Western Australians who get to keep more of their hard-earned income. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also provide significant support to Western Australia in recognition of its low GST share. This budget will encourage and enable business to invest, create more jobs, increase access to global markets to maximise the benefits to Australian companies and deliver infrastructure that the business community can depend upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan for a stronger economy will support more jobs for Australian families and their children, and set Australians up for greater prosperity. In Western Australia alone there are over 20,000 more people who have gotten jobs since the coalition was elected. We've seen the creation of a total of a million jobs since coming to office in September 2013, with around 1,000 net new jobs per day over the last year alone. Total employment and total full-time employment are both at record highs. We're also ensuring that older Australians have additional support to assess their skills and adapt to the changing economy so they can participate in the workforce and in the record number of jobs being created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a very significant infrastructure investment package, worth $75 billion, designed to connect our regions and cities, to bust congestion, to set business up to operate more efficiently, to get the goods that we produce to market more quickly and to keep our roads and our drivers safe. In Western Australia we've got $2.8 billion in new major projects, including the $944 million Perth congestion package which includes, most significantly, linking the Tonkin Highway down to the South Western Highway. This is in the electorate of my good friend Andrew Hastie, who has been a champion of this project for a long time. It will serve the Byford growth corridor very well into the future. It will also be a boon to the agricultural producers in the Waroona-Pinjarra-Harvey region, who will use this as part of their corridor to get their products to market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see $560 million for the Bunbury Outer Ring Road, a project championed by the local member, Nola Marino, for many years. It's a very important investment for Bunbury, one that will help both the City of Bunbury in its growth and allow the region that supports that city to continue to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, in the rural and regional space we've got a very significant commitment of $224 million of new funding for agriculture over five years. Importantly, we have $121 million for biosecurity. This is keeping our agricultural industry safe and making sure we protect it from pests and diseases that aren't currently present in Australia, and making sure that, when there is an outbreak of something, we will have the resources and capacity to deal with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another part of the budget that I'm very pleased to see is over $50 million for the growing Australian agricultural exports program, which is about reducing those non-tariff barriers to trade in key markets, particularly in those markets that are now starting to open up and that we are starting to see significant growth in thanks to the various free trade agreements that this government has been responsible for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also continuing work with the Indonesia-Australia red meat and cattle partnership. It is building on the good work that's already been done in that space, and helping that industry to continue to grow and to recover from the disastrous ban on live exports that occurred in 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen a commitment of $6.3 million, over two years, to improve access to agricultural and veterinary chemicals—again, very important—and $6.6 million to target pest animals and weed management. So, in all, this is a very significant budget that does deliver for agriculture and allows agriculture, particularly in my home state of WA, to continue to thrive and grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of other significant programs that will assist rural and regional Australia, of course, there's the $200 million to deliver the third round of the Building Better Regions Fund. That brings the total commitment in this program to $641 million. These deliver very important projects on the ground in our regional communities and are of vital importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few of the projects that've already been funded in this program are things like the Busselton jetty tourist precinct and the Busselton foreshore redevelopment, with a total commitment of $1.5 million, in a project worth $4.5 million—again, championed by the local member, Nola Marino.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Canning, championed by Andrew Hastie, we see the Waroona Housing Options Village. It is affordable accommodation for the aged—$1.7 million out of a total $3.3 million project. This includes construction of accommodation for nine modified disability units for older people and a community hub, gardens, grounds and pathways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the O'Connor electorate, championed by my good friend Rick Wilson, we see things like the South West Energy Experience—$2.7 million out of a total $6 million project. This is the construction of a multipurpose facility, including a retail space, function spaces, a museum, a workshop and a collection of old plant and equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are very important. They're small amounts of money for each individual project, but they are very important to each of those local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a more practical note, in Melissa Price's electorate of Durack, there is the Pilbara waste management facility with a commitment of $9 million in a $13 million project. It is very important to the town of Onslow and surrounding regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my remaining minute, I'll touch on rural health. Obviously, getting doctors, nurses and other parts of the rural workforce out into rural and regional Western Australia, and the rest of Australia, is vitally important and something that has always proved to be a challenge. So a Stronger Rural Health Strategy, with a $550 million commitment, is looking to transform rural and regional health delivery by strengthening local health services and delivering more doctors to rural and regional Australia. It means 3,000 additional doctors for rural Australia and 3,000 additional nurses. This is a very significant commitment to the bush, and comes on top of the commitment to the Royal Flying Doctor Service of $84 million to increase the availability of various services and to start to provide mental health services. In all, this is a very significant budget for rural and regional Australia and a very good budget for rural and regional Western Australia, and, in fact, it delivers for all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I rise today to talk about an issue which I am most passionate about, and that is the issue of the rights of workers and the struggle of the union movement to uphold the dignity of work for all Australian working men and women. This is an issue that has driven my working life as a union official and here in this place as a senator for Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just interesting to note that Monday this week happened to be Labour Day in the great state of Queensland. I took the opportunity, as I always do, to participate in Labour Day in Brisbane. For those listening to this speech today, if you happen to travel to Queensland on the first Monday of May of each year you will find that it is a day that is recognised as a public holiday, and that there is a significant march that takes place through some of the streets of the City of Brisbane. I'm very pleased to report that there were what appears to have been record crowds at this year's Labour Day march. Some reports were of 40,000 workers participating across Brisbane in the Labour Day celebration. Of course, we do have Labour Day marches throughout the states on that particular day, but the main one is in Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to be able to commemorate Labour Day back in May, which is where it belongs. Of course, Labour Day has huge historical significance in the state of Queensland, because it was first celebrated in Queensland in 1891. That was the same year as the Shearers' Strike, so in 2016 we celebrated the 125th anniversary of the Shearer's Strike and the first Labour Day. That was in May, and, unfortunately, the LNP government, in one of its more arrogant decisions, decided to move the Labour Day public holiday to later in the year. But I'm very pleased that the incoming Palaszczuk government made a commitment to change that and to bring it back to its true date in May.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to march with the SDA contingent on Labour Day on Monday. The ETU led the march and there were other unions involved: the Queensland Teachers' Union, the nurses' union, the Plumbers Union Queensland, the Australian Workers Union, the firies, the CFMEU and the Transport Workers Union, just to name a few unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour Day, as I said, is important in Queensland. We have a proud history of the union movement and, together with the Labor Party, our movement has fought for fair pay for fair work. We've fought for equal pay for men and women; for safe working conditions; for a better work-life balance and the importance of family in that consideration; and for penalty rates as compensation for unsociable work. Trading hours are important to retail workers, and it's important that the voice of retail workers is heard when the issue of shop trading hours is considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the key achievements of our movement most recently include the superannuation guarantee. That was achieved through the preparatory work that was done by the ACTU and various unions winning superannuation as an entitlement in their enterprise agreements. Then the Labor government came in to build in the superannuation guarantee as legislation. That was a very, very proud and significant achievement. There was also paid parental leave—a similar evolution there—and we have seen the evolution of the modern award system as well. And, of course, a huge achievement was the defeat of Work Choices in the 2007 federal election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took the opportunity last week to deliver a talk to some of the students at the University of Queensland student union at my old alma mater. They wanted somebody to talk to them about the issue of workers' rights and I was very pleased to go back onto the campus and talk to young people about this issue. For those listening to this speech, I do think workers' rights is an area that we need to continually focus on. Young people take for granted what their working rights are, and that leaves them very much exposed to unscrupulous employers out there. I think there is a huge level of ignorance as to what people's rights are when it comes to work, so I always take up the opportunity to talk about this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went back to basics on what our industrial relations system is all about. We talked about what is the minimum wage. People may not be aware that the national minimum wage is currently $18.29 per hour, or $694.90 for a 38-hour week, and, if you're a casual employee, you receive a 25 per cent casual loading on top of that. If you're younger than 21, then you will have a junior rate that is based on the percentage scale from the Miscellaneous Award 2010. A lot of people aren't aware of where these minimum wages come from. If you're not covered by an award, it's the federal minimum wage I just mentioned, but, if you are one of the majority of workers and covered by an award, it's that award that sets your minimum rate of pay. Where do these rates of pay come from? We need to reflect on the fact that, actually, every year the union movement argue before the Fair Work Commission's expert panel to get a fair and reasonable wage through the federal minimum wage and through the award system. We argue every year to try to get an improvement. When the union movement are arguing for pay rises, they're arguing not just for their union members; they're arguing for all workers, because the benefits of what the unions do and what they argue for eventually flow across the whole of the system. Of course, you often find employer organisations, which are unions for employers, arguing against those wage rises. This year, it's significant that the National Retail Association actually argued for a zero increase in wages for retail workers—a very lamentable position from the National Retail Association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People should be aware that they have the right to the National Employment Standards. Even if you're not covered by an award, these National Employment Standards cover things like your hours of work, flexible working arrangements, leave entitlements, public holidays, termination and redundancy conditions, and the requirement for a Fair Work information statement. This law protects workers from being paid less than the minimum wage, even if they agree to it. A lot of people think, if their employer tells them, 'This is the rate of pay,' then that's what the law provides. If your employer misleads you on that, you have rights to go back through the Fair Work Ombudsman or through your union, particularly, to claim back pay if you've been underpaid by virtue of an award or another minimum wage entitlement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also talked about the benefits of collective bargaining, which is a fundamental principle of the labour movement. Collective bargaining helps to combat inequality through the redistribution of wealth. I note that the International Monetary Fund just recently issued a paper on inequality in labour market institutions. They observed that a 10 per cent decline in union density correlates to a five per cent increase in the top 10 per cent income share. Most people think that perhaps union density or membership levels declining has an impact on low-income workers. Yes, it does, but also there is a corollary to that, which is that the share of income for people in the top 10 per cent goes up. This relates to income inequality. We're finding that collective bargaining levels are at record lows in Australia currently under this federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was talking to these students, we talked about where to go for help. For the benefit of listeners, I want to go through that again today. The Fair Work Commission is something that people shouldn't take for granted. It's a national tribunal that deals with awards and agreements and sets those conditions. It deals with unfair dismissal, so, if you feel that you've been dismissed unfairly, you have rights to go to the Fair Work Commission in some circumstances. You can make applications to stop bullying and have disputes resolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Ombudsman also performs a valuable service, although I think it's very much under-resourced. But, of course, unions are there to help people, and I encourage anybody listening to this speech to go and find out which is the relevant union that covers their particular industry. You can do that through the ACTU and find out which union you should be working with and supporting, because ultimately it is only the union movement and, through it, the Labor Party which is working for the benefit of ordinary working people, to reduce levels of inequality and to bring fairness back to Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="273829" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANNING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I rise to speak about the overallocation of resources to the south-east corner of Queensland. Queensland is the most decentralised state, with the highest proportion of people living outside the capital city. Queensland is also geographically huge; if we were a country, Queensland would be the 14th-largest country in the world. We are much more than a single city, but you wouldn't know it from the way governments spend our hard-earned tax dollars. Time and time again, we see our tax dollars poured into Brisbane, and those in regional and rural areas languish on the end of a shoestring. While the Queensland government spends $5½ billion on the Cross River Rail project, the rest of the state has to put up with inadequate roads and infrastructure, poor health services and not enough water, the Treasurer's welcome announcement yesterday of a much-needed $3 billion for the Bruce Highway notwithstanding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this funding being for a painfully slow process to upgrade the dangerous national highway, our roads are absolutely essential and can't be properly maintained by spending on a per-capita basis. Road costs don't accrue per person, they accrue per kilometre. Brisbane has a lot of people, and they do need to have proper transport infrastructure, but Brisbane contains only a tiny fraction of the many thousands of kilometres of roads in this state. The vast majority of our roads are in regional Queensland, and that is where the vast majority of our transport spending needs to be. After all, it's where the produce comes from that drives our state and our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Roads, however, are not the only critical infrastructure where regional Queensland is left behind. Access to essential health services is yet another issue. I recently spoke to a constituent from Mount Isa who has to travel regularly to Brisbane for urgent medical care for his wife due to not having access anywhere near where they live. During the recent floods in the area, the cost of flights out of Mount Isa more than tripled. Imagine having to fork out thousands of dollars to travel for essential health care simply because of where you live. Many of these hardworking Queensland farmers are already doing it tough. These stories are not uncommon and are heartbreaking. Thankfully, the government has announced it will fund a stronger regional health program by providing increased incentives for students to study medicine in regional areas and then transition into working in rural communities. However, more can always be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural Queensland needs greater funding to build better hospitals and attract specialist doctors and surgeons to provide often lifesaving medical treatment. In addition to funding for hospitals, rural Queenslanders are continually denied the resources that we need to maintain and grow our economy. We are continually starved of essential water infrastructure. Townsville continues to struggle with a water crisis that is a long way from being resolved, thanks to inaction and complacency from inner-city governments. The Rookwood Weir has only just gotten the go-ahead after many, many years of unnecessary delays, and we have yet to get a commitment towards the Bradfield scheme with the Hells Gate Dam and Tully-Millstream, which we have been calling for in North Queensland for 80 years now. You couldn't imagine a government that would ever neglect the south-east corner's water needs in that way. It would never be tolerated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure cheap, reliable electricity for all Queenslanders. We need to continue to build coal-fired power stations to ensure this supply. One in Collinsville would help to prevent other Australian businesses like QAL in Gladstone having to lay off 150 good, hardworking men and women because they couldn't afford the power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even when the government announces funding for regional areas, we see definitions getting stretched in ways that short-change the regions. In yesterday's budget, we saw $123.6 million over four years allocated for regional universities. This is very welcome. However, in Queensland, our share of that funding is being allocated to the University of the Sunshine Coast's Moreton Bay campus. I don't mean to imply that USC is an undeserving university, but the Moreton Bay campus is just a short drive north of Brisbane's CBD. It is quite a stretch to call it 'regional'. We have universities all over regional Queensland that are crying out for support. USC itself has locations in Gympie and the Fraser Coast. We have other universities in Cairns, Townsville, Emerald and elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to ways to support regional Queensland universities, we have plenty of options. Unfortunately, we see the options being chosen to give regional funding to campuses that only meet the definition of 'regional' in the most technical of ways. This perpetuates the myth we see with our young people getting the message that, if they want the best education, they need to pack up and move to Brisbane. Our best and brightest get pulled away from areas that are begging for more people, which makes it all the more harder for us to build a better future in the regions. We need to change the mindset here: we need to think about the needs of Queensland as a whole, and not just the south-east corner.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  It was a great honour last week to take part in the National Memorial Service for Fire and Emergency Services Personnel. This moving ceremony was an opportunity to remember and commemorate those men and women who have died in the line of duty while fighting fires and responding to emergencies across Australia. The service took place across the lake here in Canberra at one of the lesser-known but no less important memorials on and around Anzac Parade—the National Emergency Service Memorial on Rond Terrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The service included the unveiling of a new memorial wall that commemorates those who lost their lives defending our communities. Over 500 men and women are memorialised on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. I encourage all senators and those in the other place to get across to the north shore of the lake and visit it while in Canberra. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge Paul Baxter, president of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authority Council, and Stuart Ellis, the CEO of the council. We had representatives from right around the country and, in fact, the families of some of those who had lost their lives fighting for life and property in fire and emergency services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge Mr Angus Taylor, who was there to officially unveil the memorial wall representing the Prime Minister. It was a great honour to be involved in the ceremony and, once again, I encourage all senators and members to make a visit to the memorial at the earliest opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, I was able to take part in the JDRF One Ride in South Australia. It was a ride to raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, who invest in research and support for families who have kids with type 1 diabetes. I've gotten to know a lot of families who deal with type 1 diabetes over recent years. It is a very tough and very challenging condition to deal with for a family, particularly with young children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that JDRF does—not just looking for a cure but also supporting families through these difficult times—is incredibly valuable for our entire community. The ride was tough but rewarding, and it was made a bit easier thanks to the generosity of many Canberrans who donated nearly $4,000 to the cause in my name.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to thank those who donated to my ride: Michael Taylor, Lee Gloyne, Ken Kroeger, Yohan Ramasundara, Stephen Sharp, Robert Downie, Martin Gordon, Keith Maxted, Michael Fitzgerald, Craig and Carolyn Jamieson, Lyn Pezzullo, Peter Cain, Anna Topic, Don Harris, Kevin Riley, Sarah McHugh, Michael Hogg, Ian Gardner, Niral Shah, Anthony Cook, Hank and Karen Oerlemans, Steve Butler, Wilhelm Harnisch, Jan Swift, Albert Orszaczky, Andrew Hiebl, Ignatius Rozario, Angela Moyle, Tim Efkarpidis, Craig Edwards, June O'Donnell, John Somerville, Jane Hiatt, Anne Prendergast, Robert and Judith Gunning. Thank you to all of them, and thank you to all those who organised the ride and those who do such great work for JDRF. It is a wonderful organisation that was, very much, founded by families who are dealing with type 1 diabetes. It's a very close-knit community. In recent years, I've been very proud that the Commonwealth has been able to deliver, in a number of ways, supports for people living with type 1. Ultimately, we want to find a cure—that's what these fundraisers are about—so people don't have to continue to deal with what is a very, very difficult condition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another issue, earlier in April I was very pleased to help start up a Red25 team with the Canberra Liberals to assist with blood and plasma donation in the ACT. Eighteen life-giving treatments can be made from plasma donations. From protecting kids from chickenpox to treating severe burns victims and treating brain disorders, donated plasma improves quality of life for so many Australians and saves the lives of many others. A brand-new plasma donor centre opened at the beginning of April—only the second of its kind in Australia—collecting only plasma donations. It's an important centre not only to provide more opportunities for Canberrans to donate plasma but also to raise awareness of the importance of plasma donations in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after the centre opened I went to visit the new facilities, give a donation and learn about the importance of plasma donations to Australians. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service have declared that the need for healthy plasma donors is greater than at any other time in our history. The demand for immunoglobulin, a blood product made from plasma and used to treat many autoimmune and infectious diseases, rose by 11 per cent last year, but plasma donations across the country rose by only five per cent. Currently, Australians relying on plasma based treatments are relying on mostly imported plasma. It's important to encourage those Australians who can give to take the time to make an appointment and donate, to decrease our reliance on imports of this life-giving product. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having visited the centre in Civic, it's a pretty enjoyable process. It's relatively simple and straightforward. It's very similar to giving blood. The centre is very well kitted out, and they look after you very, very well. There's free wi-fi there and food and drinks are available. So it's somewhere people can drop in on the way home from work or in their lunch break, and they would be doing an amazing service for people who desperately need this plasma for all sorts of life-saving treatments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to pay tribute to a number of young people. I will be forming a youth advisory council once again this year. In fact, just this afternoon, we'll be having a meeting here at Parliament House. I'm looking forward to talking through some of the big issues that young people care about—issues they want to raise, issues of concern—and hearing from them about how I and others in this place can continue to serve them and continue to serve our young people. Last year on the council the members came up with projects to address some of the problems facing our local community. This year the new council will continue to work by advancing some of the best ideas that came forward. The idea is: they pitch an idea, they look at a community need, they come up with what the problem is, they come up with some solutions and they look at some strategies as to how they might engage the political process or other processes to get a solution. So it's a way of them learning about the political process and public life, but it's also about problem-solving and about community engagement—the idea of working with your community, your local members of parliament, your federal members of parliament or other community leaders to get real outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a number of impressive young people, some of whom I've met and some of whom I'm yet to meet. I'm looking forward to welcoming them. We've got: Shriya Bellamkonda-Vaka from Canberra Girls Grammar School, Aden Pulford from Gungahlin College, Thu Vu from Daramalan College, Giuseppe Trimboli from St Edmund's College, Ruben Mayenco from St Mary MacKillop College, Maggie Potter from Radford College, Alex Lawton from Melrose High School, Methmi Fernando from Daramalan College, Ethan Raats from Trinity Christian School, Patrick Phillips from Daramalan College, Joshua Dias from Radford College, Jarell Cubarrubia from UC High School Kaleen, Paige Fittler from Amaroo School, Enling Liao from Lyneham High School, Hannah Spinaze from Canberra College, Gian Ojunga from Emmaus Christian School, Kathryn Corner from Emmaus Christian School and Luke Palisi from Marist College.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I apologise for some of my pronunciations. When I meet the young people today I can apologise to them in person and learn how to properly pronounce their names. Can I just say to those young people: it is a great thing to be getting involved in, and it will be a great learning experience. We've got an amazing group of young people here in Canberra. I get to schools right across the sector—both the public and the non-government school sectors—here in Canberra. We've got some amazing schools, and we've got some amazing school leaders. I've seen them right across from the north in Gungahlin to the south in Tuggeranong, to Belconnen to Weston Creek, and to the inner north and inner south. There are some amazing school communities and some amazing school leaders. I very much look forward to working with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Civics education is something that I think we need to focus on more in this country. This idea that young people should learn about how parliament works is critically important. Just on that, I will make mention of Tony Pasin, whose electorate I visited just recently. I saw him hold court with a school group of year 7s and do a mock parliament. I've got to say, the member for Barker does it better than anyone I've seen. Tony Pasin is the standout when it comes to running a mock parliament. Congratulations to Tony and all of the young people who've put their hands up for the youth advisory council.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="SR5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge Justice Anthony North of the Federal Court and his contribution to the judiciary and his role in the native title context over the past two decades particularly in Western Australia. Last week, I had the privilege to travel to Beagle Bay, which is north of Broome, where Justice North delivered an on-country determination for the Bindunbur, the Jabirrjabirr/Ngumbarl and the Nyulnyul native title claims. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These claims were the last Justice North delivered before his retirement from the Federal Court in September. The judgement recognised the Nyulnyul, the Nimanburru and the Jabirrjabirr/Ngumbarl people as the native title holders over a combined area of approximately 12,000 square kilometres of the middle Dampier Peninsula of Western Australia's Kimberley region. The determination extends from Willie Creek in the south to Pender Bay and Disaster Bay in the north. It includes the Lacepede Islands, the Beagle Bay community, pastoral stations and unallocated crown land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The judgement brought to an end the first litigated native title claim to occur in the Kimberley in the past 10 years. Approximately 80 per cent of the Kimberley region is now recognised as native title land. Justice North and the Federal Court have played a significant role in this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was through the Karajarri native title claim back in 2002 that I first got to meet Justice North and his family. Subsequently, I had the honour of showing him the outcomes from a determination of native title for my own people, the Yawuru people, in Broome. I showed him the Nyamba Buru Yawuru offices in Broome and the work they are undertaking as part of the implementation from a successful determination. Judges don't often get to see that part of their work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this Bindunbur claim, each of the native title claimant groups put aside their differences, focused on the common good and worked for the better outcome. The pride they brought to all of us at Beagle Bay when the determination was delivered gave us all a sense of great joy and hope for their future—even though we know there'll be challenges that come their way. For First Nations peoples, native title can be a very vexing process. Justice North has demonstrated leadership, respect and understanding throughout his career. He will be sadly missed, but I hope that future lawyers and jurists continue his impassioned contribution to native title and demonstrate a true capacity to listen to First Nations peoples in their proceedings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a credit to the Federal Court that it has adopted procedures to allow hearings on country and adapted their practices to enable the court to listen to applicants in the most respectful way. To see the court sitting in a remote location and trying conditions for staff and for litigants but honouring the claimants is something that all Australians can be proud of. As I stood watching Justice North deliver the judgement, I reflected on the fact that, while native title determinations recognise First Nations people's ancient connections to country, the bigger picture of this nation—our parliament—is yet to recognise first peoples in our founding document.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the words of the Nyul Nyul traditional owner and native title holder Mary O'Reeri: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have lost a lot of our old people who have advocated and fought very hard to see this day of recognition. Having our native title recognised is a welcome achievement for the Nyul Nyul people. Native title gives us as Traditional Owners a much stronger position at the table to negotiate agreements for our country. Native title for us is a tool to work together and aim to bring prosperity in many ways for our people. Our apical ancestors' spirits will be with us every step of the way. We owe it to them and our future generations moving forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice North made it clear at the hearing that this would be his last determination. He thanked the many different groups that he'd had to work for and he certainly thanked the community of Beagle Bay for the hospitality that they extended and, in particular, the young people, who waited patiently for the formalities to be concluded and then sang in Nyul Nyul, of all things, the Lord's Prayer. It was a great occasion for all involved and truly an occasion where the court, the advocates, the state and the representatives celebrated something.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice North also indicated that he had carried around with him in his proceedings an old Akubra hat that his father had bequeathed to him, and on it or around it were many feathers that people had gifted to him as a consequence of his participation in the work of recognising their native title. This indeed was a great occasion and certainly a difficult area, a difficult path for traditional owners to tread down, but it was a great occasion to see native title applicants, with their diversity, coming together, recognising the need for a common approach and a focus on the future of their generations going forward. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  In the minute and a half that's left in senators' statements I'm prompted to raise an issue which Senator Dodson did about our obligation to future generations. I think there's no more poignant or pertinent time to discuss this than when the budget comes out and you've got hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of debts that have been accrued by this parliament and the previous two or three parliaments that future generations are going to have to pay back. I think this is a moral obligation that is incumbent upon all of us. The government, to its credit, has mapped out a path of fiscal repair, although there is some $32 billion or $33 billion worth of additional deficit spending in the next couple of years. But we need to work together to reduce that, to stop the wasteful expenditure, to stimulate our economy as much as we possibly can, because anything else is an abrogation of our duty.</span>

It has been destroyed by decisions in this place. We need to rectify it. We need to get behind budget repair as a matter of priority and urgency.</span>

The medium-term cost for the unlegislated component of the enterprise tax plan currently before the Senate is $35.6 billion over the period from 2016-17 to 2027-28. The projected cost of the unlegislated component of the enterprise tax plan in 2027-28 is around $9.8 billion. There is no new measure in the budget. As Senator Wong would well know, measures in past budgets do not get recosted.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us just talk about the Labor Party tax policy, because the Labor Party, based on past costings, want to impose $220 billion in higher taxes on the Australian economy, which will send investment overseas, lower growth, lead to fewer jobs and higher unemployment and, as we get higher unemployment, lead to lower wages. So how much additional tax is the Labor Party going to impose on the Australian economy? Have they updated the costings of their $220 billion tax hit on Australian workers, Australian savers, Australian pensioners and Australian self-funded retirees? Every Australian who moves will be on the receiving end of a tax hike from the Labor Party.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government believe in the opportunity for all Australians to get ahead. We believe in encouraging and backing hardworking Australians. We believe hardworking Australians deserve the best possible opportunity to get ahead, so we will continue to pursue policies of lower taxes where we can and where that can be responsibly afforded within the budget. We know that Australia's success depends on the success of individual Australians. We understand that the success of all Australians depends on the efforts of every individual Australian doing their best and working hard, and they deserve to be rewarded for their efforts.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator CORMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I thank Senator Hume for that question. She clearly has a great interest in the strength of the Australian economy. When our government was elected in 2013, we inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a budget position that was rapidly deteriorating. Let me repeat that: when Mr Shorten and Mr Bowen were defeated at the 2013 election, they left behind a weakening economy at a time when commodity prices for our key commodity exports were way above what they are in our budget now, they left behind rising unemployment and they left behind a budget position that was deteriorating by a staggering $3 billion a week. In the 11 weeks between Labor's last budget and the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the budget position deteriorated by $3 billion a week, at a time when the price of iron ore was still above $120 a tonne. We're now forecasting our budget on the basis of $55 a tonne, just to use one example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of our plan for a stronger economy and more jobs, and our plan to get the budget back into surplus, we are in a much better position now. Our economic growth outlook is better, employment growth is much stronger—in 2017, 415,000 new jobs were created—and, of course, our budget is back on track to a surplus one year early: a $2.2 billion surplus in 2019-20, followed by an $11 billion surplus in 2020-21, a $16.6 billion surplus in 2021-22, rising to over one per cent of GDP by 2026-27, and in surplus all the way through the medium term. As of this year, the government no longer has to borrow to fund our day-to-day expenses. That's been the result of fiscal restraint. It's been the result of stronger growth on the back of our plan for a stronger economy and more jobs. We inherited four per cent spending growth from Labor locked into legislation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is why we want to ensure that we can provide income tax relief to Australian families—prioritising low- and middle-income earners (1) because we want to support them to deal with cost-of-living pressures, (2) because we want to address bracket creep, because bracket creep is a drag on economic growth, and (3) because we want to simplify the tax system. While we will prioritise low- and middle-income earners, we do believe it is important that the tax policy settings for personal income tax overall are lowered, and that is why, over a seven-year plan which is fully costed, which is affordable and which is reflected in our budget bottom line, we are putting forward a seven-year plan which provides— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A stronger economy is central to everything, and what we've been able to achieve as a result of our plan is stronger revenue flows to government on the back of stronger growth—and do you know where it came from? Predominantly, from increases in personal income tax revenue as a result of 415,000 additional Australians in work. We have been able to help, since we came into government, 140,000 Australians off welfare and into a job. That means less expenditure on welfare. It means more revenue on personal income tax.

Since the coalition formed government in 2013, pensions have increased by more than $99 per fortnight for singles and by more than $149 per fortnight for couples. Pensions will continue to rise twice a year. The age pension is paid at the highest fortnightly rate of income support payments and has the most generous indexation arrangements in Australia's social security system.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, the government made a decision to rebalance the age pension asset test to make the system better targeted and more sustainable. As part of this change, we also raised the asset test threshold, making it more generous to people with modest levels of assets. From 1 January 2017, around 165,000 pensioners began receiving an average $25 more per fortnight as part of the government's decision, and this included around 47,000 part-pensioners who then qualified for the full pension. Ninety per cent of pensioners are either better off or have no change to their pension under the measures. Of course, those opposite have already banked the savings of this decision at the 2016 election. So I ask those opposite—</span>

You, opposite, to ensure that the pension was sustainable—we supported your move to a higher pension age in 2009. In 2009 you were in government. You made the decision to increase the pension age, and we supported you. So, while it is not yet legislated, raising the age pension qualification age to 70 by 2035 remains government policy. You started the process by increasing the pension age from 67. We are following through what you started.</span>

Minister, can you explain why your US-style tax cuts that give someone like a stockbroker or a politician on $200,000 an extra $7,000 in their pocket while someone, say, a graduate childcare worker, on $40,000 gets only a few extra hundred dollars?

An Australian taxpayer earning $30,000, under our plan to provide immediate tax relief to low- and middle-income earners, gets 8.3 per cent in income tax cuts, whereas a high-income earner—somebody on $200,000, as you've referenced—gets a 0.2 per cent cut in income tax under the initial—in fact, over the first four years, the value of the income tax cut for somebody earning $200,000 is 0.2 per cent. In every year, for somebody earning $30,000, it's an 8.3 per cent tax cut. For everyone earning $50,000 a year, it is a 6.2 per cent tax cut. So, clearly, the tax cut is very much directed and targeted at low- and middle-income earners. We are prioritising low- and middle-income earners.</span>

I would invite them to go and have a look. I know that that is the model that the Greens and the Labor Party subscribe to these days.</span>

Let me repeat that: under the coalition, as a result of our policies, bulk-billing rates for patients visiting their GP are at record highs. And bulk-billing rights, in case the good doctor has forgotten about it, mean no out-of-pocket costs. So I don't know what he's talking about, but clearly it has been a long time since he's worked as a doctor.</span>

Our budget is forecast to return to surplus by 2019-20 and it's projected to remain in surplus all the way through the medium term to 2028-29. In fact, we are projected to return to a surplus in excess of one per cent of the share of GDP by 2026-27. By definition, that means that all of the expenditure on the important essential services that Australians expect in health, in education—you name it—is guaranteed. That is one of our core objectives: to ensure that the funding for the essential services that Australians rely on is guaranteed within our budget while the government lives within its means.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Jobs and Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  Thank you to Senator Colbeck for the question. Last night Australians saw our Treasurer set out our government's plan for a stronger economy, and this of course includes backing business to invest more—of course, ultimately, to create more jobs. Last year, 2017, saw the strongest year of jobs growth on record. In excess of 415,000 more jobs were created and, colleagues, three-quarters of those jobs were full-time jobs. In the last 12 months of the former Labor government, do you know what happened to full-time jobs? The economy actually shed around 17,000 full-time jobs. Sixteen consecutive months of jobs growth is the longest Australia has ever seen on record. Under this government, in excess of a thousand jobs are being created per day. In fact, as a result of our record on jobs growth, the proportion of working-age Australians now dependent on welfare has fallen—that's right—to the lowest level in 25 years. On this side of the chamber, we will never shy away from the fact that the best form of welfare is a job.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How are we doing it? We are putting in place the right economic framework that backs business. How are we doing that? We are legislating tax cuts for all businesses, prioritising small and medium businesses first. We are delivering infrastructure that supports industries and jobs. Why? It's because on this side of the chamber we know a stronger economy means more business investment and the creation of more jobs.</span>

Last night, the Treasurer recognised that there are certain Australians out there who will need additional assistance to gain new employment or to stay in the workforce. These are, of course, mature-age employees. Mature-age workers, as we know, bring a wealth of experience to employers, but we also know they may actually struggle to find work, particularly when they are in industries that are in transition. Last night, the Treasurer outlined that the Turnbull government will invest almost $190 million on a range of jobs and skills measures to help our mature-age Australians find the right job, stay in the workforce, have the flexibility they require later in their working life and, of course, retire with security.</span>

The fundamental difference between those on that side of the chamber and those of us on this side of the chamber is that we believe the best form of welfare is a job. As our leader in the Senate, Senator Cormann, has already articulated, what would a Shorten Labor government do? Mr Shorten and Labor actually want to increase taxes on Australians. That's right—those opposite want to increase taxes by more than $200 billion. It doesn't stop there. They want to impose new and increased taxes on electricity, small and family businesses, incomes, housing, investment and retirees. What does that mean for the Australian people? It means that under Labor they would pay more and their jobs would be at risk.</span>

Infrastructure in this country is determined, at least by this government, in a methodical assessment. It is not divided up on the basis of population. I'm often reminded of this in my home jurisdiction of the Northern Territory. We have a population slightly bigger than Bondi—it's about 228,000—and people argue that we might have a greater amount of GST or that, for the number of people we have, we have more infrastructure funding. But that's just not how it works in a federation. So I believe that the government is investing in the right projects both in South Australia and right across Australia. But, if there are some particular issues, Senator Patrick, where you think the priorities need to be readjusted, I will be more than happy to make an appointment with the minister so you can bring those matters up with him.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I don't believe in simply carving up the infrastructure funding bucket, as I have indicated, based on the number of people. As you would expect, some jurisdictions have greater needs than others, and I hope you would also agree that infrastructure needs of jurisdictions change from year to year. We accept that, and that's why we approach infrastructure in the way we do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But South Australia will absolutely benefit from the investments we're making as part of this investment pipeline. There are projects such as the $220 million for the Gawler rail line electrification. I know that that is a high priority. There is $160 million for the duplication of the Joy Baluch AM Bridge and $177 million for the north-south corridor Regency Road to Pym Street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, thanks for the question. I can assure you and all South Australians that we do fund infrastructure across the nation in line with the most rigorous and comprehensive assessment process.</span>

One of the issues when we talk about money—and I do take on board that some of the heckling around the enormous investment in South Australia in Defence obviously has nothing to do with your question, and I accept that, Senator. When we talk about the $220 million, the $160 million, $1.77 million or in fact the $3.6 billion, I think what is lost in that regard is the actual number of jobs that this equates to. This is funding for a population of, as I have indicated, not a huge amount, but this equates to generating at least 550 jobs, and I think that, with that amount of jobs, they're the sorts of things that South Australians are talking about.

As I reiterated, Senator, this is a methodical assessment and this is the same process that is applied—yes, when we live in less populated centres like South Australia and the Northern Territory, none of our constituents enjoy the fact that we're spending $5 billion on infrastructure in Victoria and they're all saying, 'Why can't they do it in that state?' I do sympathise with you. But, again, I would reiterate that this is a methodical assessment of infrastructure priorities. They are taken through Infrastructure Australia. We believe in government that this is the best way to invest. This isn't just a pork-barrelling exercise; this is about making sure that our priorities are actually matched with the needs of infrastructure in Australia.</span>

I'm really thrilled to be standing in this place today to update the Senate on what we are doing as a government to meet the future infrastructure needs of our nation. For all Australians, no matter where they live, we on this side have got a real plan and we have put real money on the table to deliver on that plan—$75 billion over the next 10 years. That is record funding to build the infrastructure of the 21st century. We're investing in a credible, decade-long pipeline of infrastructure projects focusing on driving economic growth, increasing productivity and connectivity and also creating, of course, new employment opportunities. This pipeline will create around 50,000 additional direct or indirect jobs over a decade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $5 billion for construction of a rail link to Melbourne Airport, $1.1 billion for Perth's METRONET program, $400 million to duplicate a section of the Botany rail line to construct the Cabramatta loop, $390 million for the upgrade of the Beerburrum to Nambour line on the Sunshine Coast, $300 million for the Brisbane Metro project, $220 million for the electrification of the Gawler line, $1 billion for the M1 motorway corridor, $3.3 billion for the Bruce Highway—I know that will be very welcome—$1.4 billion for Adelaide's North-South Corridor, $971 million to build the Coffs Harbour bypass, $1.75 billion for the new North East Link in Melbourne, $560 million to deliver stages 2 and 3 of the Bunbury Outer Ring Road in Western Australia, and $280 million for regional roadworks and jobs in the Northern Territory.

Almost three years ago today, the Senate supported my motion for an inquiry into third-party food certification. The inquiry reported on 1 December 2015 and significantly focused on the scams and rorts within the halal certification industry, recommending that a single halal certification authority be created. This echoed a 1981 royal commission finding into the meat export industry, recommending an official Australian government certificate and stamp for halal slaughter certification in Australia. The inquiry identified that bribery, corruption, dodgy certificates and crooked dealings are endemic in the halal certification industry. Given these actions are a cost borne by Australian companies and consumers, why is the government continuing 37 years of inaction on halal certification, leaving Australians open to rip-offs and unnecessary additional costs?</span>

I add that many of the recommendations in the Senate inquiry on the issue of third-party certification went to issues that relate to state and territory governments.</span>

In my home state of South Australia, an Adelaide mosque's own records indicate that it earns $200,000 a year from halal certification, and yet, by their own admission, the cost to operate that process is just $300. If this government is committed to removing red tape, and given the scams in this industry, will the government accredit one national certifier funded by a cost recovery, rather than allow the racketeers to profit at the expense of every Australian?</span>

I can't comment on any individual cases that Senator Bernardi has raised. I don't have information about them, but I should note that in the government's response to the Senate inquiry it noted that a review in 2011 had found that halal certification did not add materially to the costs for consumers of products in Australia. I would also add that it's very important that Australia maintains market access for red meat to other countries. There are complications in the sense that different countries and, indeed, different customers within those countries sometimes have different requirements, so I don't necessarily think it is as simple as Senator Bernardi has presented it. But, as I indicated in my answer to the first question, the government does takes these matters seriously and is working with industry to improve the monitoring and enforcement of the regime.</span>

When will the government take meaningful actions to save Australians and install such a certification?</span>

To clarify the answer I gave earlier: it's not just the countries involved; it's also the customers in the industry. Obviously, we don't sell red meat to countries; we sell red meat to overseas customers. It's something the government is taking seriously and making sure it works through it in a methodical way.</span>

It draws on the needs of Australians in this country, who, as they age, want greater choices. We are living longer, as we heard. We want to support Australians, as they live longer, to live fuller, more independent lives. What the findings and the research suggest, when I head out to the regions, is that Australians want to stay in their homes longer. So we need to ensure we have the relevant support packages ready and able to be used for them. We have record aged-care funding in the budget—an additional $5 billion over the next four years. That's the reality. So I know the opposition likes to make some rhetorical arguments around our lack of support here, but the facts speak for themselves. There is record funding into aged care—</span>

But given the need of the opposition to know the specifics, I am advised that greatly improved access to residential aged care with a growth 13,500 new aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places as well as a $60 million capital investment are the specifics around the aged-care packages, bearing in mind that Australians are wanting to stay in their homes longer and we want to give them the support they need as they age.</span>

There are more than 100,000 older Australians still waiting for in-home care, with the waiting list growing by 20,000 older Australians in the last six months of 2017 alone. Can the minister confirm that the 14,000 aged-care packages funded over the next four years will not even keep up with demand?</span>

Over 50 per cent of those on the national waiting list are actually in an aged-care package. They're waiting for another type of package. So I think to say there is a waiting list of 100,000 is actually incorrect. What the government should be focused on is ensuring that Australians, as they age, have the support to make the choices that they see fit for their lives. If they choose not to take up a residential aged-care package, but instead to use it for additional high-quality support to stay longer in their own home, then our government wants to support them to do that. That is their choice. The choice to not go into residential care but to have— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That means being socially connected, being physically active, having the right support to make the financial decisions you need to ensure that you have a secure future and having the care you choose—whether you choose to have the type of package which includes meal preparation and assistance around the home with odd jobs, or whether you actually need further measures.</span>

Last night, the Treasurer announced a budget that delivers for older Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget includes $258 million for initiatives to support the incomes of those in retirement. The Treasurer said that this year's budget would guarantee essential services that Australians rely on, like Medicare, hospitals, schools and caring for older Australians. The Pension Loans Scheme will be open to all older Australians, including full-rate pensioners and self-funded retirees, so that they can boost their retirement income by up to $17,800 for a couple without impacting on their eligibility for the pension or other benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will support older Australians to stay in the workforce by providing wage subsidies of up to $10,000 for employers who employ older Australians. We will expand the Entrepreneurship Facilitators program and create a new skills and training incentive to provide mature-age workers with the opportunity to update their skills. And, to support the choice of older Australians who wish to stay at home, the government will increase the number of home care places by 14,000 over four years at a cost of $1.6 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will help Australians plan for a longer and healthier life with new online skills and health checks at ages 45 and 65 years linked to programs that can help them better prepare. We will fund targeted programs run by local sporting organisations and community groups to encourage older Australians to remain physically active for longer. And, of course, we will oppose unfair tax grabs on retirees and pensioners by enabling everyone who has invested in Australian companies that issue franked dividends to keep their tax refunds, unlike those opposite who are raiding the pockets, the purses and the bank accounts of those hardworking Australians who have been saving all of their lives.</span>

Currently, the first $250 of employment income a fortnight is not counted in the pension income test and the work bonus does not currently apply to earnings from self-employment. Increasing the work bonus to $300 per fortnight will mean eligible pensioners get more benefit from working. The current bonus was set at $250 per fortnight when introduced in 2011 and has not been increased since.</span>

By giving pensioners the ability to work for themselves to get the pensioner work bonus rewards those people who want to work more. It means that those who want to stay in the workforce can, particularly if they are retiring from being a self-employed worker. The government will not punish those who make a contribution—those who work for themselves. We want to reward that attitude and ensure that pensioners have a range of options in their retirement.</span>

He is dead wrong, as is quite customary. It wouldn't surprise anybody on this side of the chamber to know that Senator Cameron frequently comes into this chamber and makes stuff-ups, essentially, because for Senator Cameron it's all just one long diatribe. One long diatribe with occasional bursts of intermission is what we get from Senator Doug Cameron.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the Turnbull government stands committed to the $1.5 billion Skilling Australians Fund. The Skilling Australians Fund is being implemented to make sure we get accountability from states and territories to boost the number of apprenticeships and to overcome the decline in apprenticeships that came about following the 2012 budget decisions of the previous Labor government. They precipitated a decline in apprenticeship commencements and therefore the decline we have had ever since in apprenticeships being undertaken and, ultimately, apprenticeship completions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Turnbull government did last night was to make sure that there was some additional funding attached to the Skilling Australians Fund and to support the states and territories in relation to apprenticeships to address the fact that there had been some revisions in the estimates of what the levy would raise. That is because we are committed to making sure that the promise we gave last year of $1½ billion to support the Skilling Australians Fund will be delivered—and it will be delivered. It's clearly in the budget, and it's still $1.5 billion. Senator Cameron can make up whatever he might like to make up, and I have no doubt—let me make a bold prediction—he will move to take note after question time. I bet we'll get a five-minute diatribe from Senator Cameron, the likes of which we're all used to hearing. Of course, there'll be all the usual class war rhetoric from Senator Cameron and more lies and misinformation. But we are committed to delivering the $1½ billion Skilling Australians Fund to create more apprenticeship opportunities for young Australians.</span>

Senator Cameron tries to dress up alleged cuts as being the types of reform we've made to fix the rorts and rip-offs of Labor's VET FEE-HELP scheme. When we fixed the billions of dollars going out the door every year into the pockets of providers who weren't providing any training and weren't getting any completions but were just ripping off the taxpayer, he was apparently quite happy to claim that it was a cut. No, Senator Cameron, what we put in place through the new VET Student Loans program was the better targeting of taxpayers' dollars so that they only went to reputable providers so that we were only funding courses with high employment outcomes. Ultimately, those providers will be judged not on how much they can rake in from the taxpayer but on whether their students are completing a qualification and getting a job out of it. Our focus is always on ensuring taxpayers' money is used well and that in education and training it leads to skills that lead to jobs.</span>

We make no apologies for the fact that we want to keep spurring investment by Australian businesses, because investment created more than 400,000 jobs in Australia last year. Do you know who gets those jobs? Australian students, when they leave university, when they leave vocational education, when they leave school—more jobs for Australian students from their quality education.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2018-19 Budget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget that we saw last night had that distinct whiff of an election about it. In fact, just about everything about this budget has that odour—that odious odour—of a government desperate to restore its political fortunes through a crass attempt to rebuild its political stocks. It's not about the long-term economic future of Australia; it's about the short-term political interests of the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lead-up to this year's budget we saw—and it has been the case over the last five years, but this year it has been at an accelerated rate—a series of highly selective leaks provided to the media. It was so-called information provided on a selective basis, a misleading picture presented as to what was to be in the budget. These stories were about key infrastructure projects; they were about aged care; they were about taxation matters, either corporate or personal. After many years of austerity, the government was able to assert—in its very selective way—that we're now looking at a situation where the government was investing in the nation once again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, what we saw in the budget was very different, a very different picture entirely. What we saw was anything but a nation-building budget. What we saw, for instance, was that on infrastructure projects there was not one new funding announcement—not one! Every single infrastructure project that the government brought forward in its glossy brochure was about measures that had already been announced and funded by previous allocations. The first tranche of so-called income tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners were there—to operate from 1 July this year, aimed squarely at an election timetable, an election framework—but with no explanation whatsoever as to what the cost of the higher levels of benefit would be. The Prime Minister this morning, on ABC Radio, was not able to come anywhere near providing really basic information about what the cost of these measures would be in the medium term. And today, again, the Leader of the Government in the Senate was not able to provide basic information to this Senate about the cost of the government's corporate taxation arrangements. Yet there's an expectation that this government will call upon the Senate to move immediately to carry these propositions into effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that this is a government that, essentially, is seeking to provide immediate sugar hits in a range of areas without regard to the longer term consequences, and is hoping that it can escape scrutiny and escape any proper attention. If you look at the science and research area, for instance, the government's taking away $2½ billion over four years out of the research and development funding arrangements, but providing only $600 million in terms of additional support. Yet today the education minister talks about a funding package of $1.9 billion. What he forgets to point out is that it's over 12 years. So these sleights of hand are constantly being put forward. What we've got is a rhetorical illusion being presented—an attempt to try to present something that's different from the reality. We've got a Prime Minister who is focused on electoral fortunes, not on the nation's fortunes—a Prime Minister who really is concentrating on trying to revive this government. In fact, this morning's effort, I thought, was an attempt to repair the damage of some of the manic performances of the government's Treasury spokesman on these matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing time and time again is statements, for instance, around these special leaks, provided in very secret circumstances to selected journalists. For instance, look at the space agency. We were told in these special leaks that $50 million would come about for seed funding for an Australian space agency. What's the reality in the budget? $26 million. We see this happening again and again and again. What this budget does is actually lock in cuts. It locks in the $17 billion in cuts to schools, the $700 million in cuts to hospitals, the freezes to the Medicare rebate. It raises the pension age to 70, there is the energy supplement to pensioners and the $80 billion handout in tax cuts to large corporations. This is a test that the government's failed yet again in terms of fairness and in terms of social justice. It really is all about preserving the political interests of the Liberal Party and the National Party rather than the interests of ordinary Australians and defending the long-term interests of Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  I'd like to take note of the ministers' comments, but, first of all, I'd like to congratulate the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance on an outstanding budget that, as the Treasurer said today, is all about the future that not only we will live in; it is the economy that our children will inherit and live with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is the importance of this budget seen more clearly than in the measures for my own home state—and our home state, Senator Cormann—of Western Australia. Clearly, the measures in this budget assist the Western Australian economy to change and adopt new infrastructure and new jobs. The government's plan for a stronger economy will support more jobs for Western Australian families and their children, and it sets up Western Australia for the future in a number of new industries. Already in Western Australia, as a result of these measures, there are 20,200 more people in work since the coalition was elected. Clearly, the unemployment rate in Western Australia is still far too high and we have more work to do. Again, that is work that this budget wholeheartedly endorses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth government is working with Western Australia to provide $9.8 billion of vital infrastructure projects, including $2.8 billion for new major projects such as the $1.1 billion for METRONET, which I'm very glad to see is fully funding the Thornlie to Cockburn rail link, something I've been advocating for a long time, because it's very important to get people in our eastern suburbs to jobs in the south of the city. There is the $944 million Perth congestion package, which includes $581 million for the Tonkin Highway extension to alleviate traffic problems that many of us experience every day. The list goes on and on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to also congratulate and acknowledge the support that this government is providing to Defence in Western Australia. Western Australia continues to play an important part in the defence of our nation, as very clearly outlined in this budget. Very clearly, this government's priority is the safety and security of Australia and its people. Western Australia is already home to nearly 6,000 Defence personnel and to a number of key operational and support bases. Under this budget, Defence will expend over $1.5 billion in the Western Australian economy upgrading these bases. I understand that up to 80 per cent of those contracts that have already been let are going directly to local businesses in Western Australia. So, of 185 infrastructure subcontracts let, with more still to be let under this budget, 88 per cent are, in fact, going to local businesses in Western Australia, which, again, will provide very important jobs for Western Australians to support the defence efforts in Western Australia. These are all important opportunities for local Western Australian businesses, whether it be in Rockingham around Fleet Base West or at our bases in the north. There are now millions of dollars going into our regions, not just into facilities in and around Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is now also commencing work, which has been confirmed in the budget, on final planning for the facilities and infrastructure to be built at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> to support the basing of the two new offshore patrol vessels and also for the creation of 'Ship Zero' as part of the government's regeneration of the Royal Australian Navy. I was very happy to be able to host the Western Australian Labor Minister for Defence Issues here in Canberra yesterday to meet with Christopher Pyne, because work now has to commence on plans for the upgrade of the Henderson facilities not just for the Navy but also for our civilian shipbuilding capabilities and to take advantage of the opportunities Western Australia now has to develop its shipbuilding capability in the commercial sectors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a very productive meeting. Off the back of this budget, at that meeting yesterday the federal and the state government agreed to work together on a master plan for the Henderson region, which the state government is leading with the support of the federal government. Work will also commence together on a plan for Western Australia and the defence industry more generally. Again, none of that would be possible without the provision of the funding in this budget. So I thank Minister Papalia for coming to Canberra yesterday to discuss these important initiatives on how we leverage off this budget to make sure that we provide infrastructure and support for WA industry. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  We're now looking at another budget. Another year's gone by, and the normal process happens. It's not at all surprising that we had the government come in and talk about how great the budget is and all the great things that are going to happen to the community while people who are not in the government raise issues about why things could be done better and how it could be different. But, as I've said many times in this place: it's not just the people who are in this chamber that the government needs to convince about the probity, the integrity and the positive nature of their budget; it's actually the people in the wider community. We've now seen the arguments start. We've seen the media coverage—the pages talking about 'winners' and 'losers' in the budget. And everyone rumbles through the media to try and find out where their particular circumstances are, where they fit, what will happen to them and their families and their futures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's all not as clear as it could be when it first happens because you have to go to the detail, and that's part of the job of this place—to actually look at the detail of the budget, to ask the questions to find out exactly where the costs will be, what the impacts will be and, in fact, what all those pages of explanation and tables mean. That will lead us in a couple of weeks' time to something that many people enjoy—and some people question—the Senate estimates process, which is an invaluable tool that we have in this place to look in great detail at what is happening in various forms of government expenditure. We were asking questions today about the impact on pensioners, about the impact on people who are unemployed, about what is going to happen. The Senate estimates process allows us to get that detail to then share with the public.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk briefly about something that gave me real hope today when I met with two groups of young people who are here to look at what's in the budget, to raise their concerns and talk to parliamentarians about what the budget means—in fact, doing their job in the community and talking about what's important to them. One is the National Union of Students, who have built their own paper around building a better budget. What should the budget be for people who work in universities, who are studying and who are building their futures? What should happen out of this budget process? They're having some trouble finding answers about that in this budget. Nonetheless, they see it as part of their role to continue to raise these questions to ensure that their co-students, the people who rely on universities for employment and the people who are building their plans for the future will not only know about what expenditure is going to be put into the higher education sector—and how curriculum will be affected during the whole schooling process—but also what should be a fair way to provide education in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only this morning, I had the real pleasure of meeting with another group of young people from Micah, who gathered together outside in the cold this morning right beside where all the big people were talking about what was in the budget. They laid out a banquet table on the lawns outside our parliament to show that there is room for everyone at the table, and the way that we spend our budget dollars in this place can be scrutinised to see exactly how that goodwill—how that expenditure—will be shared at the table by everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Micah were particularly raising issues around international development and the future of international development. This year with the budget we had time and opportunity—because many elements of this budget were leaked to the media in the weeks beforehand, it was quite interesting to see what else was going to be in the budget last night. I know only some people actually survived the whole of the Treasurer's speech. It's at the end of the speech that you get all the papers and can see what is really in there. These young people took that opportunity to look at international development in the budget after the budget speech last night. They could not find the increase; they could not find the things in the budget that were going to benefit our people, our neighbours and people across the world who are so vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to take this opportunity in the parliament, through Senate estimates, to raise issues around the budget and to see whether, in fact, the largesse that has been spoken about by the government will be shared with the wider community. We will be able to see who exactly will be the winners and the losers. The hope is that the community will understand effectively who's won and who's lost.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I rise to take note of the answers in question time today, but I do so with great enthusiasm for the work that has been done by the Liberal-National Party government in bringing forward a budget that is going to deliver tax relief for all Australians, encourage and reward working Australians, and reduce the cost pressures that their households face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone faces the price of higher taxes. It weakens the economy across the board. It costs jobs, especially for those who are most vulnerable to poverty. It makes it so much harder for people who are disadvantaged to get into work when we have a weak economy, and that is why this government and its plans so firmly support all Australians to work hard and to get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to see that our team, as a first step, has put together a budget that will deliver tax relief of up to $530 for middle- and low-income earners and that is being delivered right now. The second step is that Australians will have protection for what they earn from the scourge of bracket creep—making sure that when they get a pay rise, when they earn overtime or when they work more hours they get the benefit in their own pockets, rather than having it gobbled up by bracket creep. The third step is that this government is working hard to make sure more Australians pay less tax by making personal income taxes simpler.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best part about all of this is that it is affordable, and the reason it's affordable is that this government has worked so hard to build the economy from the position it was in when it came to government. They have generated so many more jobs. In fact, there are 1,000 or more new jobs created every day in this country now, and that means that we have the lowest number of people receiving welfare from the Commonwealth government that we have seen in 20 years. This is a remarkable achievement. Not only does it reduce the expenses that the Australian people face, but it also means that we have a greater revenue flow. We have more people who not only have the dignity and purpose of work but also are contributing to revenue by paying income tax themselves. This is very exciting, because it frees up this country to invest in its future. I'm particularly excited to see the investments in infrastructure that are being made by this government in Queensland, my home state. This budget is doing so much for Australians, and it is going to keep feeding the economic growth—</span>

                  </a>  I'm so glad to hear that Labor is interested in where this money is coming from. It is quite exciting, because the revenue has increased more and more, as more Australians get into work, because we are committed to building business. We are committed to giving them every reason to invest in more jobs and every reason to build their investment in Australia. And every time that happens we find that more company taxes are paid and more income taxes are paid, and we have the ability to guarantee the essential services that Australians depend upon. It is terribly exciting, and I am so proud to be a part of a team that has achieved so much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In infrastructure, Queensland will benefit economically, and will get home sooner and safer, from the investments that are being made. There will be $3.3 billion in investment into continued upgrades for the Bruce Highway, including $880 million for the Pine River to Caloundra corridor upgrade, $800 million for the Cooroy to Curra section D upgrade and $2 million for additional safety works. That's not all. There's also $1 billion allocated to upgrading the M1—that important artery for the Gold Coast—and $390 million for the Beerburrum to Nambour rail upgrade. There's $300 million for the Brisbane Metro and $170 million for the Cunningham Highway—so much opportunity for this country. We are just so proud to be delivering for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I so want to come into to this chamber and believe what I'm hearing from the other side, because I know that people listening to this and people here in the chamber think they're actually going to get the truth. But we've been hearing this government come in after the budget and do this little dance every single year for the last five years. And every single time, as soon as you start to shine the light on what they tell you they're doing, you actually find out that the truth is very, very different. Once again, we revisit the same old pattern of behaviour from this government, setting out from day one of the budget to deceive the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night this government had the chance to fix five years of unfairness in what I hope will be the very last budget that we see from this government. Sadly, they didn't take up that opportunity. And there is one group that I want to make some comments about. People have read the headlines in recent days about how this government is going to come in and fix up aged care. Right across this country today, as we have this debate in the parliament, 100,000 great Australians are seeking aged-care packages. They were promised in headlines generated by leaks from this government that this was going to be the budget to fix this big problem. But when we look at the detail, what have we got from this government over here, who are excited and proud about what they're doing? We've got 14,000 aged-care packages and a massive waiting list—and to deliver that miserly 14,000 packages they've cut the funding from residential places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a government that cares about aged people in Australia. This is not a government that could care a jot about the impact of needing a level 4 aged-care package and being delivered a level 1 package—because that's what this government is willing to give you as an ageing Australian. No, this government comes in here and it's going to try to force through—and it has already pushed it into the House of Representatives this morning—a plan to dud tens of thousands of Australian aged-care residents in this country who need a bit of help. The government is coming in to dud them and is going to give $80 billion worth of tax cuts to the big companies instead, many of whom don't even pay tax. That's what they want to do. That's their choice. Those are their values. That's what they decided to do last night. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of that $80 billion, let's be clear about where a great big chunk of it's going: $17 billion to the banks of this country, who right now are under the scrutiny—at last—of a royal commission that this government voted against 25 times and held up for two years. The government are cosying up with their mates at the top end of town. Make no mistake: this is not a budget for battlers. This is not a budget that's in the interest of the nation. This is a budget that's in the interest of their big friends at the top end of town. And the great shame of it is that 100,000 ageing Australians and their families, right now, are sitting waiting. And they will continue to wait, because this government simply don't understand their responsibility to look after the vulnerable in our community. That is not their way. They don't stand up for ordinary Australians. They don't care. They care much more about their relationships with the top end of town, and they continue to put out this—I think the term used by Senator Carr this afternoon was—'rhetorical illusion'. This rhetorical illusion tries to hide that, in their budget, anything that looks like something they might have given is spread out over 10 years. They are a government on their last legs. They've got a year, at best, to deliver what they're saying is in the budget. Their promises are out to 10 years! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't trust a single thing they say. Go back to the night before the 2013 election: 'No cuts to the ABC. No cuts to the SBS.' What did we get again last night in this budget? Another $125 million worth of cuts to the ABC. Everywhere you look—on every page in the budget that the government put out last night—you will see falsehoods that simply will not match the rhetoric that we'll get in this place. Anyone who supports what the government are attempting to do to the Australian aged population really deserves to hang their head in shame. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very rare to have a budget that so starkly highlights the choices that are before us as a nation, but this is one of those budgets. This is one of those budgets that puts in very stark relief the choices that face the Australian people right now. What the government has proposed is a seven-year tax plan. Unlike Senator O'Neill, I don't mind governments laying out their long-term vision. I think that's a good thing. Of course, we need to put more value in the positions that they're putting forward that will need to be legislated and budgeted for over the forward estimates. But having an idea about where a government wants to take a nation long-term is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. The problem here is that this is a government that, through its tax package—something that it says needs to be looked at as a whole—is one that not just rewrites the tax rules of this country but remakes the very fabric of Australian society. What the government's proposing here is a radical US-style tax plan. That's what it's proposing—a tax plan that undermines the progressive nature of our tax system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a progressive tax system that says the more you earn, the more you pay in tax and the higher the tax rate will be. And that tax-and-transfer system allows us to achieve a much more egalitarian nation than most. But this plan takes us down the US route. What it says is: 'We're going to have a flat rate of taxation. If you're on 40 grand, if you're a childcare worker, you'll get a tax cut'—that's true—'but you'll get the same tax cut if you're on $200,000.' What that means in practice is that, if you're a politician or a stockbroker, you get an extra $7,000 in your pocket. If you're a childcare worker or a teacher or a nurse, you get a few hundred extra dollars in your pocket. That is a recipe for turbocharging inequality in Australia. We have a problem with growing inequality here, as we do in many other developed nations across the world. The big challenge for us is how do we create a more egalitarian society? How do we create a nation where the gap between the super-rich and everybody else starts to contract? What is being proposed here is something that will turbocharge inequality in Australia. Of course, the only way that tax cuts of this magnitude—whether it be the $65 billion to $80 billion tax cuts proposed for corporate Australia or the $130 billion to $140 billion tax cuts provided for people on super high incomes—are to be achieved is by starving essential services of the funds that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a doctor, I can tell you, when someone is saying 'tax cuts', what they're also saying is: you're going to have to wait longer in the emergency department; if you're on a list to have an elective procedure, that may blow out from a year to two years; if you go and see your GP, that's a recipe for higher out-of-pocket costs; it means more to send your child to get an education; it means no chance of increasing Newstart, which is committing people to a life of poverty; it means we're going to continue to undermine our national broadband network; and it means we won't invest in a world-class public transport system. They are the costs associated with the decisions that are being made by this government. And, of course, all sides like to say, 'We care about people on low- and middle-incomes.' Well, if you are someone on a low income and you are working a few hours a week on the minimum wage, you're not going to get a benefit out of this package. If you're somebody who's on Newstart, you're not going to get a benefit out of this package. If you're a first-year childcare graduate, you won't even get a benefit out of the $40,000 tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a prescription for growing inequality in Australia, and we are going to fight like hell to stop it. What should we be doing? We don't have a tax system in this country; we have a tax avoidance system. How about we close those loopholes for corporate Australia? How about we minimise profit shifting, which is where we see those big multinationals cook the books so they don't pay tax here in Australia. What about those millionaires who are not paying any tax? There are dozens of people on $2 million and $3 million who pay a lot of money to minimise their tax and then pay zero tax. Let's have a Buffett rule for those. What about those mining companies who are reaping mega profits off our coal and gas? Let's have a PRRT that actually gains some revenue. That's the prescription for a fairer, more decent Australia.</span>

Let's be very clear: this is a stunt by the Greens political party. It's nothing but symbolic. Nothing in the motion being debated today will address the huge issues the government has created through its lazy robodebt scam. If the Greens political party really wanted to do something to address unfair Centrelink debts then this is what they would be focusing on. This is our focus, so we will oppose the motion today and continue to concentrate on proper policy developments to address inequality in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I introduce the Criminal Code and Other Legislation Amendment (Removing Commonwealth Restrictions on Cannabis) Bill 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Adults should be free to make their own choices, as long as they do not harm others.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly, this Bill removes offences and civil penalty provisions in Commonwealth law for dealings with cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span>. It prevents cannabis, including any product obtained from a cannabis plant, from being defined as a controlled or border controlled drug. In so doing the Bill excludes dealings with cannabis from the serious drug offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. For completeness, the Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Regulations 2002</span> so that cannabis and tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) are no longer listed as controlled and border controlled drugs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990</span>. It removes cannabis and THC from the Act's definition of narcotic drug, and removes dealings in cannabis and THC from the Act's definition of dealing in drugs. Together this serves to remove dealings with cannabis from the Act's offence provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence Force Discipline Act 1982</span> to remove what will be redundant references to cannabis, while maintaining the existing disciplinary consequences for dealings with other drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narcotic Drugs Act 1967</span>. It repeals Chapter 2 of the Act, which establishes medicinal cannabis licences and imposes offences and civil penalties for dealings with cannabis that are not authorised by such licences. The Bill also amends Chapter 3 of the Act, which establishes drug manufacture licences and imposes offences and civil penalty provisions for dealings with drugs that are not authorised by such licences. Chapter 3 is amended so these licences and the associated offences and civil penalty provisions do not apply with respect to dealings with cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989</span> so that the Poisons Standard established by the Act does not apply in relation to cannabis. This will be consistent with the non-application of the Poisons Standard to nicotine in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking. It will also ensure that the Act cannot be used as a vehicle to ban cannabis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill commences a year after Royal Assent, allowing time for state and territory governments to choose to maintain or alter their own laws relating to cannabis. They may maintain their bans on cannabis, with exemptions for medicinal use, if they choose. Alternatively, they may legislate to allow broader use and to regulate with respect to various matters such as children and driving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill does not introduce a cannabis tax. Existing alcohol and tobacco taxes are not sound policy and should not be replicated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This national endeavour is the most significant nation building project Australia has ever undertaken. Larger and more complex than the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme and the National Broadband Network, the Naval Shipbuilding Plan that the government is delivering will engage all states and territories through their contributions to naval shipbuilding and sustainment of both current and future naval vessels, or as contributors to industry supply chains, or providers of national workforce development and skilling to meet the growing need for skilled naval shipbuilding workers across the sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Centre Alliance is fully supportive of the Federal Government's $90 billion continuous Naval Shipbuilding program, but a significant change in approach is required in the interests of our national security and to maximise the economic benefit of the program to Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is very deliberately designed to counter the approach taken by the Defence Department's procurement bureaucrats in the Future Frigate program whereby Australia's two established and highly capable shipbuilders, ASC and Austal, have been excluded in the tender documents from having responsibility for the build. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead the Government has invited three foreign ship designers to bid for the job, offering them a taxpayer-funded shipyard in Adelaide and a $35 billion contract to establish themselves to compete with the long standing Australian companies. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the bureaucrats advising Government are determined to see the quiet death of a sovereign shipbuilding capability in Australia and its replacement with foreign entities operating on Australian waterfront real estate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is hard to imagine how the Government imagines Australia will develop a sovereign shipbuilding capability with our future submarines being built by the French company, Naval Group (formerly DCNS), and now our future frigates being built by a British, an Italian or a Spanish company. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This point has been made by Austal's chief executive, David Singleton, who has observed that:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we need to work on creating an industry that stands on its own two feet, free of government subsidy. We cannot afford for the naval shipbuilding industry to be addicted to government welfare for its survival. The key lies in exports and the key to exports lies in Australian companies owning the intellectual property behind every ship they build. The ability to conceive new ship designs, develop them and build them in Australia needs to be a clear focus of the future Australian shipbuilding industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is absolutely vital that through our very large investment in submarines, frigates and patrol boats, the Federal Government secures the intellectual knowledge in the minds of Australians, resident in Australia and working in Australian companies, so that we have the capacity to design new ships for ourselves and for our export markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet the Government's approach is to see foreign companies take the lead in these nationally significant programs; foreign companies that will control the programs, foreign companies that will install their own management teams in Adelaide and elsewhere, foreign companies that will control the intellectual property and determine our shipyards' strategic direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When an export opportunity arises, it won't be for the Australian shipbuilder and shipyard to determine if we can export; the decision will be made in the context of the corporate plans of executives in Paris, Rome, Madrid or London. These will be decisions that will be made on the basis of the global commercial perspectives of those companies without Australian government consultation or control. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's decisions to implement our naval construction programs in this way have been fundamentally flawed. This has to stop, and it has to stop now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consequently, the Bill contains a provision that will mean the law applies from the date it was announced—as has been done for other Government bills. This will have effect on both the Future Submarine Program, for which no build contract has yet been signed, and the Future Frigate Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to the specific provisions of the Bill, these will apply only to agreements by the Commonwealth for building new vessels intended for use by the Royal Australian Navy, and do not apply more generally to government vessels. However, this Bill does not prohibit the Government from choosing an Australian shipbuilder for other government vessels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill only applies to vessels of over 30 metres in length. The length overall of 30 metres will cover all major vessels for the Navy including patrol boats similar to the Pacific class patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, submarines, supply ships, and auxiliaries, but will exclude smaller vessels such as launches, rigid-hulled inflatable boats, lifeboats, small landing craft and barges.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill specifies that the Commonwealth may only enter into an agreement for the building of a vessel intended for use by the Navy with an entity that is incorporated in Australia, and that is not a subsidiary of a foreign entity, nor controlled by foreign persons within the meaning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975</span>. This is to ensure that Australian naval construction will only be undertaken by Australian shipbuilders incorporated in Australia and under the control of Australians. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will not prevent foreign shipbuilders tendering to be the prime contractor in any shipbuilding program, but they will need to sub-contract the entire build to an Australian-controlled shipbuilder that meets minimum experience and performance thresholds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is consistent with the provisions of Australia's free trade agreement obligations which exclude much national security-related procurement from their non-discriminatory provisions, including procurement of naval vessels, small craft, pontoons and floating docks, as well as naval marine equipment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides that an agreement for the building of a vessel intended for use by the Navy must provide for the provision, grant or conferral by the entity, or the Australian shipbuilder, to the Commonwealth of intellectual property rights relating to the vessel for the purposes of maintaining, repairing or modifying the vessel. This provision ensures that the Commonwealth will retain the ability to ensure ongoing maintenance, repair or modification of Navy vessels in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill requires that the Commonwealth must be satisfied that the Australian shipbuilder has demonstrated its capability to deliver an ongoing shipbuilding or upgrading program and to build or deliver major upgrades to vessels intended for use by the Navy, and demonstrates international competitiveness, compliance with relevant industry standards, and financial viability. These conditions are consistent with the standards that have already been applied to Australian shipbuilders engaged in major naval shipbuilding programs for the Commonwealth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The effect of these provisions will be to ensure the know-how from major taxpayer-funded naval construction programs is transferred to Australian-controlled companies, not to subsidiary companies of foreign entities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian shipbuilders will be able to assure export customers that they have the confidence of their own Navy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Bill will allow overseas procurement of naval vessels in time of a defence emergency or war, it will provide an unambiguous legislative direction that Australian naval construction must take place in Australia by Australian companies with the consequent benefits for our defence industrial base and long-term strategic self-reliance.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nearly one hundred and ten years ago the then Prime Ministers Alfred Deakin and Andrew Fisher committed the funds and signed the contracts for the acquisition of the first vessels for the Royal Australian Navy. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Contrary to the wishes of some who argued that the Navy's new ships should be built at the cheapest possible price in British shipyards, the Deakin and Fisher Governments took a different path. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While those early contracts provided for the purchase of a number of vessels from British shipbuilders, they were also designed to lay the foundations for naval construction in Australia by specifying that one of Australia's new ships, a torpedo boat destroyer, HMAS<span style="font-style:italic;"> Warrengo</span>, would be assembled not in the United Kingdom but at the Cockatoo Island dockyard in Sydney, thereby ensuring the transfer of new shipbuilding skills and capabilities to Australia. </span>

                    </a>  The original three motions from Senators Wong and Collins today relate to over 1,000 questions addressed to 11 ministers and 11 portfolios and would involve 14 government departments and other portfolio agencies. The government receives a large number of questions on notice in this place, in the other place and in parliamentary committees. Ministers, with the support of their departments, seek to answer questions as soon as practicable. Sometimes, particularly with complex questions which involve departments and agencies assembling a large amount of information, the time limits are not able to be met. The terms of these motions, if agreed to, would allow less than one working day to finalise answers to questions. To attempt to fully comply with the terms of these motions would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources for the government departments involved. Nevertheless, ministers will seek to lodge answers to as many of these questions as they can as soon as practicable.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I introduce to the senate the Treasury Laws Amendment (Axe the Tampon Tax) Bill 2018,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which seeks to remove the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from sanitary products. Sanitary products are defined in the Bill as tampons, pads, liners, cups, sponges and other products used in connection with menstruation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the <span style="font-style:italic;">A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999</span> came into effect in 2000, people who menstruate have been paying tax on sanitary products. While items like sunscreen, folic acid and personal lubrication are exempt from GST as health products, sanitary items are not. Sanitary products are essential for millions of Australians to maintain health and hygiene connected with the cycle of menstruation. They are no less pertinent to the maintenance of personal and public health than the exempt items, therefore the justification for sanitary items attracting GST is flawed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If it were cisgender men who required sanitary products in relation to a natural function of their bodies every month, it is unlikely that the GST would have been added in the same manner. The current Act amounts to a tax on the biology of people who menstruate and it never should have existed in the first place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From the very beginning there has been strong opposition from the public about the decision to apply GST to sanitary products. There have been protests here at Parliament House in Canberra, and at universities and in cities around the country. For over 17 years people have been protesting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first petition to this parliament opposing the GST on sanitary items was tabled here in this place on 15 February 2000, with 10,355 signatures calling on the Government to make tampons and sanitary pads GST-free. Since then, there have been countless similar petitions started by individuals, community groups, university groups, charities and political parties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The justification for keeping the tax on sanitary products that has been put forward by both Labor and Coalition is to say that it would be impossible to make the change without the support of the states and territories who are the recipients of GST revenue. It is certainly not impossible. It is a change that can be enacted by the Federal Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The engagement and input of the states and territories is however important for this issue, which is why I have written to state and territory treasurers to urge their support for removing this unfair tax. We know that a number of the states already support this reform. I commend this bill to the senate, as a way to demonstrate the national leadership and action that is required to finally fix this matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's worth noting that the money the states currently receive from the tax on sanitary items represents only about 0.05% of the total GST revenue they will collect this financial year. This should not be seen as a genuine obstruction to changing in the Act. The legislation to impose the GST on sanitary items was made federally, and the federal parliament can lead the way and fix it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For state, territory and federal budgets this tax is a drop in the ocean. The impacts of the GST on sanitary products are actually felt by people who need to purchase the products. This tax disproportionately affects low income women and transgender people, many of whom have insecure work and housing. It's easy for some to dismiss this as a non-issue. But there are people who are sometimes faced with having to make a choice between buying tampons or buying food. The fact that they're charged more for an essential sanitary product because of the GST is unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens support the removal of this discrimination, and we want to see this matter addressed as soon as possible by the Parliament. I am introducing this bill on behalf of every person who has signed a petition, attended a protest, written to their MP, or felt the financial burden of this unfair tax. This reform is long overdue. </span>
                </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise to put on the record my continuing concern at the deception that this government inflicts upon the Australian people with regard to their intentions with this budget. They try to dress it up as a budget for battlers—a budget for ordinary, hardworking Australians—when in reality this is a budget that seeks to continue their cosy arrangement with the top end of town and delivers big, big business benefits to the banks: $80 billion in a tax handout, $17 billion of which goes to the four big banks, which are the subject of the great work that's being done right now by the royal commission that the government continued to oppose for two years after Labor called for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we have seen—and I have had the chance to participate in a short debate about this following question time today—the words of the government Senator Carr described today as: 'rhetorical illusion'. That's what they're practised at: rhetorical illusion. They're pretending that they're doing something and speaking as if they're doing something, when in fact they are not doing anything of benefit to the practical realities of ordinary, hardworking Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record the impact—or, sadly, the lack of response—to the needs of the people on the great Central Coast, where I live. There is no better example of the problems with this budget than the government's complete failure to deliver for the people of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast. I think the most potent example of this budget's unfair intent is the lack of any new infrastructure money for roads or rail on the Central Coast. This is a pressing issue. Ask any coastie about the state of local roads and they'll tell you that their roads are the worst in New South Wales, especially in the area of the peninsula. Yet we have the local member, Ms Lucy Wicks, taking out full-page ads in the paper after five years, asking people to identify a road that has a problem. If, after five years in the parliament and driving around the Central Coast, Ms Wicks hasn't figured out that we need some road funding, it's a bit late now to be asking the community to identify the problems that she should have known about a long time ago. And it's even later today than it was yesterday, because there was no money in the budget for it, anyway. Not a single dollar in the budget is devoted to fixing a single road in Umina, Terrigal, Avoca, Macmasters Beach, Woy Woy, Bensville, Kincumber, Springfield or Gosford. All of them miss out. There is not a single dollar devoted to fixing the drainage or the kerbing or to building the pedestrian pathways that are so important to people on the Central Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the government's own budget papers, they've decided that they want to fix something that matters to them. In addition to giving the $80 billion tax cut to big business and $17 billion to the banks, they've decided that they should invest $26 million in upgrading the Prime Minister's own department. But there is no money to upgrade infrastructure on the Central Coast—zero dollars for roads in Robertson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also no investment in TAFE or job creation on the coast, despite our ongoing unemployment crisis and a doubling of young people's unemployment to over 17 per cent. Since Ms Wicks was elected in 2013 our unemployment rate has skyrocketed, higher than the state average; youth unemployment has doubled; enrolments in local TAFE have dropped by 63 per cent; and 120 TAFE jobs have been cut. This is a disaster for the people of the Central Coast, for young people and their families. This budget demonstrates that Ms Wicks, the current member for Robertson, under this Turnbull government, has absolutely given up on job creation and the fight to fix our local unemployment crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning—this very morning—Ms Wicks was patting herself on the back for recycling another laundry list of broken promises that were reprinted in last night's budget. She promised $10 million to help deliver Gosford's long awaited world-class regional performing arts and cultural centre. She promised that in 2013. It's still not delivered. Three budgets ago she promised $7 million towards what was supposed to be an innovation centre. Now she's calling it a regional library. It's $7 million that hasn't been delivered since 2013, and now she's changing the purpose of it. Ms Wicks made another commitment in 2013: continuous mobile coverage on the trains and a New South Wales government business case to investigate faster rail to deliver for our hardworking communities. They are all on the never-never. They're typical of what's going on in this budget, which is for the big end of town and which negatively impacts the lives of Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FAWCETT:</span>
                  </a>  Senators opposite laugh, but it's no laughing matter when we have record jobs growth in terms of the number of people who have been employed—over 420,000 jobs over the last year, the vast majority of which have been full-time. People criticise that. I've seen some comments saying, 'Ah, yes, but surely there must be jobs lost as well, so the net effect is not good,' but the other fact that is really important to note is that the number of Australians who are on welfare, whose homes depend on welfare, is at its lowest level in 25 years. What that means is that this government not only has been successful in creating the environment where businesses are prepared to invest and create more opportunities but has translated that in real terms to businesses being prepared to employ people, and the very best form of welfare that a person and a family and a home can possibly have is somebody in work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing Australians working in record numbers. That's reflected also in the strong economy in terms of the income from taxation. Some people say, 'Surely, that means you're taxing more.' No. What it means is, with fewer people on welfare and more people in work, there are more people contributing to our economic wellbeing as opposed to drawing from it in the safety net that is welfare. That's why the government has been able to make significant investments in other areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia, for example, public hospitals will receive $7.9 billion over the next five years. Compared to the five years before that, that's an additional $1.31 billion—a 20 per cent increase. That is so important in South Australia as we see the newly elected Marshall government seeking to recover the disastrous planning and construction of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. In the last couple of weeks we've seen documents revealed showing that unions and medical professionals had sought to have input into the design and the construction of that hospital but had been shut out by previous governments that were intent on closing down medical services around the state and centralising them in Adelaide. They even got the new Royal Adelaide Hospital wrong, which was the pinnacle of their investment. The federal government's ability to help state governments and my own state of South Australia by providing adequate funding for hospitals is an example of the kinds of things that you can do when you have a strong economy. You don't have a strong economy by taxing the people who generate wealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The progressive tax system that we have brought in, which is providing tax relief to families, is a fair system. It means that those with the lowest income are receiving tax relief in the order of eight per cent. They will receive that as of 1 July this year. That will come into effect if senators in this place vote for those measures. People on higher incomes receive much smaller tax relief, around 0.2 per cent. In some of the middle brackets it is two per cent, and for those on low incomes it is up to eight per cent. That's a system that encourages people to work. It encourages Australians in work, who are delivering a strong economy to Australia, and particularly the small businesses who are providing the employment. In the federal electorate of Makin in my home state of South Australia, for example, there are some 11½ thousand small businesses. They will benefit from the extension of the write-off that's available for small businesses buying capital equipment, and other measures that are looking to help them to grow their businesses and to employ more Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-of-living pressures that people are facing—and they are significant—will be coming down as a result of the investments that this government is making and as a result of the constructive relationships we are seeking to build with state governments to get them on board with things like the National Energy Guarantee, which will for the first time start providing price signals to the market around dispatchability and reliability in conjunction with things like our measures around gas. We're already seeing the price for gas reducing. Therefore, the spot price is reducing and the cost for electricity will start coming down. The forecasts are significant. This government is building a stronger economy because the things that Australians care about—jobs, services, education and health—rely on a coalition government building our economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I might take up where Senator Fawcett finished off, on the things that Australians care about. Budgets are a really important opportunity for a government to not only outline its vision and its plan for the future of this nation but also what it prioritises and what its values are. If you look at this budget and you ask yourself whether you share the same values as this government, also ask yourself: what are the great challenges of our time and the great crises that we're facing? What do you want the government to do for you in your life?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens, and I think many Australians, deeply care about the climate crisis that this nation and this planet are facing. There is nothing in this budget for tackling dangerous climate change. In fact, over forward estimates, funding around climate change has been slashed. There was a bandaid package around the Great Barrier Reef, which we know is not going to fix the 50 per cent of the reef that has now died through coral bleaching because of global warming and warming ocean temperatures. We're seeing a species extinction crisis in this country. Yet there's no funding to deal with the loss of biodiversity in this country, which is a national shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other great challenge of our time is rising inequality. What has this budget done to tackle rising inequality? Not only has it done nothing but it's a plan and a vision, which reflects this government's values, to lock in inequality—indeed, to accelerate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important tools that we have in the toolbox in this place as a government, and one of the most important weapons we've got against rising inequality, is our tax system. Under a progressive tax system, which this country has had in place for some time now, higher income earners pay a higher rate of tax because they can afford to. That's the simple principle of fairness and equity that's embedded in our tax system. The budget plan last night was nothing short of a frontal assault on this fair and progressive tax system, a frontal assault on a fair go for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants to bring in a flat tax structure, a US-style tax structure, that we know will only lock in and increase inequality in this country. This budget might have been fine, if you're a millionaire or someone who earns over $200,000, because you'd get an extra $7,000 a year in tax cuts, if this government gets its way. But what about those Australians who are struggling to get work. Part-time workers, workers on the minimum wage, the unemployed and those on Newstart get nothing at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, this budget shows you what this government prioritises. It shows you what its values are and what it cares about. It doesn't care about climate change, in tackling the great crisis of our time. It doesn't care about inequality or the battlers in this country. The only things it cares about, first and foremost, are votes and power to make sure it stays in power. This is a desperate pitch to get votes. It's an unaffordable plan. It's a vision and a pathway that we do not want to see this country going down. There's so much more we could do to tackle inequality, if we just had the backbone to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also cares about big corporations and their rich mates. There's nothing in here to tax. It's a rigged system—rigged by some of the biggest, wealthiest and most powerful corporations on this planet. There is nothing to fix the petroleum resource rent tax rort. We could have brought in tens of billions of dollars, if we had gotten these companies to pay for the gas that they've extracted—gas and resources owned by the Australian people. There are $240 billion in tax credits sitting there and rising every day, because this government won't fix a broken tax system. There was virtually nothing to tackle multinational tax avoidance across the board. This is a desperate pitch for votes. I hope the Australian people realise that their whole tax system and the fundamental principles of a fair go for all Australians are at risk here, if this plan succeeds. The Greens will fight this plan to the next election. We'll stand up for battlers in Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  This is a budget designed to do one thing, and that is to try to get this government back into power after the next election. It's got nothing much to do with good economics. As Senator Whish-Wilson has identified, it's a budget that simply works off the back of a global economic upturn. It's got nothing to do with any great economic expertise by this government, because they've proven they don't have it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard so much about their plan. Well, look at the plans that this government have had over the last period of time—nearly five years—they've been in government. They had a plan which was about austerity: attacking pensioners, attacking the vulnerable and attacking the weakest in our community. It was about making sure that their mates got looked after. It was about trying to attack welfare recipients. That was their first attempt at a plan—an austerity budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you remember Senator Cormann sitting there with a big, fat Havana cigar, celebrating cutting back on family tax benefits and every benefit that working-class people in this country had. That's what Senator Cormann did. He got out the bottle of wine and the big, fat Havana cigar and celebrated it. And what did the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister went on radio and said he supported every aspect of the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what the coalition are really about—that is, attacking the poorest, attacking the underprivileged, attacking the weakest people in our country and looking after their big business mates. That was the first plan. The second plan was to make changes to the capital gains tax, and that plan, I think, lasted about one week. Then it was about giving the states taxing powers. I think that lasted a couple of days. So there are three plans that have come and gone, but the first plan is still there because that's what they really want to do—look after their big business mates and attack the vulnerable in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this plan, trickle-down economics, doesn't work. The government have done this because the people that actually put the money into their election coffers at elections—the Business Council of Australia, the big banks, the finance corporations—are the ones who want this because they'll get $80 billion at least. And you saw Senator Cormann here today—absolutely incapable of telling us what the real cost of this will be over the 10-year period they talk about, running away from the cost that this will deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that have no economic credibility. They are still cutting the pension by $14 a fortnight, taking the energy supplement off pensioners in this country and giving an $80 billion handout to big business. Retirement at 70 is all right if you're sitting over on the other side as a senator, with your pants getting shiny-arsed. That's okay but, if you do what I did—work as a maintenance fitter in heavy engineering at Liddell power station—at 70 years old, you can't crawl into a confined space and work all day. You can't have a 14-pound hammer and be hanging off the end of that all day. They just don't get it. And the tax cuts—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Hume:</span>
                  </a>  I thought you were a board director of a super fund.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CAMERON:</span>
                  </a>  Here we've got Senator Hume interjecting—someone who has actually worked in the finance sector and would know much about the finance sector—and supporting the cuts to her mates in the finance sector. You know, it's all right for Senator Hume sitting here on $200,000 a year and ending up with a $6,600 tax cut. It's all right for Senator Hume to be interjecting and saying to ordinary workers, the working class in this country: you've got to stick with 550 bucks a year; by the way, we don't support you having any penalty rates; by the way, we would like to cut family tax benefits from you; by the way, when you're a pensioner, you'll work until you're 70; and, by the way, we really want to change indexation on your pension so that you lose $80 a week. That's what Senator Hume would like to do. She's now being challenged by the real right wing in Victoria because she is not right-wing enough. So it's all right for Senator Hume on $200,000 a year to come in here and defend an $80 billion tax cut to big business.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the performance from Senator Birmingham today. Senator Birmingham actually called me a liar three times, said I was a class warrior. Well, if standing up for the working class in this country makes me a class warrior, I will take that any day because I do want to look after working-class people in this country. And what Senator Birmingham has done—a failed education minister, cutting $17 billion out of schools—is cut another $270 million out of funding for the apprenticeship system in this country, on top of the $3 billion he cut out previously. This is a minister who has failed in his portfolio, who called me a liar three times and said no $270 million was being cut out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me take you back to the budget papers in 2017. The budget papers then were clear that there would be $1.5 billion for the Skilling Australians Fund. The budget papers this year say in Budget Paper 1, part 5-14: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Another component of other taxes is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Skilling Australians Fund</span> levy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So they recognise it is a tax that they're putting on. It continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since the 2017-18 MYEFO, <span style="font-style:italic;">Skilling Australians Fund</span> levy receipts are forecast to be $465 million lower over the four years to 2021-22. This reflects the measure to expand the Levy refund and exemption provisions, delays in the passage of enabling legislation, as well as decreased demand for temporary work visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a mob that wants to fund the apprenticeship system and the traineeship system in this country solely through the visa system. When they announced this 12 months ago, Labor said, 'This won't work, because there is no guaranteed funding through to deliver what's needed.' Now they've had to concede that. Now their fund is down and the fund will now be $1.2 billion. For Senator Birmingham's education, that is in 2018-19 Budget Paper No. 2 on page 90. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">State and Territory governments will be offered a new agreement which is estimated to provide $1.2 billion over the four years to 30 June 2022. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget cuts funding for apprenticeships. We asked how many apprentices would not be employed now because of these cuts—and remember this $270 million the government cut was supposed to be matched by the states. So it is $540 million out of apprenticeships. This is the mob that has destroyed the TAFE system. This is the mob that doesn't understand basic economics. This mob, this rabble of a government, has had so many plans. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> says, 'What a great plan this is.' Well, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>has said that after every budget this government has brought down, and this government has failed in every budget to deliver proper, reasonable approaches to working-class Australians. It is a disgrace. Its time is up. This is a decaying, dying government; the sooner it kicks the bucket, the better.</span>

I almost feel like I should give you an opportunity to withdraw this matter of public importance or at least rephrase it. Forgive my impertinence, but did you submit it yesterday before the budget was brought down? I can't believe that you could possibly have read the budget or heard it or listened to it. Did the papers not land on your desk last night? Did you not read them? Did you not listen to the Treasurer when he outlined the details of budget repair and a return to surplus a year earlier than anticipated and improved economic conditions, which I might remind you are certainly no accident. They are the result of prudent economic management. Did you not listen to the Treasurer when he detailed lower, simpler and fairer personal taxes, short-term relief and long-term vision for the removal of the disincentives of bracket creep? Did you not listen to the Treasurer last night when he detailed a laser focus on the important essential services of aged care, life-transforming medicines, medical research and mental health? Did you not listen to the Treasurer last night when he spoke of the details of congestion-busting infrastructure projects that our cities so desperately need? </span>

Or did you not read the newspapers or the commentators today? I realise that as of today, because of that pesky section 44 of the Constitution, your ranks and resources are severely depleted, but surely that is no excuse for not understanding the budget or for deliberately misrepresenting it. In this case, if it's simply an oversight, I can assume it is only an oversight and not the opposition being deliberately obtuse. You have certainly given the government a terrific opportunity to enlighten the Senate about the true nature of the coalition's budget for 2018.</span>

                  </a>  Last night my very good friend and colleague the honourable Treasurer Scott Morrison, in the other place, delivered a budget that promised lower taxes, spending on essential services, guaranteeing essential services, and a budget surplus that is well within our grasp and that arrives one year earlier than anticipated. Make no mistake, though, this is absolutely no accident. This is the delivery of a promise, a promise of economic growth, a promise of more jobs and a promise to keep Australians safe. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is the furthest thing from unfair. It's a budget that looks after those who need it the most. It is immediate tax relief for low- and middle-income earners: 4.4 million people who will benefit from a fairer tax system immediately, 4.4 low- and middle-income earners who will keep more of the money they have worked so hard to earn. These are the people who need it the most. The reason this tax relief means so much to those people is very simple. The marginal propensity to consume is almost 100 per cent for low- to middle-income earners.</span>

We must keep backing businesses to invest and create more jobs, especially small and medium enterprises, by lowering the cost of doing business and lowering the cost of company tax. That is fair. We must guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on—like Medicare, like hospitals, like schools and, most importantly, like caring for older Australians—because that is fair.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  This is not a fair budget. It is not helping those most in need. It is a complete fraud on the Australian nation for the government to claim that this is a fair budget and that they're helping low-income Australians. Look at what they're actually doing, how that money is being spent and where that money is going—in other words, the big end of town. If you're earning $200,000, you're fine: out of this budget, you're going to make $7,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what is not fair: it is not fair that the people on the lowest incomes, those struggling to survive on Newstart and youth allowance, are not getting anything. There is no increase in Newstart. There is no increase in youth allowance. The government should've focused their budget on helping those people who are genuinely on the lowest incomes, who are struggling to survive on less than $40 a day—less than $40 a day! I note that some on the other side of this chamber claim they can live on that amount. If you can live on that, try it—try it properly. I have tried it, and it is virtually impossible. When I tried it, it was less than $38 a day. It is impossible to live on when you take out the cost of accommodation, and it's very hard to find affordable accommodation and when you take out all of the other expenses—absolutely essential services, such as your energy, water and available communications, because you have to have a phone to be able to find a job. That is where the government should have been focusing their attention, but, no, they didn't do that because they're still in the land of lifters and leaners—and that is quite clear from this budget. It is quite clear. They don't call them lifters and leaners anymore, but they're still into vilifying and demonising those who are trying to survive on Newstart and youth allowance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it very strange that I am quoting John Howard when it comes to income support—when everybody in this place knows my absolute rejection of Welfare to Work that has so significantly impacted those on Newstart and, particularly, single parents who are worse off now that they're having to survive on the appallingly low Newstart allowance while they're trying to raise their kids. Even John Howard said today that Newstart needs to be increased. Even John Howard, the architect of Welfare to Work, is now saying Newstart has to be increased.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And why would the government listen to academics who are actually quoting the evidence and doing the research that shows that Newstart is so dismal and needs to be increased by at least $75 a week? That doesn't bring it up to the aged-care payment, by the way, which everybody also acknowledges is too low. And then I hear them say, 'But that's because they have to live on it all the time'. People on Newstart have to survive on it for a much longer period than they used to before for a whole variety of reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did the government not raise Newstart; they didn't even enable them to access the same sort of increase in the work bonus as those on the age pension—an increase in the threshold in which you can work before you lose Newstart. They only did that for those on the age pension. That is good for people on the age pension, but where is it for the people trying to survive on the disability support pension? Where is it for the people trying to survive on Newstart? Where is it for those single parents who have kids at home, and who are trying to raise their kids on the appallingly low Newstart? You couldn't even do that. You couldn't even give them that little filler to let them earn just a little bit more before the cut-off to Newstart comes in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, to add insult the injury, all those positive reforms that the government was promising to do to the CDP—the Community Development Program—have been thrown out. From what they said, there's no mention of community wages anymore. Yet, Minister Scullion was at Garma in July promising reform to CDP, including community wages. They're trying to put them onto demerit points through this budget—with people, again, trying to survive on income support in remote communities under the appalling CDP. The government have now made that program worse.</span>

                  <a href="SR5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance raised by my colleague Senator O'Neill. The budget plans to give an $80 million tax handout to big business, but there is no commitment to addressing the needs of First Nations peoples inherent in Closing the Gap. There is no fiscal commitment for remote housing in the states of South Australia, Queensland or my own home state of Western Australia. This is a slash of $1.5 billion over four years to these states. The consequences for health, education, employment and family safety will be devastating. To reduce family violence, you must reduce overcrowding. The whole sense of this as an imperative to dealing with the Closing the Gap strategy is highlighted by this neglect. It is an absolute indictment on the Turnbull government for not pursuing this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet again, millions of dollars will be lost to Western Australia, especially in the remote regions, with no Commonwealth commitment to build and maintain houses in our communities. Good progress was being made under the national partnership, particularly in Queensland, where the delivery of homes was taking place, employment was increasing, apprenticeships were being undertaken and small businesses were being achieved. All of this is placed at risk because there is no agreement and there are no outlays being made or committed to by this government to the state of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no vision, as we have heard from Senator Siewert, on the reform of the CDP, the Community Development Program. There may be an improvement for 6,000 people on a new wage subsidy, but the reform does nothing for the 30,000 mostly First Nations peoples who are subject to the scheme. Penalties are still inbuilt in the reduced hours. The poor will be trapped in poverty and will be punished as a consequence of that poverty and for their noncompliance with the drastic rules that the scheme promotes. The cut of $5 million in the 2014 budget has not been restored. The failure of the IAS program remains, and it seems from the budget documents that some $30 million has been cut over the 2018 year from the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. This will have severe consequences for legal services. It is not clear which of the services will have the responsibility, in addition to the work that they have now, to deal with the civil matters as well as criminal matters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget sends a message to First Nations peoples that we are, in fact, a dying race, worthy only of support in aged care, in suicide prevention and in poor health. It is good that there is new assistance for patients needing renal care and dialysis. But what good is that if you do not have a house to return to? Supply Nation may create some opportunities for selected organisations and Aboriginal businesses; however, there's no clarity about the governance, the employment and the training commitments of those organisations. This budget for First Nations, is for me—listening to the hype that has been around in this chamber—like being a stolen generation child in a foster home on Christmas night, watching the natural children of the foster parents getting all of the presents while the stolen generation child gets to pick up the wrappers. We await the minister entering and putting coloured balloons on the tree, so that we can clap. We are left out, forgotten, neglected and ignored. The government needs to redress this if we are going to do something that provides justice for the First Nations peoples.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  Well, it's an interesting debate, as always. The Labor Party and the Greens continue to lie about the impact of the budget, whereas I and, indeed, most Australians are very, very happy with the budget—because, to me, the big thing is that for the first time in almost a decade the government is now living within its means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of my constituents in Queensland, if they're in business or they have a family budget, know that they have to make their budget work. They have to balance the bottom line and they can't spend more than they earn. Families know that. Businesses know that. Why doesn't the government know that? For the first time in almost a decade, this government is doing that. Not only are we now living within our means but the deficit has come right down. It'll come down further next year, and the following year there will be a $2.2 billion surplus. I've been here a long time. I used to sit here and listen to Wayne Swan promise a surplus in every budget, and not once did he get a surplus. In fact, every year the deficit went up. We've committed since we've been in government to bring the deficit down, and we are on track for a surplus in a couple of years. That, to me, is the big thing. Once we get into surplus, we can start putting money aside and we can start paying off the $400 billion to $500 billion debt run up by the six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. That's the exciting thing for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that interests me is the tax cuts. Excuse me, I'll be a bit parochial about Queensland and I'll talk about North Queensland and about the electorates of Herbert and Kennedy, which I look after because they don't have members that have any interest in the people in those areas. I heard the member for Herbert and the member for Kennedy both saying, 'Oh, there's nothing in this for Kennedy; there's nothing in this for Herbert.' Well, I say to the member for Herbert: go and ask the almost 70,000 taxpayers in your electorate—that's almost three-quarters of the voters in your electorate—if they got nothing out of the budget. They will tell you, because you seem to be too incapable of understanding, that they are going to get real tax cuts, real money in their pockets, starting on 1 July this year. In Kennedy, there are almost 60,000 taxpayers, whom Mr Katter obviously has no connection with, who will benefit from this budget. In addition to that, older people will now get increased aged-care packages to stay at home. There will be new places in aged care. In Townsville, the garrison city, I'm very excited about the support for the veterans community. Apparently the member for Herbert, following the Labor mantra and the talking points that come out and say, 'Just criticise everything,' doesn't realise that the Defence community do well. In the north generally, the chaplaincy program is only a little program but is very well received in the north, and the schools up there will be delighted to see that this chaplaincy program is now becoming permanent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Road funding in the north, and across the board in Queensland, continues to increase. If there's one problem I have with the road funding, it is that I live in Ayr, which is about 100 kilometres south of my office in Townsville, and it very often takes me longer than it should to get from Ayr to Townsville because there is so much roadwork happening. When I drove to Brisbane at Christmas time, it was the same story. There is so much roadwork happening under the coalition government that there are disruptions, but they are building safer and better roads for which the Commonwealth is responsible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are hundreds of other initiatives in the budget. The 10 minutes that I have wouldn't allow me to go anywhere near all of them, but I want to respond to some of the previous contributions that have been made. Senator Siewert was talking all about people who haven't got a job. As has been so often said, the best form of welfare is a job, and, thanks to this government, 411,000 new jobs have been created in the last year. That's why we can do good things with the budget, because no longer are we paying those 411,000 people unemployment benefits. They're actually working and we're getting tax from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Dodson talked about First Nations people. As I have often said here and elsewhere and to my Indigenous friends up in the north, the best thing that we can do for Indigenous people is treat them like every other Australian, and the sooner we can do that, we will close the gap. We shouldn't separate them, in my view. We should give wealth and advantage where it is appropriate and we are doing that. Senator Scullion is doing marvellous things. But the best thing we can do is treat Indigenous people like every other Australian and not as a separate sub-class, which people on the other side seem to think is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The senator from New South Wales, Senator O'Neill, was going on about the ABC. The ABC gets a billion dollars of taxpayers' money every year. Now, if the ABC can't save because of the pause—$83 million—then they are even worse managers than I thought. Some of the journalists that work at the ABC, particularly in this building, are good journalists. But you get down to Ultimo and you get all the lefties who run the subediting stuff and who really are just mouthpieces for the Labor Party and the Greens. I gave Senator McKim a book earlier about Manus Island. The ABC continue to run the left-wing theme on Manus and Nauru. I should have got the ABC a copy of this wonderful book about the untold story on Manus, the truth on Manus. The ABC could easily find $87 million out of a total budget of $1 billion every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me say this to the ABC—and I can warn them the government will be closely watching—one of the things the ABC does very, very well, and it has my full support, is the regional service it provides to audiences where there aren't any other providers. You go to Ultimo in Sydney and there are, what, 23 different commercial stations—TV, radio. You've got plenty of choice in Sydney. In the regions, very often there is only one source of information and that's the ABC, and they do a wonderful job. But, if the ABC think that they are going to punish the coalition by cutting services in the country, let me warn them: they will have a real fight on their hands if that happens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been through this before. We do have a better ABC board these days, and I'm sure they will understand that there is a real opportunity to shave the bloated bureaucracy and the subeditors, the left-wing cabal, who are in the back rooms of the ABC, and get onto their main purpose of disseminating real information, not the opinions of some first-year journalist who has been to university and picks up on the sort of rubbish you hear from the unions. Some journalists actually report facts, not their opinions. I'm quite sure the ABC can do that and I'm quite sure they can do it while maintaining a real service in country Australia, which is a service I totally support. I congratulate and thank the ABC people who do actually work in country Australia.</span>

I love it. It just shows that everything I say is right on the mark.</span>

I'd like to pay tribute to Nick, who included me on his South Australian Senate ticket in 2016 and who made a significant contribution to South Australia through his considerable political service. I thank Senator Griff, former Senator Kakoschke-Moore and others for supporting that decision. I intend to uphold the values and spirit of accountability and transparency that the Nick Xenophon Team articulated when I stood for election in 2016. The process of careful review I've undertaken with the important bills before me in my first two weeks in March and now is consistent with that spirit. I will judge legislation and other measures put before me on their individual merits, assessing proposals against four benchmarks: integrity, fairness, prosperity and sustainability. I will not engage in trade-offs for political gain. I will not compromise on what I think is in the interests of South Australians and our nation. I believe the South Australian people expect and deserve no less.

              <span class="HPS-Normal">Commitment to integrity is rooted in my upbringing. I was born in 1969 in Loxton, a town in the Riverland region of South Australia. Loxton remains the place where I developed a strong sense of community and belonging. Growing up in Loxton gave me a deep connection with our land. The mighty River Murray and the surrounding banks of reeds, inlets and scrub was the natural world in all its spectacular glory, and was in many ways our playground. I fondly remember waterskiing when I was just four years old, off Proud's Sandbar just outside of Loxton. It's where we spent time with friends and family, and it gave me a close appreciation of nature.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a child in Loxton for me meant a feeling of idyllic freedom, of imagination and time, and a sense of a higher purpose. This sense also developed at St Albert's Catholic Primary School in Loxton and at St Ignatius. It was reflected in my early passion for middle- and long-distance running. Robert de Castella was a particular hero, and I was inspired by his world record run in the 1981 Fukuoka marathon and his come-from-behind victory at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The late Brother Paul Callil was another inspiration. His encouragement to all of us at school to strive for our personal best in athletics influenced me greatly.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Studying economics at Adelaide university and then an MBA at the Australian National University, I learned the importance of hard work and the value of impartial factual evidence in guiding actions for the greater good. The revelations of the banking royal commission and of various state integrity commissions remind us of the critical importance of demanding integrity in both government and the corporate world. This requires stronger accountability and transparency arrangements. This is why I will push for real-time registration of political donations. In a digital age, it is not good enough to have paper disclosures reported on annually in non-election years and 24 weeks after polling day in an election year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We can also do better to bring the South Australian people into the parliamentary process. With modern technology, the electorate can more easily have a voice. I therefore plan to invite the input of South Australians into my policy priorities as well as the questions and statements I make, providing them with a real-time voice in the Senate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My dedication to the principle of fairness comes from my parents. My father loved being a GP and sought to serve his patients with the utmost care and respect, moving to Loxton to broaden his ability to do so. My mother was an extraordinary English teacher, a lover of literature and a walking dictionary. They were pillars of their communities, continuously engaged in activities for our schools and their professional associations, and instilled in me a strong sense of service, humility, compassion and empathy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">A society is judged, I believe, on how it treats its most vulnerable, and that is why we must do more to address the refugee crisis, by finding a pathway to regional processing in Southeast Asia, and the homelessness crisis here in Australia, with an enhanced focus on providing public housing. It is cheaper to place the homeless in housing than to have them live on the streets and increase the pressure on our welfare resources. Finland and Utah, in the US, have demonstrated this.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost-of-living pressures are a major problem for our stability, security and quality of life. Housing affordability, for example, needs greater attention. It takes far longer these days for young families to buy a home than it did their parents. Rents are also increasingly prohibitive, especially for the less well off.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The appalling inadequacy of unemployment allowances is also an issue of fairness. Newstart hasn't risen in line with national living standards for a quarter of a century and it's simply not enough to live on. I endorse calls from respected economists, business and welfare groups to boost Newstart significantly, and I am incredibly disappointed that the government didn't pay attention to this in the budget. With the budget revealing a substantial improvement to revenue since Christmas, surely there was room for an increase in Newstart. As the Business Council of Australia noted as far back as 2012, the level of Newstart 'may now be so low as to represent a barrier to employment'. And this morning John Howard declared that the freeze had probably gone on too long.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">A discussion of fairness cannot ignore our First Nations people. I personally acknowledge the legacy of trauma and grief in communities as a result of colonisation, forced removals and other past government policies. It saddens me greatly that the 10th annual Closing the Gap report, in February this year, showed that only three of the seven targets are on track after a decade. It is shameful that, by percentage, more of our First Nations people are in jail than any other indigenous group in the world. The historic hand of reconciliation extended to our parliament through the Uluru Statement from the Heart remains unmet. I support calls for a First Nations voice in parliament to be enshrined in our Constitution and for a makarrata commission to supervise a process of truth telling and agreement making. I welcome initiatives to encourage more Indigenous entrepreneurship and participation in small and medium-sized businesses. The Commonwealth's Indigenous Procurement Policy should be adopted by all levels of government and more companies to drive demand for Indigenous goods and services and grow the Indigenous business sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My vision for our ongoing prosperity centres on our lucky proximity to and relationship with Asia. I've lived it since I got on a plane at the age of 23, just over 25 years ago, with a one-way ticket to Hong Kong. This was a seminal moment in my life. I was struck, on my first flight into Hong Kong, by the seemingly daredevil half-turn over high-rise apartments just 15 seconds before landing at Kai Tak Airport, right in the middle of the city. This apparently risky but regulation routine was repeated every five minutes throughout the day and said so much about the intensity and dynamism of that vibrant city.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Hong Kong at that time was bursting with entrepreneurs. The dynamic mindset—embracing change, seeking new horizons for experience and prosperity—has been a constant reminder to me to 'have a go'. This led me to my first role in Hong Kong, where I worked with the late Alison Wenck, who was the driving force behind a magazine aptly titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Austral-Asian Entrepreneur</span>, and from there to a career with entrepreneurial SMEs across Asia—from Guangzhou, to Haiphong, to Saigon, to Shanghai, or selling into Asia from Australia in Sydney and Adelaide.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It also led me to learn languages of the countries I was living in, be it Mandarin, which I've now resumed learning for the third time, or Vietnamese. I've always tried to learn the local language. It was both respectful and offered insights I could not have otherwise gained into the societies in which I was living. More Australian school students should be learning Asian languages for these reasons alone, as well as for other economic and strategic advantages. Life in Asia requires perseverance and a flexible, entrepreneurial mindset. Hard work, focus and having a go have helped raise hundreds of millions out of poverty in a generation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunities for permanent benefit for South Australia and Australia are obvious. In little more than a decade, it is estimated Asia will have a middle class of around three billion people, a 600 per cent increase in 20 years, whereas the middle class in Europe and the US combined will be 1.2 billion, just 40 per cent of Asia's. This is not just China. Presently our two-way trade with South-East Asia actually exceeds that with China, and opportunities for doing much more with South-East Asia as well as India are strong. We already see dramatic examples of what deepening trade with Asia can bring to our economy and society—a 63 per cent year-on-year increase in Australian wine exports to China in 2017, much of that from South Australia; the growth of international education to be our third-largest export industry; and the number of Chinese tourists doubling in the last five years to be our largest visitor market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Our proximity to Asia and the inherent strengths of 'brand Australia' in perceptions there put us in a superb position. We are automatically and rightly seen as high quality all over Asia. For a large country rich in land and natural resources with a relatively small population, foreign investment in Australia is essential to our development. We must resist knee-jerk reactions against investment by non-Western entities. We must also support more Australian companies and institutional investors to invest in Asian countries. We should also deepen engagement with Indonesia. Too much of our mindset is in looking beyond that country. Mutual opportunities are being missed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Asia provides new markets for entrepreneurship and innovation in South Australia about which I am passionate. I welcome the growth of incubators, hubs, co-working spaces, precincts and business parks that will further foster exciting development in our state. I also see great potential for South Australia around advanced manufacturing. From my recent business experience, there is clearly global demand for high-quality, advanced manufacturing products from our state. For example, we should capitalise on the opportunity to bring car manufacturing jobs back to South Australia through the electric vehicle revolution. EV car sales are growing internationally. All the major car brands are investing heavily in developing EVs to meet increasing demand. Australia is one of the few places that has all the natural and human resources needed to build an electric vehicle within a stable political environment. We have lithium and other minerals that are essential to making the batteries in cars themselves. We have the parts manufacturers and the engineers who can build the machines that will make these cars. But the missing piece of the pie is domestic EV uptake. We need the right policies and leadership to encourage this, and I'm disappointed that the government didn't focus on this in the budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also passionate about the positive impact that South Australia's arts and festivals have had for the state. Building on the legacy of Don Dunstan, Adelaide is an ideal place to foster creative entrepreneurial businesses, tourism, sport, film and television productions, and music.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Sustainability is important to me not just environmentally but also economically. We must have responsible, broad-based tax reform to create a more sustainable, equitable tax-and-transfer system. Our current budget deficit and debt demand it. Our present tax system is insufficiently robust to support a medium-term fiscal strategy of budget surpluses on average over the course of the economic cycle.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This may be my first speech, but I'm sure people want to know what I think about last night's budget, given the first major decision I had to make in this chamber concerned the government's enterprise tax plan. I welcome the first round of personal tax cuts announced in last night's budget. They are affordable; they are also neatly targeted and provide much needed relief for low- and middle-income earners. The benefits will flow directly into the economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have serious doubts about the last round of tax cuts due to come in six budgets and two elections from now. They would be regressive. There are questions about their affordability. The personal and company tax cuts proposed by the government do not amount to comprehensive tax reform. We should refocus on the principal reform elements of the Henry review into the tax and transfer system, commissioned 10 years ago this month. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">2015 Intergenerational report</span> notes, spending needs should take into account Australia's ageing population, which has important implications for the growing demand for health, aged care services and retirement incomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We should continue to support businesses with R&amp;D, innovation and industrial transformation; fund world-class education and health systems; harness the contribution potential of our youth and ageing populations; and increase investment in public infrastructure, which has the effect of stimulating economic growth at the same time as securing long-term benefits to our communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Amid all of this, we must not lose sight of the existential threat posed by human induced climate change. Climate change is the significant risk to our economy, national security and environment. As we know, tackling this issue will take strong and dedicated leadership and vision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, I want to refer to my passionate advocacy for the Australian republic. A home-grown Australian head of state is essential in a nation which defines itself as self-determining. It's ironic and telling that to be a member of this chamber you cannot hold British citizenship, but you must be British to be our head of state. I've been actively involved in advocating for an Australian republic for over a quarter of a century. I have fond yet also queasy memories of organising a pre-1999 republican referendum yum cha lunch, with speakers being former Prime Minister Whitlam and current Prime Minister Turnbull, in the floating Chinese restaurant in Rose Bay in Sydney.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators usually have six years to make their contribution in this place. From the time of my declaration by the High Court, my initial term will be 500 days. I look at this as a glass half full. I will make every day count and judge every issue on its merits against the benchmarks of integrity, fairness, prosperity and sustainability. These are principles I will uphold for the people of South Australia in my role as senator for them, and I hope that will meet with their continuing support. Thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATT:</span>
                  </a>  Grace is only beyond me when I'm talking about the government! I'm very gracious when I'm talking about other things but not when it comes to the government. This debate is about the government's devastating approach to managing both the economy and the Australian population in, on the one hand, handing an extremely large amount of money to big business in the form of a tax cut funded by ongoing and, indeed, new cuts to essential services that Australians depend upon very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very revealing that Senator Cormann was asked on three occasions in question time today to provide a figure for the value of the company tax cuts that this government wants to give. They have run away from this figure, just as we've seen them do in previous budgets. They are so embarrassed by the reaction of Australians to their proposal to cut tax rates for big business that they just will not say the figure. When it comes to the government, it's the figure that won't speak its name. We know that it's very likely that the figure adds up to $80 billion. This government proposes to hand $80 billion to big business in the form of a tax cut, with $17 billion of that going to the big banks, which we all know have had their egregious behaviour displayed recently through the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From a Queensland perspective, what's even worse about this big business tax cut is that there will be so little benefit to Queensland, and regional Queensland in particular. I recently obtained figures, based on ABS data, through the Parliamentary Library to ask the question: how much benefit will this tax cut provide to regional Queensland? The figures revealed that there are very few big businesses based in regional Queensland that will get any benefit from these company tax cuts. In the electorate of Dawson, there are six businesses that will gain anything from the next round of big business tax cuts. In Capricornia, there are eight. In Leichhardt, there are nine. In Herbert, there are 10. Once you get beyond regional Queensland to the electorate of Longman on the outskirts of Brisbane—an electorate that's going to have a lot of attention in coming weeks—there are only three businesses based there that will get any tax cut from this $80 billion windfall that is coming the way of big business. There is no benefit whatsoever to regional Queensland, no benefit to electorates like Longman, but lots of benefit to overseas hedge funds that own shares in the companies that are going to get this tax cut. Not only is there not going to be a benefit but it will come at the expense of ordinary Australians, because it's being funded by ongoing cuts to essential services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, on top of the existing cuts that this government has already announced—cuts to schools, cuts to hospitals, cuts to training, cuts to universities; the things that the average person in the street really depends upon have already been cut in order to give the big banks a massive tax cut—new cuts were announced. We now find out that there are going to be cuts to residential aged care. This government has spent a long time having a go at the Labor Party about how we regard old people, ignoring their cuts to pensions and all the things they've inflicted upon older people, but last night announced further cuts to residential aged care. There's going to be $40 million of new cuts to dental care for veterans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just older Australians who are in the government's firing line but also younger Australians. On top of the existing cuts we've already seen to TAFE and apprenticeships, there's now going to be another $270 million in additional cuts to TAFE and apprenticeships. The ABC, which many Australians love—particularly in regional Australia—is now going to face a further $80 million in cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So all of these cuts to older Australians, younger Australians, regional Australians, city Australians—it doesn't matter who you are; there is something being cut that you want and depend upon from this government—are to provide an $80 billion tax cut to big business. It is just not fair. It demonstrates yet again how out of touch this government is, and they continue to go on with it. I'm sure that in the coming by-elections we will see how Australians feel about this budget. We haven't got very long to wait, and I'm sure it will see the return of these Labor members by campaigning on these issues. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are all related, so I will spare people me speaking separately on all six documents and just speak to them all once. These six documents are required to be provided by the Commonwealth Ombudsman under the terms of the Migration Act 1958 with regard to assessing detention arrangements for people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for prolonged periods of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming back into this place not very long ago, I've had cause to speak to similar documents a number of times already, which in itself should be a cause of concern to the Senate, as I know it is of concern to many in the Australian population, because it reflects the fact that there are very large numbers of people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for many years. I do not have time in the now four minutes available to me to go through all of the cases here, but in these three documents there are probably close to 50 that have been assessed by the Ombudsman. Some of them have been assessed more than once. Many of them have been in imprisonment, also known as detention, for three, four, five years or longer. Many of them—or at least some of them—involve children as well. It is an ongoing indication of an inherent and innate flaw in our entire migration regime that we will leave people—who have in almost all of these cases committed no crime—jailed for years without any idea of when their detention will end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a major issue. Jailing people, particularly children, is a last resort. We are jailing them for years and not giving any sign of when they might get out of that situation. It is, without doubt, a massive breach of their human rights and a massive impact on their health and wellbeing. We cannot have the nice-sounding words that we often get from all of us here in this chamber across all political persuasions about our concern for mental health et cetera when we have laws and policies enacted that knowingly and in some cases deliberately cause major mental harm to people, including young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just use one example here of a woman with five children. She has an Australian husband but has been in detention for 1,276 days, which my calculator tells me is about 3½ years, with four of her children. Her fifth child is actually an Australian citizen. The Ombudsman report notes that it appears likely the family will remain in detention for a prolonged and uncertain period whilst they receive medical treatment and further notes the government's duty of care—this is not just a nice-sounding phrase; the government's duty of care, particularly to children, is a legal obligation—to detainees and the significant risk to mental and physical health posed by a prolonged and uncertain period of detention. If you look through these reports, you will see that phrase repeated quite often—so much so that it's almost a bit of a phrase repeated by rote and, I am sure, sadly, perceived as such by the minister. But we are talking about human beings here. The fact they are identified by numbers here does not mean they are not human, and the children here in this case are children. We should not be inflicting this torment, this torture, on innocent people, particularly children, and that is what we are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me cause to also mention the family taken away from Biloela I have spoken about in this place before and the fabulous support they've had from the community of Biloela in Queensland, going down to Melbourne supporting them in their court case to try and prevent them being sent back to a place where they will almost certainly be at risk. They are people who have been living in, working in and contributing to the community at Biloela who were ripped away in a dawn raid by armed police. I want to say thank you to the people and community of Biloela for supporting them and I want to say the minister needs to resolve that case and get them out of detention because that is where they are now, including those very young children. Similarly, a person who is not in detention but who has the same sort of issue is a woman who has had some media publicity. Bernadette, a Filipino woman who has an Australian child at risk is in fact being pressured very hard to leave this country and to leave her Australian son, who cannot go with her because of a Family Court order, behind. End that family's torment. End that woman's torment.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of the new bills examined in this report, 29 have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit, or do not engage, human rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to highlight two of these bills. Measures in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 actively promote human rights. The statement of compatibility usefully provides a detailed assessment of the human rights implications of the bill and how it achieves positive human rights outcomes. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 limits human rights, but in ways that are permissible under international human rights law. While the bill imposes limitations on a number of rights, the statement of compatibility provides an excellent analysis of how such limitations are proportionate to achieve their stated objective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such work by ministers and their departments in developing legislation with appropriate safeguards and preparing detailed statements of compatibility is to be commended. By addressing human rights issues at the outset, the committee's technical scrutiny function can be undertaken without the need to request further information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this report the committee needs to request further information in relation to the human rights compatibility of 10 bills and a number of legislative instruments, and has also provided three 'advice only' comments to legislation proponents. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee seeks to report in a timely manner so that its technical assessments of human rights compatibility can inform the legislative deliberations of the Parliament.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Chapter 2 of the report contains the committee's concluded examination of six bills and instruments. Following correspondence with the relevant minister, three of these bills and instruments are likely to be compatible with international human rights law. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the Treasury Laws Black Economy Taskforce Bill, questions arose as to whether the strict liability offences in the bill were compatible with the presumption of innocence. Following further information from the minister, including the existence of relevant safeguards and the specific regulatory context, the committee could conclude that the strict liability offences were likely to be compatible. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 1987, the Australian Government introduced the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) as a voluntary, alternative national registration scheme for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes solely involved in interstate trade or commerce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">FIRS was a response to industry concerns about state and territory registration schemes that, at the time, deterred and restricted interstate road transport. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was also designed to promote safer interstate trade and greater use of high productivity vehicles through an exemption for FIRS-registered vehicles from standard state and territory stamp duties for newly purchased vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, it provided a mechanism that made sure long haul heavy vehicles made an appropriate contribution to road maintenance through their registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">FIRS represented the first comprehensive land transport strategy for this nation. A tangible, collective commitment to improve the transportation of freight across the country by addressing challenges arising from a lack of uniformity in state and territory registration schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the thirty years since FIRS' introduction, a lot has changed. Heavy vehicles have grown in size, and the national road freight task has nearly tripled in that time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Articulated trucks now take on nearly 80 per cent of the freight task, with the use of B-double trucks, and with a notable shift by operators toward other Higher Productivity Vehicles, such as road trains. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The lack of coordination between states and territories that resulted in a haphazard regulatory environment no longer exists, through ongoing efforts by jurisdictions to harmonise heavy vehicle arrangements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Initiatives such as uniform registration charging agreements and increased ongoing communication between states and territories have made FIRS redundant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The numbers bear this out. The number of FIRS registered vehicles have declined steadily for nearly a decade after peaking at nearly 22,000 vehicles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As of 30 June 2017, there were 13,927 FIRS-registered vehicles (including trailers) in Australia, representing only 1.6 per cent of the Australian fleet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Independent modelling suggests the size of the FIRS fleet will continue to fall, reducing to approximately 1 per cent of the total fleet by 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An independent program evaluation (the Evaluation) in 2016 revealed the stamp duty exemption afforded by FIRS had not improved safety outcomes nor reduced fleet age, with industry figures showing the average fleet age to be around 14 years – a figure that has not reduced since the introduction of FIRS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Continuation of FIRS perpetuates an unfair situation where relatively few operators can access a financial benefit that around 98 per cent of heavy vehicle operators cannot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The decline of FIRS registrations, combined with the Evaluation report finding no evidence of FIRS achieving its policy objectives, support the Australian Government's conclusion that a tax exemption for a minority of operators is not sufficient reason to retain an ineffective regulatory program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Transport companies today require the flexibility to adjust their operations to suit changing customer requirements and market opportunities. Consistent feedback from industry has highlighted that flexibility is essential to being competitive and responsive to market changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's just not possible for many small businesses in the road transport industry, where around 70 per cent of operators have only one vehicle, to take advantage of FIRS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is imperative that we protect Australian small businesses and remove policies that may impede the growth of a sector so crucial to preserving our standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">FIRS was established as one mechanism to provide funding for road maintenance, but this remains a challenge. The Australian Government is pursuing reforms with states and territories through the Heavy Vehicle Road Reform mechanism, independent from FIRS, as this approach will be far more effective than the current reliance on FIRS' shrinking base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is the first step in the delivery of a new system that better serves the needs of today's transport industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with the stance of Australian Governments' since 2009 and affirmed by the COAG Transport and Infrastructure Council in May 2017, this Bill will progressively close FIRS and make way for the progress of national heavy vehicle reforms, beginning with a modern national registration system for heavy vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The national registration system will be open to all operators in states and territories participating in the Heavy Vehicle National Law reforms, and is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2018. This Bill seeks to facilitate this transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2018, existing FIRS operators will seamlessly move to the new registration system once their current FIRS registration period concludes, and will immediately be able to access benefits associated with the new system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Full closure will take place on 30 June 2019. Existing FIRS operators moving to the national registration system by this date will be eligible for a once-off stamp duty exemption, as well as immediate access to the benefits of the new system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has changed in the last 30 years. Our needs are different, our priorities have changed and our collective regulatory capabilities have also improved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The closure of FIRS is the next logical step in moving Australia towards a more productive and effective heavy vehicle registration policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Traditional lotteries and keno games are popular and long-standing recreational gambling products that form an important income stream for thousands of small businesses across Australia, including newsagents, pharmacies, pubs, RSLs and community clubs. They provide millions of dollars in tax revenue to every state and territory in Australia and help fund important services and infrastructure for the community such as hospitals, schools, public transport and roads. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every time a customer buys a ticket in an official lottery draw, a percentage of the ticket price goes toward supporting community services and small business owners. Official lotteries have keno games have been a feature of the Australian gambling product landscape for a long time, and are well understood and accepted by consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast, lottery and keno betting services are relatively new. They provide little taxation revenue and absolutely no benefits to the thousands of small business owners across Australia. Furthermore, with the light regulation imposed on these services, they can entice customers away from traditional lotteries and keno games which further impacts the benefits to the community and small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians have voiced their concerns about the emergence of lottery and keno betting services. The Government has carefully considered these concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last year, the Minister for Communications raised these concerns with the responsible Minister in the Northern Territory, which so far is the only jurisdiction to licence lottery betting. The Northern Territory Government responded by introducing a partial prohibition on lottery betting, such that betting could not be offered on Australian lotteries. Whilst this was a positive step, the Australian Government believes stronger and more comprehensive action is required.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Traditional lotteries are heavily regulated and pay a considerable amount of tax to all states and territories. For every lottery ticket sold, up to 28 per cent is allocated to state and territory taxes to support regulatory oversight and government services, whilst up to 9 per cent is paid to agents for relevant sales costs and income requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016-17, it was estimated that official lotteries paid $1.1 billion in state and territory taxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over $350 million is earnt by some 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agents across Australia from sales of official lottery products. Newsagents rely on this money to run their businesses. Traditional keno services conducted in clubs and hotels across Australia help support community services and sporting initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In comparison, lottery and keno betting services contribute significantly less tax and only to one jurisdiction in Australia. They do not pay any commissions to small businesses. It is clear that a shift away from official lotteries will have a negative impact on state taxation revenue and small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Traditional lotteries are built on guaranteed prize pools from ticket sales and are required to comply with strict audit and consumer protection measures. Unlike official lotteries, lottery betting services are not required to comply with the guaranteed prize pool model – instead, their major prizes are covered by insurance policies. This allows lottery betting service providers to offer bigger prizes more frequently which further impacts on the financial benefits of traditional lotteries. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The intent of the Interactive Gambling Act is to minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia by limiting the types of interactive gambling services to Australians. Lottery betting services allow consumers to bet on the outcome of up to 25 lottery draws being conducted around the world each week, with the promise of massive jackpots ranging in the hundreds of millions, which could lead to problem and at-risk gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will prohibit the provision of lottery and keno betting services to customers physically present in Australia. It will also prohibit the betting on a 'contingency that may or may not happen in the course of the conduct of a lottery' to ensure that bets cannot be accepted on the outcome, or any aspect, of a lottery or keno draw. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth is responsible for online gambling matters and is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. This is consistent with the important work being done to establish the National Consumer Protection Framework, which aims to standardise harm minimisation controls for wagering services across all states and territories. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments to the Interactive Gambling Act will also enable the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the ACMA) to enforce compliance, and respond to any complaints about lottery betting services being provided by either Australian or international operators. The Government recently expanded the powers of the ACMA to take stronger action against the provision of illegal interactive gambling services to Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is heavily reliant on international shipping. Ninety-nine per cent of our imports and exports by weight are carried by ships. Therefore, as a government, it is our duty to ensure that our laws for the prevention of marine pollution are adequate, up to date and consistent with international law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill I present today, the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, will ensure that the framework for preventing marine pollution is in line with international requirements. It will also allow for consistency between key pieces of legislation that implement our obligations domestically, and provide for the continued application of the Protection of the Sea levy legislation without unnecessary regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill primarily amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983</span>, known as the POTS Act. The POTS Act, together with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Navigation Act 2012, </span>implement domestically our international obligations stemming from the <span style="font-style:italic;">International Convention for the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prevention of Pollution from Ships </span>(known as MARPOL) adopted at the International Maritime Organization, or IMO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the POTS Act set out in this Bill will implement Australia's international obligations to ensure that the master of a ship has vital information relating to relevant cargoes on board before discharging the residues of those cargoes. This will allow the master to discharge these residues appropriately, and only into the sea where it has been determined, and declared that the cargo residues are not harmful to the marine environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's implementation of these amendments to MARPOL is consistent with our long­‑standing support for protection of the marine environment, and our active backing of, and participation in the IMO. </span>

The amendment will remove the need for regulations to prescribe the manner in which a Protection of the Sea levy notice may be served in particular circumstances. This minor change will allow the <span style="font-style:italic;">Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Regulations</span> to be repealed, removing a dated and now‑unnecessary piece of regulation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm standing here today to, obviously, speak in favour of the motion to disallow the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017. Of course, we've all seen the stories—there is story after story of how water is being stolen from the environment by greedy corporate irrigators. We know this because we've seen these reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> and in numerous articles in the Fairfax newspapers. We've seen the stories written in local newspapers. We've heard the stories from farmers on small, family owned farms. We've heard them from members in the community who live throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. They are reports of corruption, theft, undermining and downright sabotage of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The file of these reports shows how appallingly the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been managed and how it is being implemented. No longer can Canberra continue to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, when the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was enacted, it was promised that this would be the plan that ended the water wars across state borders. This would be the plan that ensured that the water that the river needs would be returned to the river, to the environment, to ensure that the Murray-Darling had a fighting chance of survival.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I have here is a file of all of the various reports of how the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been misused: reports of water theft, dodgy figures, lack of water meters and undermining of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In this file are stories of millions of litres of water that were meant for the environment and that are now going to the big corporate irrigators, embedded with their mates—and I will say it here: their mates in the National Party. There are stories of water bureaucrats being pulled before ICAC in New South Wales for allegations of offering to share secret departmental files with irrigation lobbyists. There are stories of billions in spending achieving nothing at all, of senior water experts saying this plan is not working and then losing their jobs because they dared to speak the truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the background of all of these stories is the sound of a dying river. What it takes to secure the river is more water, not less. This is what the expert consensus tells us. And yet we are here today to vote on whether we remove 605 billion litres from the river every year and pay $1.3 billion for the privilege. We're paying more than a billion dollars to vote on a series of projects that have not been scrutinised because they don't have a business case to scrutinise. We don't know the details of these projects, as outlined in these amendments that this disallowance attempts to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently, this place is about to vote for them anyway. We've heard of the deal between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. There is $1.3 billion on the table for 37 projects that this Senate has no idea about—whether they are going to work and what the details of them are. This is because the Labor Party has backflipped and backslid into supporting the coalition government with a handshake in exchange for a cut. Labor has achieved nothing in its dirty deal with the Liberal Party. In exchange, the Labor Party have sold out everything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that isn't what Labor thinks. Labor is very good at spinning for all they are worth—you do a good job over there! Labor's spin would have us think that they've secured the world and then some. Let's have a look at how much it costs to buy Labor's vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's environment spokesperson, Tony Burke, says that Labor has won the following commitments from the government to vote against this disallowance moved by the Greens today: (1) an expression of interest to commence the recovery of 450 gigalitres of upwater environmental flows; (2) an assurance that 650 gigalitres of downwater will be delivered by linking the payments of supply measures with efficiency measures for environmental water; and (3) a 'package of measures' which Labor says represents, 'A serious response to the allegations of water theft in the northern basin,' including daily extraction limits and embargoes on irrigators pumping during environmental water releases, as well as no meter, no pump rules and a northern basin commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That all sounds very impressive until you start to take a closer look. Let's just pull apart this dirty deal just for a second. Let's take the 450 gigalitres and start with the commitment to recover that inefficiency measure. The Labor Party says it has managed to extract a commitment from the government that is literally identical—literally identical!—to what the government was already saying. So they got the government to repeat themselves. In his first week on the job, water minister, David Littleproud, told reporters he would support the basin plan's recommendations in full, including the recovery of an extra 450 gigalitres of productive water to supply environmental assets. Of course he would say that, because that is what he had already agreed to do. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Implementing Water Reform in the Murray Darling Basin says at section 4.6:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth has committed a further $1.58 billion to recover 450GL of environmental water with neutral or beneficial socio-economic impacts …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It said that in 2013 when Labor was in government. It said it in 2017 when the coalition was in government. Labor's then water minister in South Australia, Ian Hunter, belled the cat the same way, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 450 gigalitres is not an optional part of the basin plan. It was agreed to in 2012 and we have to deliver it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I don't know what Labor thinks they have secured but a reiteration of what they have already said. Labor's backflip has achieved an agreement from the government to keep saying what it's always has been saying. Labor has achieved a commitment to recover what Labor already committed to recover and what the coalition already committed to recover. Labor says this means the 450 gigalitre recovery target is back on the table. Presumably it was on the table when it was explicitly detailed in the Water Act. Presumably it was on the table when it was explicitly detailed in the basin plan itself in three separate sections. Presumably it was on the table when the water minister himself said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've made a decision to support the plan and that's part of the plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you go into a negotiation and your big ask is to get the other party to not change a thing, it's hard to lose that negotiation. It achieves not a single drop of water. It achieves an expression of interest. That does not guarantee a single drop of water. There's no certainty that anything will eventuate other than a cut. That is all that has been achieved here—another cut. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the second point of Labor's dirty deal with the government on this issue: assurance—assurance that Labor is so proud of. Labor's assurance to link the 605 gigalitres with the 450 gigalitres is literally just what the government—wait for it—had already said. In an opinion piece in January 2018, water minister David Littleproud said, 'The 450 gigalitres for the river and the 650 gigalitres for irrigators are tied together.' In February 2018 he said the same thing, telling one reporter: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">All players must understand the 605GL of 'downwater' and the 450GL of 'upwater' are tied together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would be forgiven for thinking that Labor has been scouring the water minister's media transcripts for things to demand in their negotiations, because Labor has sold its soul and they have sold out the river. They have sold out South Australia. Their greatest hit for this negotiation is the water minister's own media lines. What is worse is that this assurance is worth literally nothing. Labor says this government can't be trusted to keep its word. They say that when it comes to schools, they say it when it comes to hospitals, they say it when it comes to Medicare, they say it when it comes to the ABC and they say it when it comes to pensions. But, when it comes to water, all of a sudden the Labor Party is satisfied to take the government's promises at face value. Give me a break. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This really begs the question, if all it takes for the Labor Party is to trust the word of the Turnbull government on water, and what the water minister says he'll do, why did they bother negotiating at all? After all, Labor's demands were to just get Minister Littleproud to reiterate what he had already said. If you can trust the Turnbull government to do what they have said they will already do, then the Labor Party, really, has achieved nothing at all. That is what this comes down to: if you are content to believe that the Turnbull government will do what they say they will do, then Labor didn't secure any new commitments. If you don't think that you can trust the Turnbull government at its word, then the Labor Party has simply secured nothing. They've secured nothing. The 'trust us, she'll be right, mate' doesn't cut it, and this government has proven that when it comes to water, when it comes to the environment and when it comes to the health of the Murray River and the Coorong in South Australia the Turnbull government's word is rubbish. It cannot be trusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk quickly about the third point that Labor has apparently negotiated in order to sellout South Australia, the River Murray and the Coorong, at the lower end of the system and the Murray mouth. That third element, of course, is in relation to compliance measures. Labor has crowed about how it has achieved new compliance measures. Let's have a look at them. The key plank to the basin plan reform is to put a cap on the level of extraction. If there is no compliance there is no cap. With no cap there is no reform. That's why compliance has been at the centre of the plan since its inception. It's so important that compliance measures are strong and penalties are enforced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what Labor actually achieved. It says it's achieved a commitment to introduce a new rule in the northern basin: no meter, no pump. The New South Wales government announced it was already doing this in December 2017. It says it has achieved a commitment to daily extraction limits. This was also already achieved and flagged by the New South Wales government in February 2018—another reiteration of the minister's press releases. It says it's achieved a commitment to have embargoes on irrigation pumping during the release of environmental water flows. This was already put in place by the New South Wales government in April this year. In fact, the only thing that is new is the northern basin commissioner and it is also the only idea that was not mentioned anywhere in the Murray-Darling Basin review into water compliance. They didn't think a commissioner was going to cut it either. So everything that Labor went in asking for is what we already had. As for the one new thing, nobody liked the idea anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me bring us back to why we are here today and the vote that we are going to be having. Labor says it has extracted a series of commitments from the government, but, in fact, Labor has achieved nothing. In exchange, it has agreed to throw $1.5 billion at a series of projects that have no experience of scrutiny. No-one's seen the details. Either the government have them or they don't, and if they have them why are they hiding them? If they don't have them, why on earth are the government asking the Senate to sign-off on $1.5 billion with a 'trust us' attitude? The business cases for these projects that form the basis of an amendment have been not finalised. They have not been made available to the public or to the senators who today will vote on this amendment. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority are now saying that is because the business cases have not been finalised. Even the Murray-Darling Basin Authority doesn't know what the final cases will look like. What this means is that there's not a single senator in this place today voting on this disallowance who knows what they are voting for. Not one person in this room will know what they are actually voting for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's reflect on that. We are voting to spend more than $1 billion with no underlying information about what we're buying. This is from the party that prides itself on economic management. This is from the Labor Party that says it values transparency and accountability. Not a single person in this room knows which projects will deliver what outcomes. Not a single person in the country knows. What we are doing is voting to spend $1.3 billion of taxpayers' money on a hope that we will get something in return for it six years from now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what are we giving away as we do this? We're voting for the money to start flowing when the water won't be. What we're doing in the context of allegations of rampant water theft, of corruption, of mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, of rorts, of rip-offs, of a royal commission, of an ICAC investigation and of fraud charges being laid in Queensland is handing off $1.3 billion while cutting 605 billion litres from the river and the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a very proud South Australian. Last week I was down at the Murray mouth and the Coorong, and those places are sick. They need a drink. The whole point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was that this place promised it would give the environment back its fair share so that all the communities that rely on a healthy Murray-Darling Basin would have access to it—so that all communities who rely on the Murray-Darling Basin for their livelihood would know it would be there for generations to come. There was a minimum amount of water promised to the environment. It was even less than the scientists said would be needed. It was the bare, bare minimum needed to give it any kind of fighting chance. And here today this government, lining up with the Labor Party, is going to vote to cut the environmental flows from the river again. It can't afford another cut. The Murray mouth is being dredged; the Coorong is sick; and rivers die from the mouth up. If we don't give this river system the drink it desperately needs, it's not going to be here for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore the senators in this chamber today: don't vote for something you haven't even seen the detail of, don't saddle the taxpayer with funding projects that have no business case, and don't sell out future generations. The truth is: there are no jobs on a dead river.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was negotiated during the millennium drought, in an atmosphere of crisis, based on the perception that drought was the new normal. As a result, it is deeply flawed. Had the plan been developed in a normal year, I am confident it would have been substantially different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This disallowance motion, if passed, would not improve the plan. It's based on the simplistic notion that all the environment needs is more water—not the right amount of water in the right place at the right time, just more water. In the last parliament I chaired the Senate Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which inquired into the implementation of the plan. The committee spent a lot of time examining what was right and what was wrong with the plan and how it was being implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is naturally a land of droughts and flooding rains. Droughts are normal, and too much water can be as harmful as not enough. We had plenty of people telling us the plan was great because it would add more water to the environment, and that the amounts of recovered water in the plan were absolutely essential, yet not once did someone tell us that an environmental watering plan was required in a particular area that didn't have one—not once. We had people tell us they'd like water in the Menindee Lakes, and I sympathise with that, but they wanted it for recreational purposes, not the environment. The fact is there is now an abundance of water available for the environment, and if any more water is added to the Murray River it won't have the capacity to carry it within its banks. It's full, and nobody wants to take responsibility for the damage to private property that will occur if there is man-made flooding caused by adding more water to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of the Murray: it's not a natural environment. In nature it ends in an estuary, and so water would naturally come in when the river flow is low and water would go out when flow is high. The mouth might close from time to time, but it would be open much of the time due to natural tidal scouring. Since 1940 the Murray has not been allowed to operate like a normal estuary. There are barrages near its mouth that prevent the sea from coming in when river flows are low. As a consequence, its mouth is now rarely open naturally. During the spring of 2016, for example, there were major floods in the Murrumbidgee, Murray and Goulburn rivers which saw flows to South Australia in excess of 60,000 megalitres per day for over five weeks, peaking at over 94,000 megalitres on 30 November. From 30 November until 18 December, flows across the South Australian border exceeded 65,000 megalitres per day, and yet on 9 January 2017 the South Australian government resumed dredging of the Murray mouth. The five weeks of high flows had failed to clear sandbars at the Murray mouth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Natural tidal scouring of the Murray mouth is severely restricted by the presence of the barrages, which prevent the entry of sea water into Lake Alexandrina and also by Bird Island, which is located directly in front of the Murray mouth. And Bird Island has only formed since the barrages were erected. It continues to grow in size and impede flow, and it would not be there in a natural environment. And the Murray is the only river in Australia with an artificially fresh estuary. Because of the barrages, the mouth of the Murray cannot even remain open one year in 10, no matter how much water is sent down the Murray.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet one of the aims of the plan is to keep the Murray mouth open nine years out of 10. This is not a realistic environmental outcome and should not be an objective of the plan. In fact, what happens to a lot of the water that flows down the Murray and the Darling is that it evaporates in the Lower Lakes. That's Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert. Between 800 and 900 gigalitres of fresh water evaporates per annum. That is one-third of all the water saved in the plan. If this evaporation were sea water or, more correctly, a mixture of sea and fresh water, a significant amount of fresh water would be available for consumptive or environmental use within the basin. If this water were used for agriculture production, the potential benefit is worth $300 million to $900 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is deeply flawed. It gives no consideration to the barrages that prevent the entry of sea water and whether they are still required or there are better options for preventing sea water from mixing with Adelaide's water supply. Amazingly, the plan excludes the Coorong, probably the most neglected environment in South Australia. I'm delighted that Senator Hanson-Young has now decided to agree with me about that. She didn't when I first raised it. And yet, no matter how much water is sent down the rivers, it won't benefit the Coorong. With the Murray mouth nearly always closed, it doesn't get properly flushed by sea water, which it would if the environment was operating naturally. To claim it should be assisted by more fresh water flowing down the Murray, as Senator Hanson-Young has done, is utterly absurd. The Coorong's narrow entrance is seaward of the barrages and operates in an unnatural tidal environment dictated by the barrages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, the Coorong in its natural state would receive a lot of run-off from the surrounding area. However, that's not happening. That's because of the South East Drainage Network, which diverts fresh water to the sea instead of the Coorong. If that water were allowed to flow into the Coorong as it previously did, it would restore the natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental outcomes in the basin have improved since the end of the drought. However, it's not clear whether the improvement is due to the 2011 and 2016 floods and improved water, the results of the existing Living Murray program initiatives or environmental watering under the plan. This uncertainty is due in part to the failure to set baseline environmental benchmarks and to report against those benchmarks. This is unacceptable, given the expense of the plan to taxpayers. What is clear is that water taken from Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian agriculture has had a devastating impact on rural communities. It is also clear that more water sent to South Australia will have no additional environmental benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The environment can be an emotional subject for some people, but it's high time some facts and reason were applied to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. South Australian politicians who don't know the difference between the Darling and Murray rivers, who can't explain why the Lower Lakes should remain fresh and who can't explain why the Coorong is dying, are part of the problem; they are not part of the solution.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate. First and foremost, I want to put on the record that the current shadow spokesman, Mr Tony Burke, has an impeccable record in this area of portfolio responsibility. The previous Labor minister, Senator Wong, also had a very outstanding record in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are people in the Senate who don't understand the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, I commend the contribution to the National Press Club in 2012 made by the then Minister Burke. He clearly sets out the entire history and evolvement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. One thing that particularly struck me, just to demonstrate his environmental credentials, was the contribution he made in a couple of paragraphs there. He said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it was in 1991 when the game changer arrived and a new player turned up to the negotiating table. In 1991 the new player arrived with a blue-green algae outbreak that went for one thousand kilometres and the environment turned up to the negotiating table and proved to be more ruthless and less compromising than any of the states. The environment turned up to the negotiating table in 1991 and said, if you're going to manage the river this way then none of you can have the water. Effectively, the rivers decided collectively that if we were going to manage the water as though it stopped at state boundaries then the water was willing to stop …</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the environmental credentials of the shadow minister and former minister, in my view, are absolutely impeccable. He does understand the whole range of complexity in this century-old plan. We have to get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution from Senator Hanson-Young, I thought, was more parochial and more provocative than normal. If she has a preselection problem in South Australia, she shouldn't bring it in here and talk about it in this section. Don't bring it and talk about it in here as a disallowance motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's credentials, I believe, are impeccable. Our spokesperson is across all of the issues. In my view, we went through the appropriate processes, with consultation and caucus agreement, and we struck a deal. The deal is simply this: we will not support the Disallowance of the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017 for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, nor will we support a future disallowance motion on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern basin review</span>. This decision by the Labor Party means that the delivery of the full Murray-Darling Basin Plan will be back on track with new levels of compliance and transparency. This agreement means that the 450 gigalitres is back on track and will start to be accumulated, and the compliance will return to the northern basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson-Young did make some useful comments: the compliance was in question in the northern basin. I've seen that evidence. I've seen the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners </span>review. I've participated in hearings up and down the Darling and the Murray rivers. We do know that certain areas of the river are better at compliance enforcement and the use of efficient measures and infrastructure than others, but this agreement means we will be back on track. In reaching this decision Labor has been mindful of ensuring that all elements of the plan will be properly implemented, the independence of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be preserved and the demands that we put forward in February of 2018 will be met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legitimate questions have been posed regarding the content of the Northern Basin Review and the SDL adjustment mechanism. The best way to deal with these concerns is through improved transparency and new auditing and compliance requirements to ensure a healthy working basin. Labor has also determined to make sure that decisions about the volumes required to restore the health of the river system are determined by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and do not instead become the subject of daily amendment through the political process. The proper people should be in charge, and they are the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has an assurance around the government's commitment to deliver 450 gigalitres of environmental water through efficiency measures. We have assurances that the concerns regarding the quality of projects to deliver the 605 gigalitres of environmental equivalent outcomes will be resolved, as will be the need for taxpayer funded environmental water to be used for environment purposes, a comprehensive response to the allegations of corruption and water theft in the northern basin, Indigenous consultation and engagement in water planning and governance, and the accuracy of data in modelling assumptions. The government has provided a new package of measures, which provides Labor with sufficient confidence that the basin plan is back on track. These measures include the commencement of the recovery of 450 gigalitres of environmental water through an expression of interest and assurance that the 605 gigalitres will be delivered by linking payments for supply measures with efficiency measures for the 450 gigalitres for the environment. Critically, this means that the 450 gigalitres, which was put in doubt by the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, is now back on the table and the process to acquire the water will now commence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of measures also means that there is a serious response to the allegations of water theft in the northern basin, which had the potential to undermine the foundations in the water market on which the plan rests. These include the protection of environmental water through daily extraction limits; embargoes on irrigation pumping during environmental water releases; metering and no meter, no pump rules; and a new northern basin commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will commit to strengthening the SDL reconciliation process, and we will work with stakeholders about the best way to do this, whether it is through a legislative change or guaranteeing the independence of the reconciliation. If upon reconciliation the projects did not deliver the full 605 gigalitres, Labor would make up the shortage through a buyback. This puts the Murray-Darling Basin Plan back on a solid footing to a brighter pathway for the river's return to health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is Labor's position in a nutshell. I absolutely and categorically reject all of the assertions that were made about Labor's position by the senator for the Greens party. We have a way forward which has integrity. We are represented by the best people in the shadow cabinet in this area. They have a long track record and history. They understand and have environmental concerns in their DNA, so to speak. If you do want to find out or know a little more about the history of this plan, I commend the National Press Club speech by the Hon. Tony Burke.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young. This motion seeks to disallow the government's approval of the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism projects. As I remarked in my contribution to the debate on the Northern Basin Review disallowance, there has been a significant reduction in confidence in the basin plan's implementation over the last 12 months, with serious allegations that arose last year of rorting, water theft, dodgy water buybacks, a lack of compliance, questionable modelling, a dearth of transparency from within the MDBA, and new claims by the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin royal commissioner, Bret Walker SC, that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority may have fallen into legal error. The proper execution of the plan has well and truly fallen into error.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of reviews, and some of them have been mentioned by my colleagues in the chamber. There were the Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review and the Matthews review in New South Wales. The Auditor-General has conducted a review. There is an ICAC inquiry ongoing in New South Wales, there is a South Australian royal commission and, indeed, a Queensland review into water related matters. I can see that some of those reviews have concluded and that there are some very good recommendations in those reviews, but those recommendations have not yet been implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 36 SDL projects proposed for Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, to allow 605 gigalitres of water to be returned to irrigators on the basis that the projects give an equivalent quantity of water back to the environment. These projects are at various stages of development. Some of them are at scoping, some of them are being advanced and some of them are actually in operation. Back in February, Centre Alliance sought the technical assessments that the MDBA had made in relation to those 36 projects, and did that by way of an order for the production of documents. That order for production was returned to the Senate. It was returned late, but I must admit that it was returned in full.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The day after that was tabled in the Senate, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority wrote to Centre Alliance to confirm that the technical assessments of the 36 projects that had been tabled, obtained through that order for production, showed an incomplete picture of the state of affairs. So that means that the Senate is being asked to vote on the approval of the SDL projects without a complete picture of the state of affairs. That means that we require a degree of trust and confidence, and remember that at the start I said that public confidence has eroded in the execution of the plan. It requires the confidence that the projects will be implemented in a way that will result in positive environmental and socioeconomic outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party—and, I gather, some of my colleagues on the crossbench—obviously have trust and confidence that the projects will deliver these outcomes. Centre Alliance, at this point in time, do not. This does not mean that we will never have the necessary level of trust and confidence to support the SDL projects, but at this point in time we cannot justify supporting changes to the SDLs. A lack of transparency, coupled with the criticism of the MDBA's technical analysis, does not fill me with confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm strongly of the view that no senator who is conducting due diligence in their consideration of the passage of the SDL adjustment mechanism instrument could possibly support the changes if they were aware of the incomplete dataset that is available to them. And it's not as though senators haven't had the opportunity to have private briefings on the proposed changes. I know this, because I have visited both the New South Wales and the Victorian state authorities that are proposing and implementing these plans. When I visited them, I asked them, 'How many other senators have come and had a bit of a chat to you about what you're doing?' And the answer was zero; I was the first. I find this quite remarkable. Not one senator who is voting on this disallowance motion, even Senator Hanson-Young, who has moved the motion, has sat down with the Victorian or New South Wales public servants who are responsible for implementing the business cases of the SDL adjustment projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So while Centre Alliance is fully supportive of the plan being executed in full, it has to be implemented properly. A plan by name only is not a plan, and it's not very useful. Centre Alliance's informed view is that it is necessary to stop and take stock of the situation before making adjustments to the plan. The plan should be paused, even if it's just for a short period of time, to let some of the compliance measures be put in place, or to answer some of the questions about some of the modelling or, indeed, to allow the full dataset—and I note the Senate did support an OPD today for the remaining data necessary to review these projects. But, until we have that full information, we should pause and reconsider. We need to wait for the compliance and transparency measures proposed by both the states and the Commonwealth to take effect and for the legal situation to be properly examined. There is a legal controversy now that probably needs to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of Minister Littleproud and Assistant Minister Ruston as I undertook the due diligence work that I did. Although we may disagree on some of the issues, I appreciated that they undertook to provide me with further information that was necessary to increase the transparency of the SDL adjustment mechanism approval process not just for the Senate but for all interested parties. That includes the general public. The general public needs to be able to see this data. I acknowledge that Assistant Minister Ruston has given an undertaking there will be more transparency. To date, she has honoured her undertakings to me on the Murray-Darling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as with all disallowance motions, time is of the essence and, despite trying to get more information, the race against time has been lost. Centre Alliance cannot support the SDL adjustment mechanisms at this time.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I remember when the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was finalised about a decade ago, and there was such hope. We'd had the millennium drought. It was clear that the river system was in such dire straits. It was absolutely on its knees. It was such a political, hard-fought, fraught issue. I remember the negotiations and finally the agreement coming down that there would be environmental flows on average of 3,200 gigalitres a year allocated to the river. I remember that that in itself was a compromise. The scientists, the people who knew the river so well, absolutely felt that more was required. That 3,200 gigalitres was a compromise and everybody thought, 'Maybe if we get the 3,200 gigalitres it'll just be enough to keep this river system, this lifeblood of half of Australia, healthy.' That was the context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the decade since, fortunately the drought broke. Good. But it seems that the pressure has gone off and there's a sense that maybe that 3,200 gigalitres wasn't really as essential as it was painted to be back when the plan was finalised. Then we have had the political context and layer over that Murray-Darling Basin Plan which has been added over the last decade, particularly what has come to light over the last year—the water theft, the fraud and the appalling rorting of the whole plan by corporate irrigators in the upstream reaches of the basin. That puts the whole basin plan into a different perspective. We've got that figure of 3,200 gigalitres, but it's clear that quite a lot players involved in this were never serious about 3,200 gigalitres. We had the 450 gigalitres that was obviously seen to be an optional extra. That never had a strong commitment to it. There has been pressure for that not to be delivered. Then we had the sustainable diversion limits and now this sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism actually taking yet another huge chunk out of that 3,200 gigalitres which—remember—I said was acknowledged at the beginning of the plan as being the absolute minimum that was required for the river to stay healthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move from that political, bureaucratic context in talking about megalitres to talk about what this means for the river. My colleague Senator Hanson-Young speaks so eloquently and so passionately about the impacts of this basin plan on the river in South Australia. As a Victorian senator I have a particular passion for the Murray in its Victorian reaches, particularly the river system and the river red gum forests of Victoria. I took the opportunity recently to go and visit some of the remaining river red gum forests in Victoria near Swan Hill, the Nyah-Vinifera forests. This area of forests is pretty small. If you think about the massive extent of river red gum forests that were all along the river at the time of white settlement, we've got these remnants. The Nyah-Vinifera forest is a remnant; it's only 820 hectares. But it is a much loved and valuable remnant of the much larger river red gum forests that were once there. It is incredibly valued by the local community. Because it's a remnant, it is even more important for its ecological value and for what was once there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This trip was organised for me by a couple of local activists. I want to pay tribute to them in this speech, Jacquie Kelly and Morgana Russell in particular. They wanted me to visit the forest with them so that we could see together what the state of that forest was. We met an orchardist, local farmer and irrigator, Peta Thornton, who is as passionate as Jacquie and Morgana are about the health of the river. She was outraged that her name as an irrigation farmer was being used to justify reducing the level of water that was going into the river. She knew that the health of her business and her community depended upon the health of the river. She knew that without enough water going down the river, her business and the community, as well as the life of the river, were going to suffer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the great privilege of meeting some of the traditional owners from the Wadi Wadi and Wemba Wemba people, in particular Cain Chaplin, a traditional owner who spent an afternoon with us as we walked the forest. It was such a privilege to walk this area of forest with Cain and to be there to see his love for the forest and his connection to the forest, but also to feel his pain of how unhealthy and how stressed that forest is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This river red gum forest needs to be inundated every few years. Because of the efforts of the local communities and massive campaigns, it's now being protected from logging. It's being protected as a regional park. When that occurred, there was great hope that this forest had a chance of being brought back to a healthy situation. But, sadly, even over the last decade, even though the drought has broken, even though we haven't had the dreadful conditions of the millennium drought, this area of forest is under stress. It is not getting the water it requires. It needs to be inundated every couple of years. It's not happening. Every large tree that we looked at, Cain, Jacquie and Morgana said to me, 'Have a look up there.' You could see the dead branches. You could see these trees were under stress. We could think about what the future was going to be like for these forests. You could see dead trees. You knew that more and more of these trees were going to die because they were not getting the inundation they required. This was exactly the sort of issue that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was meant to resolve to make sure that these areas of river red gum forest were healthy. It's not yet working. And what is the government planning on doing? Reducing the level of water that's going to be available to this forest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms that are being proposed, which we are debating tonight, are actually going to mean there is less water available for this area of forest than is currently the case. Even if the project worked, even if every one of them was effective at watering the forest, they are only going to cover approximately 60 per cent of the forest in the Nyah-Vinifera area, leaving 40 per cent aside. That means that 40 per cent of the forest is going to be dying a very sad, tragic death. That's presuming that these sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms actually work. That is something that is absolutely very questionable, because nobody yet knows the details of what the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms are in these forests. Basically, for the local community, the local traditional owners and the local environmentalists, the details of what the adjustment mechanisms are are not yet public. And, as Senator Patrick has just said, they haven't yet got business cases for them. They can't tell them what they are. What they are told is, 'You're going to have a series of levees, locks and weirs.' And that's going to mean that rather than having water flowing into these forests and then flowing out again, it's going to stop that water. The theory is that instead of 'wasting' this water—so-called wasting—and having it flowing through, that inundating this area of forest and having the water sit there for various periods of time will be the same as allowing the water to flow through. This is absolutely questionable—more than questionable. In fact, it is highly unlikely that this is going to be the equivalent of having a natural flood flowing through that forest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's more, whereas we now have an area of forest that is pretty much in its natural state—despite the stress that it's under—an area of forest that is beloved by people from all over Victoria, who come and camp there regularly to be there in that forest, we're going to have levee banks, locks and these massive great concrete structures to hold this water in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The likelihood of those adjustment mechanisms, those actual constructions, meeting the needs of the forest is so small. I can see that we are going to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars on these projects and then, in 10 years time, actually find that they're not working—that we're getting blackwater events because we have this water sitting stagnant rather than flowing through and that, actually, they're not serving the purposes that they set out to do. But, it will be too late then, and too late for the health of the river. That is the issue; that is the focal point of what we are discussing tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard Labor saying that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is back on track. That is a ridiculous assertion. How on earth can they say that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is back on track when there is still so much that's unknown? We're going to spend $1.3 billion on these untested adjustment mechanisms—</span>

                    </a>  That's right! Cutting out 605 billion litres of water. Senator Gallacher talked about improved transparency, where we are being asked to sign off on $1.3 billion worth of projects without having business plans and without knowing that they're going to work. It is just something that is totally unacceptable and something that, for me, concerned about the river—that for us as Greens, concerned about the health of this river and the health of these communities—absolutely cannot acquiesce to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect I think that we need to talk about, going back to my point about the 3,200 gigalitres being an absolute minimum: it is absolutely necessary that we get all of that. Every single gigalitre of that water is needed for the health of the river. That is what the Murray-Darling Basin Plan doesn't actually even consider—the fact that that allocation of water, when it was worked out a decade ago, didn't take into account the impact of climate change. If we look at what's going to happen to flows in the basin with a warming climate, we're going to need a lot more water allocated to the environment than what is being proposed if we're going to keep it healthy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A month ago I was in Swan Hill. Under a scenario of three to four degrees of warming, the climate in Swan Hill is likely to become like the climate of Cobar. These are the sorts of impacts that we are talking about with climate change, and yet we are talking about taking water out of the river! It is just completely unscientific. It is completely irrational. It will just mean that the river will be left a dying, sad vestige of its former health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The river under the plan as proposed—under the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism—is being sold out. The river needs more water, not less. For those of us in this parliament who are concerned about the health of the river, who are concerned about the livelihoods of the people who rely on the river, who are concerned about the livelihoods of the irrigators, who are concerned about the livelihoods of community and who are concerned about the areas like the Nyah-Vinifera forests, a cultural landscape of immense significance to the traditional owners, we cannot agree to these sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms to be passed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243273" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  The announcement this week that the opposition is once again going to join us on the journey to restore health to the Murray-Darling Basin is an absolutely overwhelming relief to the millions and millions of people who rely on this valuable resource for their very livelihoods. Ever since the passage of the Water Act in 2007, the basin has enjoyed bipartisan support in federal parliament, and it would have been an extraordinary situation for the Australian Labor Party to now walk away from this plan, which it delivered in 2012. Our river communities up and down the basin require certainty, and that is what the Senate can unequivocally deliver today for those communities by defeating this disallowance motion. By restoring bipartisan support and commitment to the basin plan we can start the process of restoring the confidence in the plan in the wider community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, if you listen today to Senator Hanson-Young, you would believe that the basin was only minutes away from collapse. Nothing could be further from the truth. No-one is denying that the allegations that were raised of non-compliance were very serious, but by Senator Hanson-Young's own admission most of these issues have already been addressed by the government. She's just spent the last 20 minutes accusing the opposition of gaining nothing in their negotiation with the government, because we had already committed to fixing the problems that have been raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan is a very complex program. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to restore our wonderful river system to health. The plan is on track, and this government is committing to delivering this plan in full. We know the Greens don't support the plan, but, instead of working with us constructively to get the best possible outcome, they instead try to destroy confidence in the plan through misinformation, exaggeration and mischief. But we only have to remember that the only party in this place not to vote for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in 2012 was the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, many in this place agree that the delivery of this plan is absolutely essential and they have indicated that they will not be supporting this disallowance. That's because the sensible money is on the facts, the science based model to deliver a plan that recognises that there are social and economic as well as environmental imperatives that need to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also shouldn't forget that the SDL adjustment mechanism was incorporated in the basin plan in 2012 at the question of all of the basin ministers in all of the states that have the Murray-Darling Basin rivers and tributaries running through them, because they saw the necessity for flexibility in setting water extraction limits into the future. The mechanism was designed specifically to ensure that we didn't take water out of productive use—water out of our river communities—if we could deliver our environmental targets by cleverer means. The SDL adjustment is a legislated once-off opportunity to strike the balance—a good balance, the best possible balance—between the environmental, social and economic outcomes that we all seek to make sure that we have a healthy river system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like the commitments to the Northern Basin Review, the SDL adjustment was part of the package of the basin plan, agreed by all basin jurisdictions and delivered by the then minister, the member for Watson. It allows for up to 605 gigalitres of irrigation water to remain in productive use in the southern basin without compromising the basin plan's environmental outcomes. This provides irrigators with the certainty that they need to get on with what they do best: growing the food that we love to eat and growing the fibre that makes our clothes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SDL adjustment mechanism also provides for the recovery of 450 gigalitres of additional environmental water through efficiency measures with neutral or improved social and economic outcomes. In fact, it was an independent report from Ernst &amp; Young, at the request of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, that analysed and proved that there is a pathway by which we can deliver these efficiency measures. The agreed final package of projects means significant new Commonwealth investment in state led environmental works and other regional SDL offset projects across the Murray, Lower Darling and Murrumbidgee catchments. These include environmental works and projects, and changes to river operational rules that achieve basin outcomes using less water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the constructive and comprehensive approach taken by Senator Patrick and his team in the Centre Alliance in analysing this amendment. I'm sure we will be able to convince him in the next few weeks of the merits of these projects and the package, because the amendment that is before us today is a win for basin communities and it is a win for our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is absolutely committed to working to deliver a healthy and productive future for the Murray-Darling Basin and for the rural communities that depend on it for their livelihoods and their very existence. Disallowance of this amendment would have thrown into question the delivery of the basin plan, an outcome that is bad for the river and a disaster for communities which will have lost the certainty that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has given them and will give them for future generations. The government is very pleased that the opposition has agreed to join with us today to vote against this disallowance.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  As I look around the chamber, I don't think there are any other colleagues looking to make a contribution, so I will sum up the second reading debate and thank colleagues who have spoken. The Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017 will implement an important component of the government's media reform package. We are committed to assisting small and regional publishers through a time when the media landscape is in a state of flux. Traditional revenue models have been fractured and media organisations must adapt to move with their audiences. For smaller and regional publications, this is even more challenging. In this disrupted environment, access to locally relevant factual journalism remains important to develop and maintain strong communities. The government's Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund recognises this need. The $50 million fund will provide grants over three years to eligible media organisations for projects that enable new business models and practices. By doing so, the government will assist these publishers to put themselves on a sustainable commercial footing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that industry is supportive of this bill and that submissions received during the inquiry recognised the merit of developing measures to support Australian civic journalism as well as the particular need to support civic journalism in regional areas. The bill will enable the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, establishing its legislative framework. While the bill is not complex, it must be in place to allow robust design and planning of the fund to be completed so that small and regional publishers can access necessary and timely support for projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity to make some brief comments on the opposition's second reading amendment on sheet 8399. This amendment is so full of dross that it almost shouldn't be dignified with a response—suffice to say that the government won't be supporting that amendment. The government's media reform package was unanimously supported by industry, as colleagues will recall. It has very clearly strengthened the position of Australian media organisations and helped to secure jobs and the future of public interest journalism. Those who sit opposite did oppose these reforms at each stage and have not put forward an alternative proposition to the one which was supported by this parliament. I encourage colleagues to support the bill that is before us so that the government can proceed with calling for applications and that the ACMA can begin assessing applications and distributing these funds to regional and small publishers.</span>

Could the minister please explain why it is that the narrow definition of who is entitled to receive this fund cuts out organisations like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, BuzzFeed and The New Daily simply because they may have a parent body based internationally and how that aligns with this fund being able to be accessed by News Ltd publications, which, of course, have huge reach through the Murdoch empire across the rest of the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should emphasise that just because an organisation is eligible to make an application doesn't mean that it will necessary receive funding, because there is a process to assess applications. But we were very conscious of the need to focus this support on organisations which are based within Australia and are Australian owned. As you would be aware, we do have a number of tests: a primary purpose test around the journalism that they undertake; an Australian residence test, to demonstrate that the organisation is incorporated in Australia; an independence test, to demonstrate that they are not associated with, for example, a union, a political party or an NGO; and a control test, to demonstrate that they are not controlled by an entity which isn't managed by Australians.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you for that clarification. Could the minister explain to the chamber why the government has decided to cut $83 million from the ABC budget, as outlined in the budget last year? The reason that this is important in relation to this issue is that this bill is meant to be looking after and supporting public interest journalism yet, at the same time as giving money to small publishers through an innovation fund in rural and regional areas, we're seeing the government cut funding to our public broadcaster. It's going to make it even harder for the ABC to carry on their good services in rural and regional Australia if they don't have the funding. The government is willing to put money on the table for these rural and small publishers through this innovation fund—notwithstanding their ridiculous ideological blindness to locking out organisations like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian,</span><span style="font-style:italic;">The New Daily</span> and others—but, at the same time, as we learned in last night's budget, they have made a cut to the ABC of $83 million. Could the minister please explain why this cut is being made and how it is going to impact on the delivery of public interest journalism in rural and regional Australia.</span>

In the budget last night, the government did indicate that there would be a pause on the indexation of the ABC's base funding from the next triennium. The funding for the ABC in the current triennium remains intact and that has another year to go. We think, as a government, that it's important that the ABC be the best possible steward that it can be of each taxpayer dollar that it has. We have indicated that we will have an efficiency review which will assist the ABC in that task.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should point out that, in the next triennium, total ABC base funding will be $3.16 billion. The ABC will continue to receive in excess of $1 billion a year. This funding is one of the important underpinnings of the diversity in the Australian media environment and is one of the important supports for civic journalism in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are fully confident that the ABC will be able to discharge its responsibilities to the nation, and particularly to rural and regional Australia. Indeed, in an effort to underscore the importance of the ABC's work in rural and regional Australia, we have legislation before the parliament to put specific reference to their obligations to rural and regional Australia in the ABC Act, which is something that people assume is in their legislation but isn't currently the case. I should acknowledge Senator McKenzie's role in putting that proposition forward in her pre-ministerial incarnation.</span>

I don't think that there is yet to be a public sector organisation that has reached a state of administrative perfection. I don't believe that the ABC have achieved that state. There is scope in all public sector organisations to always strive to be even better stewards of the taxpayer dollar, and that's what I'm sure the ABC will do.</span>

'Efficiencies', of course, is code in Liberal speak for cuts—job cuts, job losses and cuts to people's livelihoods. Journalism jobs will be gone. People's jobs in programming will be gone. People in the administration of the organisation will have their jobs cut and will be gone. Eighty-three million dollars is a big whack out of the public broadcaster. Could the minister outline whether he has had any conversations with the director of the ABC in relation to the impact that this $83 million cut will mean for her organisation?</span>

This is, in the context of the ABC's overall budget, something that is fairly modest. The ABC was aware before budget night that this was to be the case. We, as I mentioned before, are not altering the ABC's funding in the current triennium, which has a year to go, which means that the ABC is well placed to consider its operations in the context of the funding that will be in the next triennium.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  On Anzac Day this year, I went out to Tingha, a large Aboriginal community near Inverell. A lot of the people are Aborigines. I want to talk to you about Charlie Livermore. I will read a story in the paper from October 2005:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With the passing of Claude Charles Livermore (Charlie) on August 8 this year it seems fitting to honour him by sharing his story of remarkable compassion and courage during his time as a PoW. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Aboriginal PoW not only survived three-and-a-half years at Changi, the notorious Japanese prison camp during the war, but through his bravery helped other PoWs to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He gained national recognition for the "Deerstalker" incident, of which most say saved his and others' lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Charlie was born on October 13, 1920, in Bundarra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When WWII broke out, the then 21-year-old wasted no time enlisting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">His wife, Nora Livermore, said he was keen to enlist, but unprepared for the plight that lay ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"He may have even added two years on to his age just so he could go to war," Mrs Livermore said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A member of the doomed 2/18th Battalion, Charlie was captured in Malaya upon arrival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For the next few years as a PoW he demonstrated insurmountable courage and heroism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He learnt Japanese while in prison to help his fellow inmates and gradually Charlie was able to make acquaintances with the guards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"By being able to talk to them, the guards liked him more than the other prisoners, so he could then ask for extra rice," Mrs Livermore said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"They were all thin like African children so Charlie did whatever was necessary, including steal food for his comrades to ensure they did not die as a PoW."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One of the most famous tales among the PoWs at Changi, and indeed throughout Australia today, is the unusual campaign Charlie launched against the Japanese, known as the 'Deerstalker' incident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Being Aboriginal made Charlie a particular victim of "Deerstalkers", Japanese guards unconvinced Australia had native black people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One guard in particular insisted that Charlie was an Indian and beat him severely when he protested his Aboriginality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"There was no such thing as an Aboriginal to the Japanese back then," Mrs Livermore said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After much prompting by his PoW friends, Charlie used the Aboriginal technique of ''pointing the bone' at the "Deerstalker," an Aboriginal tradition that many believe will kill the person the bone is pointed at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The results following Charlie's pointing of the bone were extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Major Doug Okey recorded them in his diary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He wrote: "I have never been quite sure what caused the change in the guard's attitude towards us after that, but change he did."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"The guard sold items to the officers at half price, but it was too late. The bone had been pointed and, sure enough, he was taken off the island on a stretcher and according to eyewitnesses, in great agony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"His death was announced some days later."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Upon his return from the war, Charlie married and produced eight children. His wife said no matter where they went Charlie was respected by everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"People knew Charlie from all over the place and despite his treatment as a PoW, he never once said a bad word about the Japanese," she said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Being a Christian, Charlie believed we were all equal."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">During his final years, Charlie suffered from various war-related diseases, such as chronic bronchitis and nerve damage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But, despite his ill health, daughter Yvonne Kent said he never once missed an Anzac Day celebration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"He was very sick earlier this year but he insisted on getting out of bed. He said, 'I'll see one last Anzac Day'," Mrs Kent said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As one of the elders of the Kamilaroi tribe, Charlie Livermore was respected throughout society and will remain in the hearts and minds of those whose lives he saved and those who he touched through his incredible life story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Tingha at the 11 o'clock service a plaque was unveiled for the 36 or 37 Aborigines who signed up for the war. People there told me about Charlie. He could scavenge through the bush; that was his Aboriginal teaching. So he'd scavenge for food and he'd keep others alive. Prisoners of war relied on him for extra food. It was amazing how he pointed the bone at the terrible Japanese guard. Of course, the guard got very sick and died. What a great Australian was Charlie Livermore. And with all those Aboriginals who went to war, volunteered and were keen to get out there and do their part to protect our country being remembered on a plaque at Tingha this year, I thought it was fitting I talk about Charlie Livermore tonight. May he rest in peace: a great Australian, a great digger, a prisoner of war and a well-respected Aboriginal member of the Tingha community. Rest in peace, Charlie.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise to address the Senate the day after what has, sadly, proven to be another budget for bankers and billionaires. This is a budget where the welfare of everyday Australians is placed squarely behind that of big business, and it places cuts at its centre. This budget places cuts to pensioners; cuts to the energy supplement; and cuts to TAFE, schools and hospitals at its core, and at the same time this is a budget that raises the pension age for working Australians. As we've just heard, there are also cuts to the public broadcaster, the ABC, of which I have to say the minister with some careless disregard uses weasel words as to whether he knew there would be possible job losses due to the cuts to the ABC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does the budget raise the pension age for working Australians; it also fails to adequately address the crisis that it's made in the aged-care sector. At a time when the waiting lists have grown by 20,000 places over a period of just six months, the government is offering 3½ thousand places a year. What an indictment on the priorities of this government and on its ability to act for older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And just why is it that they're proposing these cuts and half-baked measures? Well, the government has decided that it needs to make life harder for pensioners, young people and working Australians because that's how it's going to afford its $80 billion handout to banks and big business. Quite frankly, despite the unpopularity of these measures and despite the clear will of the Australian people, this budget moves to lock in a seven-year plan that asks Australians to trust the government. Apparently Australians are expected to vote for this government two more times before they can expect to see all of the proposed tax cuts put up by the Treasurer last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, the Australian people know better than that. They know better than to vote two more times for a government that announces a budget emergency that it then decides has disappeared overnight. They know better than to vote for a government who can announce cash handouts to banks and big business despite cutting essential services. Frankly, they know better than to vote for a government that says it needs to hike up the Medicare levy to pay for the NDIS and then announces that it was fully funded all along. This is a government that simply can't be trusted, and the Australian people know that. Australians know that this is the same government that stood in the way of the banking royal commission because that's where the Prime Minister's mates are. They know that under this government's watch there's been $117 million worth of cuts to hospitals while there's also been a $7.5 million weekly gift planned for the Commonwealth Bank—all this at the same time as the Prime Minister plans to make Australians work longer than almost anywhere else in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget speaks to just how out of touch this government is. Only a government that doesn't understand the jobs of everyday Australians would plan to give big banks a $17 billion handout at the same time as it plans to ask hardworking Australians to increase the number of years that they work. Only this government would expect struggling Australians to deal with $300 less towards rising power bills and would also ask young people to plan for a future with fewer TAFE opportunities and less funding for hospitals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor is committed to holding this government to account and that's why I rise today to address this budget and to address the failed plans at the core of it. I rise to speak against any plans that place cuts to essential services at their core but place future plans of income tax changes over two elections away. This is a budget for bankers and billionaires and this is a budget that, sadly, does no more than we've come to expect from this government. It's only Labor that can guarantee the continued funding of services that Australians value. It's only Labor that plans budgets that look out for everyday Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  I rise in this adjournment debate to make a contribution on a matter pertaining to one of the main players in the construction and architecture of the budget. It was very interesting to hear the Hon. Mathias Cormann, in an interview with David Speers, express the view:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With the benefit of hindsight we should have gone earlier for this inquiry. I am just explaining to you quite candidly that we were motivated absolutely by doing the right thing, by forming the view, which is a matter of public record that it was time for action rather than for more inquiries. As it turns out, this inquiry has come up with some significant revelations …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the royal commission into banking was inflicted upon this current government by some fair-minded and active people in the government's ranks, it's been very instructive to see how people have dealt with it. The Hon. Mathias Cormann has been portrayed as one of the grown-ups in charge—one of the sensible people, one of the committed people, one of the decent people in the ranks of the coalition. But I decided to go back and do a little bit of scrutiny of this particular issue. And when we go back and do some scrutiny of this issue we find that there was a Senate inquiry—because these issues are not new.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Bernie Ripoll and former senator Mark Bishop inquired into these issues and made particularly relevant statements on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. I think it would be pretty instructive to read some of them into the record. The Hon. Bernie Ripoll said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When it comes to opt in, it is one of the few mechanisms that is available to us if you believe in standards, if you believe in changing culture and best interests. It is one of the few ways that you can actually help the sector. The majority of them actually contact their clients on a regular basis, not once every two years, but on a regular basis: once a month, once every three months, once every six months. We think it is quite reasonable to say at least once every two years make contact. At least do something for the clients, because—you know what?—it is not for free; you are actually charging people fees. If you are going to do that we say do it and do it properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on in the same contribution to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So who benefits? I just say: follow the money and have a look at who is involved and who benefits. The four major banks, and AMP, control 80 per cent of the finance advice business in Australia. Good luck to them. But they should not, at the same time, be in concert with the government trying to diminish the good protection measures for consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then take former senator Mark Bishop's contribution:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If the legislation foreshadowed by Senator Cormann is introduced, is passed and becomes law, who wins? We know who the winners are. They are the four banks I named and AMP, commission-based salespeople and retailers of financial products who persuade banks to recommend to customers the sale of their particular product …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there we have it: this is not a new issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Senator the Hon. Mathias Cormann to actually say he's surprised at any of this defies credulity; it really does. It is a case of appearing in the open saying one thing and doing completely the opposite, because he actually recommended against the opt-in provisions. He worked tirelessly to delay the introduction of the opt-in provisions. We know the great tragedy of that is that a deceased customer was charged for financial advice for 10 years. Was that the outcome he was trying to seek? I could give him the benefit of the doubt and say no, but that's what happened. It is a matter of public record. He says he was surprised and that with hindsight he would have done something different, when all the time in the parliament he was working on behalf of the four big banks and the AMP and all those people who have now had their positions completely exposed—where almost the entire board of a major institution in Australia is going to be changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be fair dinkum: in the parliament you can say one thing and do another, because our Minister for Finance has done it. And he pays no penalty for it, despite the fact that a number of very competent journalists—Ian Verrender from the ABC, Peter Martin from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span>—are consistently articulating the absolute incoherence of the government's position of saying they are looking after consumers when they're doing exactly the opposite, all to attack industry super funds. It's disgraceful!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise tonight to place on record my utter dismay at the Western Australian state government's forced and completely unnecessary closure of Moora Residential College. It is a shocking and completely inexcusable decision. I believe, as I know everybody in this chamber believes, that all children deserve to have the same educational opportunities, no matter where they live. All children should have the opportunity to live for as long as possible with their parents or as close as we can make it to their parents. For 35 years, Moora Residential College has provided for children who live too far away from an appropriate senior high school a school where they can access good-quality education as near as possible to their homes and families. This college and similar colleges have allowed these children and their families to keep living and working in regional Australia. The college also is a vital part of the Moora township, supporting local businesses and other community activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very sadly—and I think the only way I can describe it is as an act of complete ideological bastardry—the Western Australian Labor government have decided to close the college by the end of this year, supposedly as a cost-cutting measure. They claim it will save the budget $8.7 million because the school would need an upgrade were it to remain open. That is the only reason. Granted the school does need some further upgrades to its facilities, but it would cost absolutely nowhere near the estimated $8.7 million that the Labor state government have claimed. In fact, Moora college said that they can access the work in the local community at a cost of $500,000. So I don't think there is any reason to seek to close the college, particularly if it can be done for $500,000. So $500,000 is all that is needed for the state Labor government to keep Moora college open, a figure that comes from the last costed maintenance report in 2012 plus one year's operational deficit funding. It is inconceivable it could have gone up so much from 2012 to 2017, particularly when the cost of construction in Western Australia has declined significantly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moora were presented with their cheque for the upgrades in August 2016, with works expected to commence in March this year. But, in December last year, completely inexcusably and inexplicably, the WA Minister for Education, Sue Ellery, declared Moora college would be closed. She cancelled the cheque. She did not consult with the community and nor has she, Premier Mark McGowan, Treasurer Ben Wyatt or the Minister for Regional department, Alannah MacTiernan, even bothered to visit the facility they are arbitrarily closing. They have ignored the community protests. They have ignored the impassioned pleas that they want to stay at the college from students who are currently doing their ATARs. The students want to stay near their families and they want the college to stay open. Those members have not even had the courage to go and look those children and their families in the eye and say why they are closing it and to listen to their stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Moora community, to their enduring credit, have fought very hard against this decision, and they have been very well supported by my state and federal Liberal colleagues. In particular, I would like to note and pay tribute to the federal member for Durack, Melissa Price, who has been tireless in her advocacy for these children and their families. It is a decision that has utterly devastated a community and, again, for $500,000, it is entirely unnecessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that to the former WA education minister, Peter Collier, who had the exact same proposal from the department for education cuts in 2013 when he was the then minister. He was then faced with axing the jobs of 4,000 teachers, but he said no to the department. Sadly, the current minister has said yes and, again, hasn't even had the courage to go and talk to those children and families and explain this decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the hallmarks, I think, of good leadership for politicians is the ability to recognise your mistakes and have the courage, personality and leadership qualities to say, 'I was wrong,' and to fix it. The WA state government have indicated they were capable of correcting their mistakes when they backed down from their equally disastrous decision to axe the School of the Air. It is time to do the same again. Closing Moora college is a terrible mistake that is having far-reaching consequences for the students, their families and the community. I call on the state government Labor government to fix their mistake and reinstate and keep Moora college. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I rise to speak tonight about the importance of recognising our veterans and all those who put their lives on the line fighting at the behest of the Australian government in conflicts around the world. The Greens and I and many others in the community often oppose the wars that our government chooses to send our soldiers to. We certainly oppose this government's spending of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to expand Australia's role as a global arms trader but we—and I think all Australians, frankly, across the board—do want to see those people who are part of those conflicts from Australia when they do return here being properly cared for. If we look at the large amounts of money that are spent on commemorations and memorials, we can look at how much better it would be for those that are still alive today if they got better support and a better deal from the Department of Veterans' Affairs in many cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to also explicitly draw attention to the many people who supported and, indeed, saved the lives of Australian service personnel in the conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan who were originally from those lands and who acted as interpreters. Whilst I have never been part of such battlefields, of course, I don't think it takes much imagination to recognise that such work was very dangerous and made those people even more of a target in their own homelands. It is to be commended that this government and previous governments have brought a number of people who served as interpreters assisting Australian Defence personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq here to Australia and I acknowledge that effort, but I do believe we have an ongoing obligation to those people once they have come here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to call on the still relatively new Minister for Veterans Affairs, Mr Chester, to look at the case of these people who served as translators, who clearly were in perilous, dangerous and traumatic situations because they were removed from their homeland with their families at very short notice, taken away from there—many of them never to return—and settled here. I think most are now Australian citizens. It is great we have given that opportunity to them. But many of them, not surprisingly, have ongoing health issues, particularly with trauma and stress, and they are not getting access to the same sort of treatment that we would expect our former Defence personnel to receive. I am sure, and in fact I know—because I have seen the correspondence from past attempts at advocacy for these people to get proper support and assistance through the normal Veterans' Affairs mechanisms—that they were given all of the technicalities in the world as to why they weren't officially Australian Defence Force personnel. Some were under the command of the UK or the US and maybe, in terms of the actual wording of the rules and regulations, that is true. But I would ask the government and the minister to re-examine and change those rules and regulations so these people can get assistance and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand we are talking about perhaps 600 people around Australia. There is a group of at least 60 of them from Iraq who are living in Queensland at the moment, and I met with about a dozen of them at the Darra RSL in Brisbane a few months back. These are people that march on Anzac Day. These are people who are supported by the RSL there locally and recognised as returned service personnel who supported Australia in the theatre of war. I join with the calls of the RSL in Queensland for the government to consider providing proper help and support to these men. I wrote to the new minister back in March, calling on him to look at this situation again with fresh eyes, and I urge him once again to do so and to hear the support from so many Australian Defence personnel, who realise the role that these people play. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside that, I also join with Captain Jason Scanes, who lives in Maryborough now, who has continued to campaign for five years for his interpreter from Afghanistan to get protection. He is one who hasn't been able to get protection from the Australian government. I know the minister has said he will review that case. I would urge him to do so as promptly as possible and get that person to a place of safety here in Australia forthwith.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  A number of Tamils and Muslims living in Sydney have approached me about ongoing violence that their communities in Sri Lanka are experiencing. In March this year—this is relevant; it is a story linking what is happening in Australia to what is going on in Sri Lanka—a Tamil asylum seeker family suddenly was whisked away from their home at dawn for deportation by Australian Border Force officers. The family had been living and working in Biloela in Queensland for about three years. The reports I received told me that they were very well liked and very much part of their community. A candlelight vigil was held to protest against their deportation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The deportation of Tamil refugees from Australia back to Sri Lanka is now not uncommon. We do need to link it with what is going on in Sri Lanka, because the basis of these deportations is that the Sri Lankan government has assured the international community that all refugees are safe to return. That's a lie. It's a clear lie. Tamil refugees continue to be in grave danger of harassment, imprisonment and worse when they return. According to a report by Amnesty International, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was not repealed, despite repeated promises by the Sri Lankan government, and it continues to be used to detain and arrest Tamils suspected of links with the LTTE, often referred to as the Tamil Tigers. Torture and other ill-treatment in police custody is rife. During his visit to Sri Lanka, the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms stated that over 100 unconvicted prisoners remained in detention under the PTA, some of whom had been held like that for over a decade. Torture and other ill-treatment is routine and practised throughout the country, mainly by the police. Sri Lanka is not a safe country to which Tamil refugees who have sought assistance in this country should be returned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Threats and physical violence are also made against other minority groups. Christians and Muslims are being targeted by supporters of the hardline Sinhala-Buddhist political group, and reports also show that police regularly fail to take action when they are called. In March, multiple reports identified violence against Muslims in the eastern province. It spread to Kandy and suburbs. Lives were lost and great damage was caused to mosques, homes and businesses belonging to minority Muslims. They lost millions of rupees in these attacks. This violence also is being reported as coming for a small group of extremist fundamental Buddhists. I understand that the security forces sent to restore peace regularly just stand by and take little action. It appears that they make no attempt to prevent the violence or to identify and arrest the perpetrators. This is simply unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is clear. The government of Sri Lanka appears to be captive to this powerful group of Buddhist extremists. They are intent on attacking the rights of minority religious groups and other groups in Sri Lanka. We shouldn't be fooled by the continuing reassurances of the Sri Lankan government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent report by the International Truth and Justice Project calls attention to the recent deployment of members of the Sri Lankan Special Task Force, the STF, a paramilitary unit of the Sri Lankan police—as UN peacekeepers. The report notes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The violations described in this report speak to an amoral attitude to the taking of life and to human dignity, and where dehumanisation has become institutionalised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet many of the people now known to have committed war crimes with substantial evidence are being sent overseas as peacekeepers to trouble spots. We are talking about systematic and documented abductions from the streets of Colombo, torture, rape, sexual violence, extrajudicial killings and also wholesale massacres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these people are the same people who were never held to account by the Sri Lankan government for their war crimes, despite the United Nations' UNHCR Resolution 30/1, in which the government of Sri Lanka committed to accountability, including the thorough vetting of public and security officials. But now we have this shocking situation where STF officers are taking peacekeeping roles in Africa and elsewhere, often with rewards for their service and often, tragically, continuing to commit crimes and abuse human rights. The Australian government has a responsibility to investigate.</span>
