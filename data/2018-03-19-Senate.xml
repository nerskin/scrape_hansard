                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Right now we are witnessing the end of an era. The sun is setting on the coal empire and we are transitioning to a new future powered by renewable energy. It's an exciting future, but it's well past overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been doing everything it can to slow this country's transition to renewable energy, and Australians are bearing the brunt of their failure. In the last few days, we've seen bushfires savage Tathra, Bega and south-west Victoria. We've seen a cyclone hit Darwin. In Tathra, we heard this morning that 70 homes and other buildings have been destroyed. Four people were treated for smoke inhalation and one RFS volunteer was injured. By all accounts, we are very lucky that more people were not hurt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home region of south-west Victoria, 18 homes have been destroyed around the towns of Terang, Garvoc, Camperdown and Gazette; 40,000 hectares have been burnt and farmers have lost their livestock. I know a bit about this part of the world because it's where I live. It's where my family lives and it's where my community is. In our everyday lives we are seeing climate change have an impact on the risk of bushfires to our communities, and we can't any longer be complacent about bushfires once the end of summer comes around. Right now we would normally be talking about the end of the bushfire season, and yet here we are with bushfires ravaging my home state and, indeed, my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia they are now calling their autumn a 'second summer'. And on the other side of the country, in the Top End, Cyclone Marcus has rolled through Darwin and, according to forecasters, it was the strongest storm to hit Darwin in 30 years. The impact has closed schools, it's shut down the public service and cut off electricity to tens of thousands of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know that it's not just Australia that is feeling the impact. To pick one of many disturbing recent events, the Arctic has just experienced an unprecedented heatwave, forcing scientists to reconsider even their most pessimistic forecasts of climate change. Temperatures in Siberia were as much as 35 degrees Celsius above historical averages. I'll say that again: 35 degrees above historical averages. Greenland experienced three times as many hours above freezing than usual. We are seeing extremes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In spite of this overwhelming evidence of the impact of climate change, what we're seeing is a Turnbull government dangerously wedded to coal. It's pushing against the tide of clean energy and all the benefits that brings. As we transition to a renewable energy future, we'll no longer be contributing to dangerous global warming as we generate and use electricity. It is that simple. We can start making this transition now. The good news is it brings so many other benefits to our community. By moving away from coal and taking advantage of clean, green renewable energies, we won't be emitting toxic chemicals like mercury and sulphur dioxide anymore. These are the poisonous gases that our communities inhale when we mine and burn coal. We know that coal has serious health impacts. We know that it leads to respiratory disease, it leads to heart disease, it leads to the development of some cancers and it leads to low birth weight in babies. There are so many good reasons to move away from dirty, polluting coal to clean, renewable energy that are beyond the advantages we get when we move to cleaner sources of energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there is the question of reliability. We won't be relying on unreliable, old coal-fired power stations that don't do the job in extremes of hot weather. Let's look at the facts. We've heard a lot questions about South Australia, but let's look at the facts of what happened this summer. During heatwaves in New South Wales last year, Liddell Power Station was unable to perform because two of its generator units failed to switch on due to unforeseen boiler tube leaks. On New Year's Day, Millmerran Power Station in Queensland stalled. One of the coal-fired power stations there stalled, taking out 156 megawatts from the National Electricity Market. In January, one of the four units of Victoria's Loy Yang A Power Station broke down, taking out another 230 megawatts. We could go on and on, but suffice to say we know that coal-fired power stations can't be relied upon to deliver power in extremes of weather.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are old stations, well past their use-by date, and we know that it is now cheaper to build a new solar farm or more wind turbines than it is to build a new coal-fired power station. For years we've heard from the Turnbull and Abbott governments about the dangers of so-called intermittent renewable energy. They deceitfully blamed power outages in South Australia on renewables after wild storms, when the real cause of the blackout was downed poles and wires. It was a problem with transmission, not generation. That's just one of the many examples of the Liberal and National parties' denialist anti-renewable energy ideology. It also saw them spend obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars on the National Wind Farm Commissioner, for example, to listen to a range of debunked claims about the medical impacts, amongst other things, of wind farms. Imagine if that money had been spent in more renewable energy generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, disappointingly for the government and their cabal of deniers, we know that when coal-fired power stations fail, it's not other coal stations that come to the rescue; it is renewable energy that manages to bridge the gap. When Loy Yang shut down without warning on 14 December last year, taking out 560 megawatts and putting the whole electricity network in danger, it was South Australia's big new Tesla battery that sprang into action to help save the day. It is renewable energy that is meeting the shortfall that occurs when coal-fired power no longer operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the coal industry is in structural decline. No-one in the private sector is building new coal-fired power stations anymore. It does not stack up economically in this day and age. We know the environment arguments are clear, but so too are the economic arguments. No-one is interested in investing billions of dollars into a giant coal-fired power station that we won't want to switch on in a few years' time. No-one wants to do it. No-one is interested in sinking capital investment into an ageing technology when the cost of renewables is plummeting. Investing in coal is about as sensible as investing in dial-up internet: there is no argument for it and the technology has moved ahead of it. Yet we have this government desperately clinging to the past—to the electricity equivalent of fax machines and typewriters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen our Treasurer wave coal around in parliament in a desperate bid to try and make it more popular. We've seen the minister for trade and also the then minister for resources, Barnaby Joyce, spruik Adani's dirty, great big coalmine to Chinese financiers. Most recently, we saw the returned minister for resources, Senator Canavan, talking about how Australia's coal is more beautiful than Donald Trump's coal. What sort of competition is that? It's not one we want to be part of. It doesn't get more farcical than what we've seen played out on the floor of this parliament over recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of renewables is plummeting. That's a good news story and something we should be embracing. If the Turnbull government had any vision, it would be positioning Australia to take advantage of this energy revolution that is sweeping across the rest of the world. We have so many natural advantages here. We live in one of the sunniest, windiest places in the world. We have abundant space. We have the technological expertise. We could be leading the charge, but instead we are an international laggard dragging our heels behind so much of the developed world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I thought we'd hit rock bottom when we saw the Prime Minister pressuring a private company, AGL, into prolonging the life of that decrepit, old coal-clunker Liddell. Liddell is something that's more at home in 1960s Soviet Russia than it is in a modern 21st century economy. Liddell is falling apart. It's hanging together with spit and string. AGL knows that it's a dud investment. It doesn't want to throw good money after bad in keeping it open. The company itself has said that it would have to invest nearly a billion dollars to keep it open for an extra five years, which would push up the cost of its output to around $106 per megawatt hour. This is the market responding to a Prime Minister who wants us to turn the clock back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AGL now has a plan to replace Liddell with 1.6 gigawatts of renewables, plus storage and a range of other technologies, yet the Turnbull government and its state cronies are talking about dipping into the public purse to help Liddell stay open for another few years. It should be illegal to use public money in this way. Taxpayer dollars—dollars that belong to everybody—should be spent on investing in the things that we know are the foundations of a decent society: public health care and hospitals; public education and schools; and science and research. It should be spent on doing something about the growing gap between the rich and poor—reducing inequality—and ensuring everybody gets access to a social safety net and a decent education. We should be spending our hard-earned dollars on securing a long-term energy future that's based in renewables. We should be investing in the public interest, not on a handout that will burn our planet and make climate change worse. That's why it should be illegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017 prohibits the Commonwealth from providing financial support to refurbish, or indeed to build, a coal-fired power station. It also prevents the Commonwealth from purchasing or assisting with the purchase or transfer of ownership of a coal-fired power station. The bill does make sure that the government can provide public money to transition affected workers into new industries and that it can use public money to manage the closure of a coal-fired power station. This is a transition that is happening and that will happen, despite this government trying to slow it down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a choice. We can look after those workers in those industries and manage this transition in a way that ensures that their future is looked after as well, or we can leave them to the vagaries of the market, not manage the transition, and see workers left on the scrap heap. It is the Greens that want a just transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that no major financial institution wants to fund coal. Our experience with the Adani coalmine has made that abundantly clear. They simply can't find the finance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government needs to listen to the science, listen to what the economics are telling us and listen to what the rest of the world is saying. Coal is obsolete; it has no long-term future, and we need to invest in those things that do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we still don't know where the ALP sits on this issue. We certainly know where the Liberal and National parties do; we know that, for them, it's coal all the way. But we know that the Labor Party is also beholden to those vested interests in the fossil fuel industry—it takes major donations from the fossil fuel industry. We know that there's a revolving door between the parliament, for former members—Liberal, National and Labor—and their staffers, and big coal. That revolving door between parliament and the coal industry has never swung faster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we have a plan. We want Australia to run on 100 per cent renewable energy. We're proud of that fact. We have a plan to transition workers from coal communities into the jobs of the future. We want to ensure that people are looked after. We will re-regulate electricity prices to bring costs down and provide much-needed relief to Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all members of this place—and, in particular, the ALP and the crossbench—to show some courage in supporting this bill. This is our opportunity to stake what it means to have a long-term future for future generations. This is our opportunity to say: 'The past is the past, and we understand what a 21st-century modern economy looks like. It's one that's powered by renewable energy. It's one that looks after people. It's one that ensures that, in any transition, no matter how difficult, those workers are looked after.' This is an opportunity for the Labor Party and the crossbench to take a stand against the dangerous Turnbull government's obsession with coal, and to ensure that we lay out a clear path for this nation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  The Greens political party have been called many things, but, clearly, they are now a party in denial. If ever you'd wanted to know why the voters of Tasmania and South Australia and Batman have at last turned against the Greens, you've had a classic example now, with that speech of denial from the current Greens leader in the Senate. Fifteen years ago, when the Greens parties in Europe started to fail, I predicted then that the Greens political party in Australia would, not long after, follow suit. Following the result, even in Tasmania, can I say, and then even in South Australia, which used to be the Greens heartland at one stage, and now of course in Batman, the voters of Australia have eventually woken up to the hypocrisy and fraud of the Greens political party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me start by asking Senator Di Natale, or any of the Greens speakers who might speak in this debate, this question I always ask and can never get an answer to from the Greens. According to the Greens, Australia's emissions of carbon are what's causing global climate change. I repeat that. This is the Greens' claim, and you've just heard Senator Di Natale say that: what Australia emits in carbon is why the world's climate is changing. It is an incontestable fact that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. You can shut Australia down completely, stop our emissions totally, which in world figures is 1.4 per cent, but what impact will that have on the changing climate of the world? Don't listen to my answer; listen to the answer of Australia's Chief Scientist who, when asked that question, said, 'virtually none.' Yet Senator Di Natale has spent 20 minutes trying to confuse the dwindling band of supporters of the Greens political party that somehow it's Australia's fault, and if we open up the Adani coalmine that is going to cause greater cyclones, huge floods and snow storms around the world. The Greens are completely hypocritical, and completely fraudulent, when it comes to this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even Senator Di Natale started off by saying the storm in Darwin is the biggest storm ever for the last 30 years, and that's the same with everything. The floods in Brisbane a few years ago were the biggest floods in Queensland since 1927. Cyclone Yasi was the biggest cyclone ever to hit Australia since 1918. These events have happened before, they will happen in the future, and nothing Senator Di Natale says will change that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask Senator Di Natale to tell me how you and your Labor Party mates—well, you used to be mates—think by doing something in Australia we're going to stop world climate change? I'm fascinated to hear how, with 1.4 per cent of emissions, something we do in Australia is going to save the world. It is just nonsensical. It's a question I keep asking and no-one from the Greens political party has ever even attempted to answer the question on how Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon, can possibly have any effect on the changing climate. Sure, when the rest of the world—the other 98.5 per cent of emitters—reduce their carbon emissions, then Australia should do something as well. But until then why are we destroying Australian jobs—the jobs of Australian workers? I used to think the CFMEU and the Labor Party were interested in them, but they are clearly not anymore. They go for the Greens' ideology, and I hope after Batman the Labor Party will at last realise that the Greens' message is failing and failing rapidly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Please can someone from the Greens political party or the Labor Party, who seem to subscribe to this foolish fantasy, tell me how Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is affecting world climate change?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale says renewables are the way to go. Certainly the government's position is that it is technology neutral for investment in the energy sector, and we've introduced legislation to remove the prohibition on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation from providing finance to carbon capture and storage projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will point out to the Senate, and anyone who might be listening to this, that in all the world agreements on reduction in emissions Australia is one of the few countries in the world that has actually met all of its targets. It's done it mainly under Liberal governments by cleverly managing the economy, but not destroying jobs, and particularly not destroying the futures of other countries. Senator Di Natale rails in one breath against the Indian company Adani—there seems to be a bit of a racial tone to the accusations against Adani—and then in the next breath he will say how the Greens political party is always looking after those poor people around the world. Yet here is the chance for the poor people in India to get the electricity that Senator Di Natale has been using for the last 50 years —I might say it is coal-fired power electricity. Why do we deprive the poor people of India of that opportunity? And that's what the Adani project is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have unlimited reserves of high-quality, low-emission black coal in the Central Queensland area, where I come from, which is there to be exported to India, to establish new coal-fired power stations, to give the people of India the very limited luxury of electricity, which they don't have now. Senator Di Natale and the Greens would deny the Indian people this opportunity. The Indian people will get coal-fired power stations because they need it for their country to progress, but they'll get dirty coal from Indonesia and other places. They could get coal from Australia—a cleaner power, a cleaner coal—and that would bring jobs to Australians and help the Indian people. Yet, the Greens will never answer my question. I challenge anyone to come back to me in the hundreds of times I've asked this question in this chamber: how is it that Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the carbon emissions of the world, is going to affect climate change? I know I'm repeating myself, but I will keep saying this until the people of Australia—all of them—understand that it is not Australia's doing. Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent, and even the most revered scientist in the world—Australia's Chief Scientist—in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> in answer to my question: 'What impact would it have if we reduce Australia's emissions by 1.4 per cent?', answered: 'Virtually none.' This just shows the fraud and hypocrisy of the Greens political party and the voters of Australia are at last waking up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale talks about clean, green renewables. We all like that but, of course, when the sun stops shining and the wind stops blowing, how do we get power? The South Australian former government, the Labor government, had a great idea. They were going to turn on all these diesel fired generators, hundreds of diesel fired generators polluting the Australian atmosphere. It just shows the absolute hypocrisy and stupidity of the argument of the Greens political party and, I might say, their mates in the Labor Party on this. Sure, you have to have a mix, and under the Turnbull government we are getting that mix. We are encouraging renewables where they work and we are encouraging other forms of energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I'm old, but I remember the time when Australia's main competitive advantage in this world was that we had cheap power, because we are blessed with high-quality coal. It was that cheap power that in the fifties and sixties burst Australia to the head of the world economies. Now, unfortunately, because of the actions of the Labor Party, I have to say, more than the Greens political party, that is coming into difficulty. Senator Di Natale says Adani can't get money for their project. I don't know how he knows that—quite frankly, I don't either—but I suspect they do have the money. But why would you invest in any project in Australia? One government, the Liberal government in Canberra, and the Labor government in Queensland have said: 'Yes, this coal project in Central Queensland can go ahead, providing all these environmental conditions are met. it provides jobs for Indigenous people there. Yes, it can all go ahead.' So you invest your money and start the project on the basis of approvals given by the state Labor government and the federal Liberal government, and then Mr Shorten, to win votes in Batman, comes along and says, more or less: 'It doesn't matter what's happened in the past. If you invest your money, I'm going to introduce federal legislation to stop it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would you invest in a project when you have a government—an alternative government, I might say—saying to the world, 'It doesn't matter what the current governments, including the Labor one in Queensland, say; if I get into power I'm going to stop Adani, after they've invested all this money.' If you ever wanted a way of chasing investment in all of its forms away from Australia, you only have to look at Mr Shorten's stupidity in the recent Batman by-election. He was so keen to win that seat from the Greens that he just said anything that he thought might attract a few of the loony Greens voters over to his party, and he succeeded in that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in doing that, what's he done to the workers—the coal workers and the mining workers of Queensland, the state that I represent, the people up my way? The people of Townsville are looking to the Adani project, a project of billions and billions of dollars, to kickstart the economy of the Townsville region and the North and to provide literally thousands of jobs for CFMEU members—well, people who would be CFMEU members, although we know the statistics: the number of people joining unions these days has plummeted to nine per cent of the private workforce; only nine per cent join the unions. Why? Because the union they thought was looking after them—the construction, mining and forestry union—has sided with Labor and the Greens to deny them jobs in the mines, for no purpose. As I've demonstrated, it's not going to make one iota of difference to climate change. All it does is send Australia's jobs offshore and make our energy bill much higher than it should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy and lack of truth and rigor in the Greens' speech is demonstrated by Senator Di Natale's comment that 'No-one's building coal-fired power stations these days.' Well, sorry: in China there's about one new coal-fired power station built every week. And in India there are coal-fired power stations being built all the time. Even in Germany these days there is a new interest in coal-fired power stations. Why? Because with carbon capture and storage, with these new HELE plants, you can have the benefits of coal and affordable energy at the same time as grabbing particulates and other elements from coal that aren't as useful to the world as they should be. So, again, you've got to understand that the Greens are in denial. After the last awful couple of weeks that they've had, I can well understand that. But clearly the Australian voters have woken up to the hypocrisy, the stupidity and the outright lies of the Greens political party and have deserted the Greens in droves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of very positive action has been taken by the Turnbull government, and all credit to Mr Josh Frydenberg, the energy and environment minister, and Matt Canavan, the resources minister, led by our Prime Minister. We are taking a balanced and sensible look at Australia's energy needs. Under the Greens political party, now supported by the Australian Labor Party, power prices for ordinary Australians are skyrocketing through the roof. Yet we have this unlimited supply of high-quality coal in central Queensland, near where I live, which is readily available to give Australia that competitive advantage that it had in years gone by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I'm being repetitive, but I want to again demonstrate this. I want to ask anybody from the Labor Party or the Greens political party to tell me how anything we do in Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is going to affect the changing climate of the world, assuming, as I do, that carbon emissions do have some impact on climate change—although I acknowledge I'm not one who gets into this debate, because I am not a scientist and I don't understand it, but I do know that equally qualified scientists have very divergent views on this same subject. But even accepting that carbon emissions have an impact on climate change, I asked this question of the Greens political party. I must have a look in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, because I think I've asked this same question 100 times and, would you believe, never once has there been an answer. You don't have to be terribly bright—and I'm not terribly bright—you just need to have a little bit of common sense: Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions and, according to the Chief Scientist, even if we stop that completely—that is, shut down every car, turn off every light and stop any use of Australia's principal source of energy, which is coal-fired power—it would have, to quote the Chief Scientist, 'virtually no' impact on the changing climate of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do I think that perhaps today, after the flogging the Greens have received in the ballot box in the last few weeks, I will get an answer to that question? I suspect not. The Greens will continue in denial of the facts, of the truth of these matters, of the absolute common sense. The Greens want to reduce Australia's emissions by 50 or 80 per cent—I don't know what it is—but even if you reduce it by 100 per cent not one iota of difference would it make to the changing climate of this world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, which seeks to prohibit forever investment in coal-fired power stations, is just another loony lefty creation of a party not only in great denial but in steep decline in voter support. I'm delighted to say that my fellow Australians have eventually woken up to the hypocrisy, the lack of truth, the outright lies of the Greens political party and I am sure that they, like a lot of their theories, will be confined to the dustbin of history, and the sooner that happens, the better for Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I feel as though I've heard this debate many times and I think we'll find some of the allegations and cross-allegations listed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> over and over again over at least the last 10 years. Labor has long recognised that Australia needs to transition to clean forms of electricity generation. Our ministers in previous governments Greg Combet and Tony Burke, and now the shadow minister, Mr Mark Butler in the other place, have argued consistently that we do need to have a strong commitment to renewable energy. We have a strong set of policies, which are all on the record, which talk about why we need to have a commitment to achieve 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. That's consistent with the commitments and statements we made under the Paris accord. That is clear. We understand that we have to move energy production in this country. We need to work with community, with science, and with people in this place to ensure we don't have statements like we just heard, which completely debunk any kind of positive discussion or argument about how we can make this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise the importance of ensuring this transition is a just one. We talk so much about the fact that we need to work with communities—particularly the communities that Senator Macdonald I think referred to in his contribution—that have been relying on the coal industry for over a century. You cannot make decisions about our community without engaging with them and ensuring that we have a just transition. We won't let coal power workers and communities be left behind, as we, a parliament, a government, actually tackle climate change. The inevitability of this transition is recognised. Finally, I think, we can say together that the inevitability of the transition is recognised by the energy industry and, as a result, the planned and managed phase-out of coal-fired power is something the industry accepts and includes in its forward plans. The head of the Australian Energy Council, Mr Matthew Warren, has previously said that new coal-fired power stations in Australia are 'uninvestable', a view held widely by companies and put about clearly in the finance sector. Put simply, the debate about what Australia's energy future looks like has really been won not in this place but in corporate boardrooms and communities across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's energy future is one that is increasingly renewable, increasingly flexible, increasingly distributed and increasingly high tech. We are never going to go back to the old 20th century model of a central coal plant and passive customers; even if we try to put our climate change obligations to one side, which I believe I've heard debated in this place, we mustn't, we shouldn't and we won't. The fact is that renewable energy is the cheapest form of new electricity generation, and storage and energy management technologies are seeing advances and cost reductions that mean a reliable, affordable renewable energy system is well within Australia's grasp.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current debate about energy policy isn't about a coal-fired future versus a renewables future. Though I believe that debate will continue to happen in this place, that is not the real debate. We must have a renewables future. The real debate is really about a well-managed transition versus a transition that is chaotic and costly, which is what the approach of the Turnbull government is delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That does not mean that Labor are supporting the bill that's before this place this morning, the Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017. We don't believe that it's a sensible bill. We don't believe that it actually engages in the debate we need to have. The debate we should be having in this place includes the questions: how can the transition to clean energy be best managed? What policy framework best delivers a clean energy future whilst safeguarding reliability and affordability—that is, not denying that affordability and reliability can occur but actually safeguarding reliability and affordability? What must governments, at every level, do to ensure coal power workers and their communities see and are part of a bright and prosperous future? How can we ensure that renters and those in community and social housing can access the benefits of solar and battery systems?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also talk, in this place and in our communities, about how we are going to be part of the ongoing international discussion that is clearly outlined in the sustainable development goals—the sustainable development goals that our nation, with many others, signed on to with great protestations of faith two years ago. At least four of these goals are a core part of this debate and what we should be talking about in this place. We have goal 7: affordable and clean energy. That's what this debate is about—affordability and clean energy. It's also about industry, innovation and infrastructure: working with the people who have the skills, the ability and the finance to make sure we have the infrastructure, the innovation and the science that will ensure we have the strong, clean renewable energy future we must have. We must also talk about sustainable cities and communities—that is, ensuring strong, secure and effective energy processes so that people are not struggling, on a daily basis, with energy costs. We also need to have responsible consumption and production. Nothing is more central to this debate than responsible consumption and production—again, understanding the importance and the essential nature of energy in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Goal 13 is climate action. I do believe that any debate about whether there is a link between carbon emissions and climate action should be over, though every now and then you hear echoes in this place about whether it is still open for debate. We know that there are people in the parliament that will continue to deny, continue to say that there is no link. Even if they don't understand the science, they believe that even if Australia took action it wouldn't make any difference, so why should we do anything? We have very clearly the partnerships for the goals for it to actually come together. These things provide the framework about which we can put our debate, about which we can make our policies and how we can bring communities along with us, so it's not just Australia involved in this debate but that it's debated internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are things in the bill we've got before us that overstep the mark. In their enthusiasm, the people who drafted the bill have been caught up into debates that are not really clear. The bill is not carefully worded. Its full consequences can't be known. The bill states that the Commonwealth must not provide financial or other support in connection with the refurbishment of coal-fired power stations. What does that exactly mean? Does it include the processing of approvals and licences or other regulatory processes? Does it include public research funding through universities or the wonderful CSIRO into technologies that might be used in connection with a future coal-fired plant refurbishment to reduce carbon emissions? What about the carbon price?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though the Greens voted with the Abbott Liberal opposition against Labor's carbon pricing scheme in 2009, they claim that they do support a carbon price. You must know that a carbon price provides a financial incentive for the refurbishment of coal-fired power plants to lower their carbon emissions and carbon pollution. Would this bill that's saying that there shouldn't be any engagement in this way make a carbon price unlawful because it would provide other Commonwealth support for the refurbishment of coal-fired power plants? The bill says the Commonwealth must not assist the transfer of ownership of a coal-fired power station. How about the regulatory processes that may be triggered by a purely private transfer of ownership? Is this bill saying that the usual regulatory functions of government should not apply to coal-fired power stations, simply because of the emission intensity of coal power? In certain circumstances, that is exactly what this bill would seem to deliver. These questions need to be asked and they need to be answered. We can't just have a flat political statement that people don't like coal power stations. We need a legislative framework that will respond to the needs that we have. The wording and the drafting need to respond to the real questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard much about where this debate should be, and we heard Senator Macdonald wax lyrical about the strong reactions of the government. A strong admiration and respect and love of coal, which led to people bringing lumps of coal into this place, seem to still be the dominant features of the Turnbull government's approach to renewables and coal. Labor fought in 2014 and 2015 to block the government's then attempts to get rid of the renewable energy targets, which are the key element of what we have in our current system about renewable energies and our process. We have put our policies into the public domain. People know there's a strong commitment from Labor to renewable energy but there is not the same trust, the same acceptance and the same knowledge that the government has that same commitment to an effective renewable energy future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, Senator Di Natale talked about the issues around the Liddell plant in his contribution to the debate in the Senate. Two large coal-fired power stations have closed, with the federal government refusing to help workers and the communities deal with the impacts. This refusal goes directly against the obligation of the governments to deliver a just transition under the Paris accords. This was the opportunity for governments across the world to sign up to the Paris accords for a future that would see a transition from a coal-determined process to one that looked openly at renewables. A part of that has got to be bringing the workers and the communities along with the decisions so that there is what we talk about very openly, a just transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that industries across this country have been crippled by policy uncertainty and that the government have been key to delivering this uncertainty. You just know that no matter how many statements are made by this government about their commitment to renewables, there is this ongoing push within the government from certain individuals, who are very open in their views, that this will not happen, that somehow we in Australia have this special form of coal that is clean and that our clean coal doesn't need to be considered as the coal industry. In fact, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, the government has made very clear that they believe clean coal should actually be considered as renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within this space, this means that industries—the very people on whom we rely to work towards effective scientific change and to bring innovative practices as per the Sustainable Development Goals about innovation and production and the very people upon whom we rely to develop our industries—are confused and, in fact, crippled by this uncertainty from government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, and we've talked about it in this place before, the Finkel review. The government came to this place and suggested that they would have the Chief Scientist look at the whole issue of energy and our future. The Finkel review, on which $1.7 million was spent, then came up with recommendations and, after six months of these considerations, the government rejected much of what Finkel said. We had statements in this place calling for communities, scientists and people in this place to work together, to have a common aim and a common acceptance into the future, and the government said no. Instead of taking up the recommendations put out by Finkel, which had come through after many months of consultation all across the country—at Senate estimates we found out how many organisations and how many people with whom Professor Finkel spoke—we had the review and the recommendations, and then the government decided to take another road to the future. This was, obviously, one that was looking to a new future and that was looking very carefully at where we were going, and now we're concentrating on the National Energy Guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we've talked many times in this place about the National Energy Guarantee. It came out as a very, very small document; one that could be easily read because there wasn't much in it. Now, as time goes by, and after the last round of Senate estimates, a bit more detail is being built around the National Energy Guarantee. But we've been able to find out that the scheme has been estimated to cut utility-scale renewable energy investment by a massive 95 per cent compared to today's level. Today, a report has been released which says that the NEG will deliver no additional renewable energy investment at all. If that is the result and if that is the planned future by this government, how can we be confident that we will see any just transition—a just transition to renewable energy, a just transition for workers and a just transition to security in our country? It just doesn't add up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor continues to be committed to finding a cross-party framework to support the badly-needed investment to transition our energy sector and to deliver reliable and affordable energy. But we can't sign a blank cheque and we won't support a policy that strangles rather than supports transition to clean energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the government's NEG or, indeed, to today's Greens bill, the real devil is in the detail. Neither the government nor the Greens bill have given enough thought to this or enough detail for us to be certain that they have an effective future for our country in their sights. That's why Labor won't support this bill and why we can't commit to a barely-thought-out NEG. We are interested in serious answers to the country's serious problems, and we just can't rely on short media grabs that talk one way or the other about what the magic result is going to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bangkok, in February this year, there was an international meeting based on the Sustainable Development Goals, looking at goal No. 7, which is the one around affordable and clean energy. This was an attempt to put a benchmark on what is happening across the world now. People from all over the world, people from all levels of industry, people who really understood not only the way energy should operate but the impact of energy on communities, came together at this meeting in Bangkok. This was a prelude to a further meeting which is going to take place in New York later this year where we will look clearly at an understanding that energy is inextricably interlinked with the whole sustainable development goal agenda, which is focused on poverty eradication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sustainable development goal No. 7 was the first ever universal goal on energy. A high-level political forum on sustainable development later this year will be considering SDG7 along with a range of other goals that look at what is happening on energy in our community. That forum will be occurring in New York. I'm really hopeful that Australia will be present at that meeting with information about what we have achieved—not short answers but clearly thought-out policy about how our nation is going to be part of the international response around the need for clean, safe energy for everybody, not just in Australia but around the world. This conference will be important. When Australia does go to that particular conference, I am truly hoping that we will not be having confusion about what our progress will be and lingering doubts among people across this chamber about whether there will be a renewable energy future. I am hopeful that we will be part of a global response so that we will be able to have respectful debates in this place but bring our community along behind us so that a just transition to renewable energy will occur in this place and across the communities and we won't be leaving anyone behind.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill 2015, which my colleague the former senator Larissa Waters introduced into this place. I thank Senator Waters for her contribution to progress towards equality, and I'm pleased to debate this bill here today. We've brought this debate on today to ensure that this place retains a focus on real, concrete actions to reduce the gender pay gap in Australia. As long as the gender pay gap persists in Australia, we are failing to achieve our best as a nation. We are missing out on the best of our talent and our potential by failing to properly provide for equal pay for equal work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help to reduce the gender pay gap by banning gag clauses, which prevent workers in various sectors and industries from discussing their pay with their colleagues. This bill amends the Fair Work Act 2009 so that any contract of employment, enterprise agreement or award that prohibits workers from discussing their pay will have no effect. It would probably surprise a few people that many workers, especially those in the private sector who are receiving a salary, are not allowed to talk about their pay with their colleagues. Many employment contracts include a gag clause, which means that workers can be disciplined or even sacked for talking about their pay. Workers should have the option to voluntarily discuss their terms and conditions of employment with their colleagues. This bill seeks to enable that. It would not force anyone to discuss their pay, but it would make sure that employers could not pressure their employees to stay silent. This bill also prevents employers from taking action against employees for discussing their pay with their colleagues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not one who would usually spruik the banks, but there is an excellent bank advertisement that goes to the heart of the gender pay gap. You might have seen this ad. There are several children—siblings—who are asked to do chores. They do their chores and then the boys are paid more than the girls. All the children are shocked, none more so than the girls, and their reactions are not only heart warming but accurate. 'It should be flat-out illegal,' one of them says. I'm not joking. I'm not being unreasonable. If you do the same work, you should get paid the same money. I have no words. It's so wrong. How does the gender pay gap happen?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me share some stories with you. I've known so many friends and colleagues whose career pathways seem to have a default ending of lower pay than our male colleagues. I think of the women I went to school with and went to uni with, and the trajectory is very familiar. We finished our degrees and went into full-time work—bright, energetic, enthusiastic, the world being our oyster—in our early and mid-20s. But even then, immediately after graduation, our brash, confident male colleagues were more than likely to be offered and to be paid more than us, overselling their competencies as we were often more realistic about ours. My friend and former senator in this place Larissa Waters talked about her own experience of pay secrecy during her time working on these issues. She talked about her experience as a junior graduate lawyer, a couple of months into her exciting new role, and learning that the guy sitting next to her, also straight out of uni, was earning $5,000 more each year. They were doing exactly the same job, and were so early in their careers. That extra $5,000 was a hefty portion of her overall pay. The two had equal experience as junior lawyers and she'd even got better marks than him. He inadvertently let this pay discrepancy slip in a casual conversation, but otherwise it wouldn't have been transparent or known, because of the level of pay secrecy in that firm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many life circumstances that lead many women to end up with lower pay outcomes. For many of us, the time of our early careers coincides with relationships becoming serious, with moving in with our partner and with beginning a family, and our working lives then take a back seat to child rearing. Don't get me wrong. I loved having kids. But life at that time was a juggle of part-time work, paid child care, parents looking after the kids, school drop-offs and pick-ups, after-school care, feeling guilty about the kids going to after-school care too much and feeling guilty about before-school care and trying to avoid that as much as possible. I personally found three days a week to be the right balance between being there for my kids and contributing to paying the mortgage and keeping my professional life ticking over. But many other mothers I know chucked in their careers altogether, deciding to scrape by on significantly less household income in order to live a happier, less stressful family life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of one friend, who trained as an immunologist. She was out of the paid workforce for almost 10 years, home with the kids until her youngest went to school, and then retrained as a secondary school science teacher. Many of these women have found it difficult getting back into their preferred careers, having to then compete against younger, more recently graduated folk. And the life skills that they have gained in bringing up kids—juggling, multitasking, being very flexible and problem solving—aren't recognised. The people who would recognise their skills generally aren't doing the recruiting. Going back to study and starting again is a common course of action, and with it come more years out of the paid workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another woman I know, who is now in her mid-40s, has a PhD in climate science. Her three kids are now aged 10, eight and five. She's back at work part-time at their primary school, working as a teacher's aide, which is really, really important work but a role that fits a pattern of being undertaken largely by women and consequently being undervalued and underpaid. She's fortunate, with her higher degree, that she's got other options, and she's now looking for work that is more relevant to her qualifications and that will be better remunerated. But she's struggling to find something more suitable, mainly because she is not wanting to work full-time just yet. If she can't find anything she'll stick to being a teacher's aide, regardless of how poorly paid it is. It's rewarding work, it's close to home and it fits in around the kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other friends, even now that their kids are at high school, don't apply for promotions at work because of the expectations of lots of overtime, being inconsistent with a healthy work-life balance, and that's particularly so as our parents are ageing. Some of my contemporaries are now taking a month or more at a time of unpaid leave to help ageing parents move into retirement villages or nursing homes, and/or they're dropping back to four days a week so that they can be available to drive their parents off to doctors appointments and physio appointments, and it goes on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill that we are discussing today won't solve these structural problems. We are going to have to keep working on these. But at least it would mean that, when women were getting back into the paid workforce after having kids, or dropping back to part-time work, they would more likely be able to negotiate and be paid what they were worth—at least on par with that brash young male graduate who fits, to a T, the stereotypical expectations of those doing the recruiting, or that senior partner who, yes, works long hours and is always available. But does he really deliver that much more? Does he deserve to be paid that much more?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, the full-time gender pay gap in Australia is 15.3 per cent—15.3 per cent—and this has largely remained unchanged for 20 years. While the percentage is an important thing to note, it's crucial that we understand exactly what that means in tangible terms. The 15.3 per cent gender pay gap means that women working full time earn, per week, on average, $1,409, compared to $1,662.70 for men. That's $253.70 less. That's a difference of $13,192.40 less every year for the average female full-time worker; $131,924 over 10 years; and $527,696 over 40 years—over half a million dollars. These figures are staggering. And they are unacceptable. The private sector has a staggering 19.2 per cent gender pay gap, compared to 10.8 per cent in the public sector, and it is not unrelated that pay gap clauses largely don't exist in the public sector and are much, much more commonplace in the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses just one factor that contributes to the gender pay gap, but it is an important one. In their submission to the inquiry into this bill, the Workplace Gender Equality Agency reminded us of some of the other significant factors: that particular industries have different methods of setting pay and that this affects the pay gap; that industries and sectors which generally have individual agreements between employer and employee, rather than awards or collective agreements, tend to have a worse gender pay gap; and that Australian employment remains gender-segregated in many respects, with women and men traditionally working in different industries and different jobs, and there aren't many industries in Australia where gender parity has been achieved in workplace make-up. Added to this is that our society and economy largely undervalue work in female-dominated industries and jobs, whether in child care or aged care or hairdressing, and that these jobs tend to attract lower wages than jobs in male-dominated industries, resulting in significant differences in pay between men and women. The pay gap between genders is also reinforced by differences in access to education between women and men. Another contributing factor is that there is a lack of women in senior positions across the board, but especially in certain industries such as financial and insurance services, where women are paid 26.1 per cent less than male colleagues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are correlations, as I've already talked about, between the lack of pay equality and women overwhelmingly performing more unpaid caring responsibilities, and ending up with reduced remuneration upon return to the workforce as they potentially manage caring alongside work, or they experience role re-definition and pay changes after taking time out. And of course there are the additional effects of taking leave to fulfil caring responsibilities, such as reduced earnings and reduced superannuation contributions. Women experiencing more direct and indirect discrimination in the workplace can also be a major contributing factor to lack of promotion to senior positions. That's what happens when we see the old boys' clubs prevailing in certain workplaces and industries, and it can mean that promotions and development opportunities are disproportionately allocated to men. These are interrelated work, family, social and cultural factors, and we must keep them in front of mind as we consider the gender pay gap and the ways we can keep driving that gap down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens had this bill drafted in order to take a step towards pay equality, while acknowledging these many other factors that influence inequality in the workplace and in pay scales. Getting rid of gag clauses will contribute to much greater pay transparency in workplaces and mean that employers will have to justify how they pay their workers, rather than allowing discrimination and unconscious bias to creep into their decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when pay deals are not kept in the dark, and when workers know what their colleagues are earning, the gender pay gap is smaller, and this is demonstrated by the stark difference in the pay gap between the private and the public sectors. Shining the light on secret pay deals means that all workers, including women, are treated fairly and receive the same pay for the same job. When salaries are set through individual negotiations, and workers are prevented from discussing the outcome with each other, overall, women end up with less pay. While there's no evidence to suggest that women's abilities to negotiate are any different from men's, research shows that women's negotiations tend to be less successful than men's.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been in this space, working to reduce the gender pay gap, for a long time. This bill was first tabled in 2015, and I would strongly urge all parties and Independents in this chamber to support this bill. As we flagged in our dissenting report on the inquiry held into this bill, we would consider amendments to improve this bill even further, based on evidence that we heard from the submissions to the inquiry. But the fact remains: women should be paid the same as men for the same job. Everyone should be paid the same for the same job. It's as simple as that. This isn't controversial. I doubt you'd find anybody in this place who would disagree that people, regardless of gender, are entitled to equal pay for equal work. This isn't women wanting special treatment. It isn't about women wanting more than men. It's simply about being paid the same as a man for the same job. At the heart of it, it's about fairness. This is what this bill seeks to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill isn't the only thing that we need to do to reduce the gender pay gap to zero. There are other factors at play and other structural issues that must be addressed. But what the Greens are putting forward today is one concrete step towards addressing the issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing the gender pay gap is about fairness. Everyone should be paid the same for the same job, regardless of their gender. In the bank advertisement that I discussed earlier, one of the girls says to one of the boys, who has just been paid more than her, 'What we're trying to tell you is that it's not fair that boys get paid more than girls.' It's so simple that even children understand it. The question is: is it simple enough for this parliament to start taking some steps towards addressing the persistent gender pay gap in Australia?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I thank Senator Rice and the Greens for bringing to the floor of this chamber the debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill 2015. I was pleased to hear a lot of what Senator Rice said in her contribution there, acknowledging that I don't think there is anyone in this place that would believe trying to perpetuate the situation where we do have a gender pay gap is acceptable. Everyone wants to make sure that we have fairness in this sense. I think it is right that we acknowledge that that is the aim that everyone that comes to this debate would have. How we get there, Senator Rice, I suppose is probably going to be how we differ with regard to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important issue, and it's been one that has been talked about extensively for some time now—a very, very long period of time. We talk about it more as a society that more openly embraces equality between the sexes, something that up until a few years ago I don't think we did properly, and I still think we have a long way to go in that space, but it is the catalyst for this debate. And the statistics we've seen, many of which Senator Rice referred to in her contribution, do bear out the problem that we face, as a Western society, with regard to trying to level the playing field when it comes to take-home pay of women and where that sits with regard to the take-home pay of men. No-one in this place could suggest that it is right to continue to perpetuate this problem that we see with regard to the take-home pay of women, as opposed to men. We all want to fix it. It's how we get there that we need to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, in looking at the bill that former Senator Waters did prepare, we have to consider: is this the best way? And I do acknowledge, as Senator Rice pointed out on a couple of occasions, that this is but one element of how the Greens would see the parliament, and indeed the government, address this issue. But my question is: well, should we be doing these standalone things, ticking these items one by one off a list of things that need to be done to address a complex situation? Personally, having had a look at the work of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, I'm not sure that way—removing, as has been referred to by Senator Rice, the gag clauses as a standalone item—is the way to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Rice said, the bill seeks to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 by removing restrictions on employees' rights to disclose the amount they earn or other information about their pay or earnings as well as prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees for disclosing this information. I haven't been able to go and research what action, if any, has been taken—I assume Senator Rice is aware of action that may have been taken in relation to employees who have breached these provisions of the Fair Work Act—but it is about what a change of this nature, what changing the Fair Work Act in accordance with these amendments, would actually do in practice to address this issue that needs changing. We are all in furious agreement that it needs changing, but how far would it take us to do that? What consequences would flow from this? What unforeseen consequences would flow from this? We need to consider all of those questions, which is the right thing for this chamber to do, as we do consider this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to consider the context here in Australia—I wouldn't quite call it historical, but I mean where things are at now and where they have been over the past few years with regard to the gender pay gap. Indeed, it is important to note, and Senator Rice did point this out, that the latest figure from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the gender pay gap highlights that it is at 15.3 per cent. Now that is still not good enough—no-one is saying it is—but it is down from a high of 18.5 per cent, which is where it was in November 2014. That's a drop of more than three per cent. We do need to acknowledge that, but, at the same time, we need to accept that this means there is a huge amount of work yet to be done. We've got another 15.3 per cent to work through in order to ensure that this issue has been dealt with. This statistic means that it's the lowest it's been for 12 years. It's also pleasing to see that women's employment in this country is at a record high of over 5.8 million. The women's workforce participation rate has risen since 2016. It reached 60.5 per cent as at December last year according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics' figures that they released in January this year. It does highlight that there are some efforts being made by government, by employee representative organisations and also, hopefully, the private sector, noting the difference in the statistics relating to the private and public sectors. So there is work happening, things are changing and things are improving, but we've got a long way to go. It is important, though, to acknowledge those things that have happened to date as a result of work that the government has been doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Rice points out, though, it is a complex issue and not one influenced by a single factor. There is no way the government could intervene in any meaningful way without causing all sorts of problems across the employment markets, because it is incredibly complex. The issue is related to the numbers of hours worked in certain professions. Full-time men work on average more hours per week, 42.1, than full-time women, 38.2. I think it goes to that point Senator Rice raised around the individual circumstances of the woman versus the man. Another factor is the greater unpaid caring responsibilities of women. These sorts of things flow into the capacity of an individual to work, and then onto the statistics we are seeing with regard to the gender pay gap—all things we need to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The industrial and occupational segregation has been talked about as well. Six in 10 Australians work in an industry dominated by one gender. An example is child care, where we have seen over many years a desire from those who work within that sector to achieve a better pay rate. My wife is involved in the childcare industry. The employees at that centre are all women. There was one male there for a short period of time. It highlights the issue of occupational and industrial segregation Senator Rice referred to, which also flows into this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The differences in education, work experience and seniority and the differing levels of qualifications and expertise people bring may be dominated to a degree by gender. I've spoken previously about my mother and my grandmother, two women who, as a result of their life experiences, were impeded from climbing the ladder in their workforces. My mother, who didn't satisfactorily complete year 10, went off to be a checkout clerk in one of the local department stores, and effectively that was it for her education and employment for a very long period of time. Fast-forward 40 years, and she has now completed her PhD at the University of Tasmania, but she has often said to me that her lack of educational experience—where her brothers were given the opportunity to attain a university education, in addition to having completed years 11 and 12 at the local college in Tasmania at the time, but she was not—had an impact on how she lived her life. Thankfully we don't see much of those sorts of things anymore. Where they occur, we need to ensure they are stamped out and that opportunities are provided, particularly in regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is worth talking about a number of the actions being taken by the government with regard to this issue. Despite the figures I cited earlier—that there are now over 5.8 million Australian women in employment, that the participation rate is the highest on record at 60.5 per cent, and that the pay gap has dropped to 15.3 per cent—there is still work to be done. It was pleasing to note that my colleague Senator Cash has released <span style="font-style:italic;">Towards 2025: an Australian government strategy to boost women's workforce participation</span>, the document which guides the government's efforts in dealing with this issue, along with any of the other flow-on issues related to gender discrimination. Elements of the plan, which is to be rolled out over the next 10 years, include ensuring that there are flexible arrangements for affordable and accessible childcare, so that families can make a choice and we can overcome the somewhat natural barriers to women entering the workforce that have been described in the debate so far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On improving workplace diversity and flexibility, we're seeing the government make a point about ensuring that flexible work is a normal part of the workplace for both men and women; supporting both men and women to innovate and to succeed with entrepreneurial efforts, and to thrive in whatever field they choose to go into; working to strengthen women's economic security to ensure that women are secure, independent and empowered through our society and through attaining work; and ensuring that there is a set of enhanced financial incentives to work. So it's clear that there are a number of measures in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This strategy, though, also identifies six groups of women who have specific needs and whose experiences need to be specifically catered for. Those groups include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, culturally and linguistically diverse women, mature-aged women, rural and regional women—one group I've already spoken about here—women with a disability, and, of course, young women. Sometimes people will fall into a number of those categories as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are implementation plans being rolled out each year with regard to this strategy, to ensure that we are going to see the results needed to get things right with regard to issues like the gender pay gap. The 2017-18 implementation plan outlined a number of actions, including the expansion of ParentsNext to assist 68,000 parents with young children to plan and prepare for employment, at a value of $263 million; the implementation of the new Launch into Work program to assist jobseekers to become job ready; the promotion of the benefits of flexible work for small and medium businesses, which is another issue, because smaller enterprises which don't have the resources or the capacity to absorb the notion of a flexible workplace are something that the government does need to support, and it is pleasing to see the government do that; and a gender analysis of employment services to both improve current service delivery and inform employment services by 2020.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to briefly talk on some of the measures that the Tasmanian government's been taking with regard to dealing with issues of gender discrimination. The most pleasing thing I've read for a little while is that in the Tasmanian parliament—the lower house, at least—a majority of members are women. Thirteen out of the 25—yes, it's a small parliament!—are women. It is the first time in Tasmania's history, I believe, that that has happened—and Senator McKim breathes a sigh of relief over there!—with regard to the outcome in Tasmania. That is a good thing, and I think it does show what that state is doing to try and address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hodgman Liberal government in Tasmania is committed to dealing with this issue. It does have its own five-year Tasmanian Women's Plan, which has been running since 2013 and concludes this year—and I'm sure there will be more to come on that front—and which has set out a framework for creating gender equality by reducing systemic barriers to women's participation and leadership opportunities. There are a great number of achievements in there as a result of the last four and a bit years of work—indeed, the previous government was as committed to dealing with this issue in Tasmania as the current one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statistics which do bear out that there are some great initiatives the government can employ include those from the Women on Boards strategy, which helps females in Tasmania secure positions on many of the government boards that exist relating to government business enterprises, state-owned companies and other committees within the structure of government. The overall percentage of female representation on these boards has increased from just over 30 per cent to just over 40 per cent as at October last year, which is a great sign that we are embracing the need for diversity and we are ensuring that it begins to exist in leadership roles and leadership entities in our state. As at 24 October 2017, 53 per cent of government business enterprises had board members that were women, and 44 per cent of the state-owned company board members were women. So we're well on the way there with one of them, and exceeding in another area. There are a number of boards that the government is responsible for—131 in total—and it is great to see most of those well on the way to ensuring that those targets are being reached.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the government's plan, it is nice to refer to the comments of Susan Fahey, the CEO of the Tasmanian Women's Legal Service, who said, 'This plan is a truly whole-of-government approach. It's a significant plan that shows the government can walk and chew gum, and it provides a solid foundation for significantly reducing family violence in our community.' That was in relation to the family violence component of the government's plans. Teeny Brumby, an alderman from Burnie City Council, gave feedback on the Australian Institute of Company Directors scholarships course funded by the Tasmanian government. In her comments, she said, 'This learning experience, as a woman in leadership in Tasmania, cannot be underestimated. It is absolutely brilliant to see our government investing in the future of female leaders in our state, and I cannot thank the AICD and the Tasmanian government enough for their generous support in this remarkable journey.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of good things happening in Tasmania and across the country with regard to dealing with this issue, but, that said, there is more to be done. I go back to the question I asked at the very beginning of my contribution: what does this particular piece of legislation do to address the issue fundamentally? I note that in the United Kingdom the government has imposed a mandatory reporting regime with regard to gender pay matters. The implementation of that has been met with mixed reviews. I understand that private entities that employ over 250 people—of which there are 9,000 that are required to report—are supposed to lodge information about how much they pay the women and the men in their organisation so that we have transparency around it. The statistics in the UK show that gender pay remains an issue and that this standalone measure won't go to fix that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alarmingly, the response from the entities who have been required to provide this information suggests that the process is flawed. There are reports of at least 20 companies in the UK providing bunkum details to throw the system, so that no-one would find out what the true gender pay gap was within their organisation. There's clearly no mechanism to ensure that what they have provided is accurate, and so when 20 companies, some of them extremely large in the employment number they have, do this one has to question whether this system could actually generate any good outcomes. If we're reliant on the honour and goodwill of an entity participating in this process and on them providing accurate information, that leaves some significant holes. Indeed, research conducted on companies participating in this process indicated that they believe the system wouldn't work. Some openly admitted they would game the system, that they would provide information that wouldn't accurately reflect the nature of things within their organisation. That is concerning. It suggests that it will not go to solving the problem of the gender pay gap we have. When the system doesn't have the strength of enforcement around it, how do you ensure that that information is accurate? It really is about working across the issues—the complex issues, the range of issues; as the government is doing and other governments before it have, too—and trying to get to the root cause of all of these problems to ensure that we properly address them, that we look not just at one area and deal with that, which could yield unintended consequences, but at the whole gamut and make sure we do it comprehensively and properly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  The gender pay gap is a multifaceted problem. It arises from a complex mix of cultural and economic factors, which range from gender segregation in the workplace through the availability of flexible working conditions to outright discrimination. Closing the gender pay gap will require a coordinated effort across our social, taxation and workplace relations policies. Eliminating it may take a generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this, it is entirely predictable that the Greens would draft a bill that contains only two substantive sections and gives us the grandiosely ambitious name Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill—the bill does not deserve this title. Labor is inclined to support it—we believe that pay secrecy is an obstacle to pay equity—but we have substantive concerns about the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill only addresses one small aspect of the gender pay gap and its significant drafting flaws mean that it doesn't even address that aspect effectively. Labor has been considering this idea for some time and we believe a strengthened version, with the drafting problems removed, may have some merit as part of a suite of other measures. But this is the point: the Greens don't have a coherent, well-developed set of measures to properly address the gender pay gap, and yet that is what this bill purports to do. This bill is what happens when you draft policies on the basis of what they'll look like on a Facebook post rather than how they'll impact on the people who depend on you. We on the Labor side know that as a sole measure it simply does not go far enough in dealing with the disparities in wages between working men and working women in Australia today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has flaws which ought to have been addressed: there's been plenty of time, and the fact that they haven't been reveals the Greens' lack of real commitment to this issue. One wonders what they have been doing since the Senate committee reported. This bill has remained unchanged since it was first introduced in September 2015, during the 44th Parliament. Following its introduction in 2015 this bill was referred to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which handed down its report in 2016, during the last parliament. The committee heard from a number of submitters—impressive evidence, actually—including many legal experts who identified obvious and also some unintentional flaws with the way the bill was drafted. The Labor senators' dissenting report pointed out that these concerns should be addressed. The Greens' report indicated that these concerns should be addressed but, disappointingly, they remain in the bill as we re-examine it today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say it's disappointing, but it is also predictable that the Greens have not addressed any of the concerns raised by submitters or by the opposition through amendments before asking the Senate to consider it once again. I acknowledge that Senator Rice said she was willing to consider amendments, but that is not good enough. Actual reform by a party that aspires to form government requires actually doing the work, not just relying on a more serious operation to deliver that for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go through some of the problems. We note that the bill does not prevent pay secrecy practices; it merely prevents the operation of pay secrecy clauses in contracts or awards. Accordingly, it offers no protection for workers who are directed to keep their pay confidential by their employer or any workers whose company policies or procedures require them to keep their pay confidential. This means that should this legislation pass unamended, workers might end up incorrectly assuming they are free to disclose their pay without consequence when in fact they could face significant consequences for doing so. The Law Council, in its submission to the inquiry into the bill, also considered that the bill did not create a workplace right and that therefore it does not offer protection under the Fair Work Act 2009 if the employer were to take adverse action against an employee for revealing their pay. Again, as drafted, this bill won't fully protect workers who disclose their pay. Professor Andrew Stewart, a specialist lawyer in workplace relations and academic at the University of Adelaide, also observed a clear limitation of the bill in relation to coverage. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it seems to me that the bill has a number of potential flaws in some respects—seeking to go too far and in other respects not going far enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say that the flaws in the drafting of the bill meant:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It does not, as the explanatory memorandum claims, in my view, 'make sure that workers are allowed to tell their colleagues what they are paid if they wish to without fear of retaliation'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her submission to the committee, Professor Marian Baird, a gender employment relations specialist, and her colleague, Ms Alexandra Heron, suggested that the bill be amended to ban pay secrecy clauses to make the intention clear. Further, they recommended that the bill should be amended to ensure that the Fair Work Information Statement informs employees about pay transparency at the beginning of their engagement in a job. The ACTU also made this suggestion during their appearance before the committee, stressing the importance of making workers aware of their rights to disclose information about pay. Despite all this, the Greens have made no attempt to amend this bill as a result of the Senate inquiry which reported in November 2016, nor have they made any attempt to discuss this bill with the opposition to discuss how we might set about remedying these deficiencies. This is not how you behave if you are serious about addressing an issue, but the scope of the bill alone shows us that the Greens are more concerned about being seen to be acting than they are about actually making a difference. Addressing pay secrecy is important, but without any other policies it will barely make a dent in the pay gap. In this, as in so many other policy areas, the Greens have shown themselves to be disinterested in doing the detailed and unheralded work that accompanies all meaningful reform. It's not, of course, the only example, and it's not the only example as it relates to women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk for a moment about the annual wage review that is currently being undertaken by the Fair Work Commission. For the second year in a row, the government's submission to the review has claimed that lifting the minimum wage would not have any impact on the gender pay gap, because they claim that most of the gender pay gap exists between high-income earners. This is wrong—this is not the advice provided by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency—and I want to talk through why it's wrong. The pay gap is not just about a man and a woman sitting side by side doing the same job for different pay, although that happens. Research shows that much of the pay gap actually arises from structural discrimination that operates across whole industries and occupations. That's more subtle than straight-out discrimination against individual women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian workplaces are highly gender segregated. Men and women tend to be clustered in different jobs in different sectors. The problem is that the more women there are in a type of occupation or sector, the more likely it is that that sector is poorly paid when compared to male-dominated occupations or sectors. What it means in practice is that workers with very similar experience and workers with very similar levels of education are paid different amounts depending on whether they work in a male- or a female-dominated field. We're talking about a certificate III being worth more if you work as a mechanic than it is if you work in child care. We're talking about the maintenance department staff being paid more than the cafeteria staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side would probably say that these different kinds of labour are just valued differently in the market. It might be that some colleagues on the crossbench and some colleagues in the Greens seats would say the same thing. They'd say that this is just a case of the market at work, but this is actually a case of the market not working. As a society, we have consistently undervalued women's work. Pay is particularly bad in roles that mirror the work that women have traditionally done at home, such as care work. We are pretty terrible at recognising the value of that work when it is done by family members. We have not been much better at recognising it when it's being done by female professionals. It's not an answer to just say, 'Oh well, men and women choose different career paths.' There's a complex set of factors that push both men and women into gender-typical careers. Individual choice is not a remedy to this, and many women have no choice. Some female-dominated fields are female dominant because they are the only place that offers truly flexible roles where women can combine their caring obligations with professional work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the long run it may not even matter what field women choose. Research shows that pay drops once women begin to take over a male-dominated field. A landmark US study examined over half a century of data, and they found that wages fell for everyone, from ticket sellers to designers, as their field became more feminised. If women changing careers isn't the answer, what is?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review comes in. In Labor's submission to the 2018 Fair Work Commission annual wage review, we reinforced that a significant contributing factor to the size of the gender pay gap is the fact that women are more likely to be employed in low-paid industries and jobs and that they're more likely than their male counterparts to be reliant on award wages. We called on the commission to give weight to equal remuneration and closing the gender pay gap in the annual wage review. What did the Greens' submission say? Nothing. They didn't bother to make one. Now, I don't know whether that's because the Greens don't have the capacity for detailed, low-profile policy work or whether it is because they simply don't think it's important. But it is important. It's very important, and the commissioner's decision will make a difference to millions of Australian workers and many, many women. Policy change requires more than a self-congratulatory social media post.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor is committed to a suite of reforms to address the gender pay gap, and we have a track record of making meaningful change from the government benches. Employers now measure and report their progress on gender equality over time under Labor's Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 and the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. We delivered national paid parental leave so that families don't have to make the difficult choice between time with a new baby and covering all the bills. Labor delivered affordable, flexible and high-quality child care so that working parents have a real choice and better care for their children. And we locked in more protection for women and men against discrimination and sexual harassment through amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come back to government we'll return with a bold agenda. We know that we need a strong and comprehensive plan for gender equality to address the persistent and shameful gender pay gap in Australia today. On 7 March this year we launched a national strategy for gender equality and highlighted our commitment to make gender equality a central priority for a future Labor government. Only our comprehensive strategy, not a piecemeal strategy, will achieve gender equality in our workplaces. So far we have committed to tangible reforms and targets to achieve this in both the public and the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll take you through some of it. It's a very long list. We will take measurable action to close the gender pay gap and we will report annually to parliament on our progress. We will reduce the gap in women's workforce participation by 25 per cent by 2025. We will raise representation of women on government boards to 50 per cent within the first term of government. We will boost the representation of women in chair and deputy chair positions on government boards to 40 per cent by 2025. We will set a stretch target of 50 per cent representation of women in senior Public Service roles by 2025. To ensure that women's voices are heard by government, we will boost funding to the six national women's alliances, which represent over 180 women's organisations. They'll take the lead in bringing forward the views, voices and issues of Australian women, in particular women from marginalised and disadvantaged groups. We'll provide $15.2 million to the Australian Bureau of Statistics to conduct the time use survey in 2020 and again in 2027. And then we'll have the evidence base to help us better understand how government policies impact women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will take action to protect university students from sexual harassment and sexual assault. We'll set up frameworks for gender-responsive policy and decision-making, including introducing gender impact statements on cabinet submissions and new policy proposals. We'll bring back the women's budget statement and we will convene a ministerial council of gender equality. We'll restore the penalty rates, cuts to which have disproportionately impacted women on low incomes. We will put 10 days of paid domestic violence leave into the National Employment Standards. We will make sure that procurement rules are implemented effectively to ensure that all companies that are awarded government contracts meet the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's requirements. We will work with the Australian Public Service Commission and the CPSU to promote more flexible working arrangements for both men and women in the Australian Public Service. And we are committed to an industrial relations system that can address the gendered undervaluation of work and to improve the wages of low-paid women. This is what a commitment to economic justice for women actually looks like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have been asleep at the wheel on this issue. They have been hopeless. But we expect that from them. They have very little interest in gender equality. Take a look at the composition of the coalition party room. Take a look at the composition of the coalition front bench. This government cannot point to a single thing that they have done to improve pay for low-income women. They cannot point to a single thing they have done to reduce the gender pay gap or to make society more equal or more fair, because they do not believe in it. We expect this from a conservative government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is disappointing that the Greens aren't prepared to do more either. It is not enough to be progressive on Twitter. You do not solve the gender pay gap by just putting the phrase in the title of the bill. Change takes commitment, and it takes hard, and often low-profile, work. And I would like to invite the Greens to join us in displaying either.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on the Greens' Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill 2015. I'll start off by saying that there is absolutely no doubt that entrenched gender pay gaps exists globally, and that includes right here in Australia. But, like all complex problems, we need to adopt a comprehensive and evidence based approach to resolve it, instead of letting what I'd call simplistic populism guide us here in this chamber..</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap is something that I'm very passionate about, and I know it's a passion shared by many across all sides of this chamber. But it does require a comprehensive suite of long-term and genuine policy changes to really address it. This amendment, as proposed by the Greens, would enact changes that will not work. The amendment was not even recommended by the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which tabled its report into this amendment in November 2016. The very reason the committee did not recommend this amendment is that there is simply no credible evidence that the mandatory removal of pay secrecy clauses will, by itself, reduce the gender pay gap. Instead, the committee itself recommended that government, employer and industry stakeholders and employee advocates collaborate to actively promote and implement best-practice strategies to tackle the gender pay gap in Australia's workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the government does understand that the gender pay gap is a complex issue. It is influenced by a number of highly interrelated factors. There are many causes for the gender pay gap. So there can never, ever, be one effective solution—or a silver bullet, as those in the Greens purport there to be in this case. That's why this government has adopted a multifaceted approach to addressing equal pay. And I think it's starting to work. It's showing progress, because the gap is narrowing. Since 2014, the gender pay gap for average weekly earnings of full-time adult employees has reduced from 18.5 per cent to 15.3 per cent in November of last year. It fell one per cent in the last 12 months alone. That is still a sizeable gap, but progress nonetheless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There would be no-one happier than me to see that gap narrow further, which is why I'm delighted that, on 6 July last year, the government released <span style="font-style:italic;">Towards 2025: an Australian government </span><span style="font-style:italic;">strategy to boost women'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s workforce participation</span>. Unlike this amendment before the Senate today, that strategy acknowledges that the gender pay gap is about so much more than employees knowing each other's salaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The predominant issue is not about a man and a woman doing the same job and getting different pay. That does still exist, but I know there's been a lot of work done by the private sector, by companies, to look for the reasons for it and to close that gap. Also, the Fair Work Act in fact already includes equal remuneration provisions, which enable people to make an application to the Fair Work Commission for an order to ensure equal remuneration for work that is equal or at least comparable. And, as I said, there are many companies now, across many professions, who are actively seeking and taking measures to close this gap within their own firms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this issue is more about women not being able to enter or re-enter the workforce at the same rate and at the same levels as men, often meaning that they have to take lower-paid jobs with less opportunity to access higher-salaried, full-time positions, they receive far fewer promotions than their male counterparts, and they also earn less of a bonus or a salary increase when they do move up the workplace ladder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap is an issue that must be grounded in discussions about education and employment opportunities, adequate parental leave, affordable and easily accessible child care and far more flexible work arrangements not just for women but also for men. It's also about what subjects girls and women choose to study, what jobs they take and how they are treated in the workplace itself. But it's also about men's and women's domestic lives. Can women take time off to raise their families without jeopardising their careers? I do not see this as just a women's issue; it is equally a men's issue. Most children today have two working parents. But in most workplaces the burden still falls on women to take the majority of time off and also to take leave and oversee all child-rearing activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reasons for that are quite complex, but I think it starts here in Australia, where we've been so incredibly successful in providing our young girls with equal opportunity in life. They have the same health outcomes as young boys and the same infant survival rates. We educate them well. We bring them up to be so full of confidence in themselves and their place in this world. In fact, we've done so well that girls mostly outperform boys in high school and also in university. In fact, more women graduate university than men. So our society has been incredibly successful in bridging that gap between young boys and young girls and young men and young women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that success seems to come to a screeching halt in many workplaces today. That is because we haven't made the changes. That is not only in terms of policy and regulation at the state and federal government level; it's also culturally and structurally within the organisations themselves. They haven't adapted fast enough to ensuring that both men and women, who both have children, have the same opportunities and the same responsibilities to look after their children. As I said, children mostly have two working parents. So it comes back to the point that this is not just a women's issue; it is equally a men's issue—or a two parents issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government understands the complexities of this issue and takes them seriously. The strategy I outlined earlier details the measures we're taking—what is already working—and looks at additional measures that drive pay inequality. So what are some of the factors driving what the government is doing, and what more could we all do to address this issue? The first problem that we need to address is the fact that women are less likely than men to enter into, and progress in, higher paying careers and seniority. This is a problem that the government is very clearly tackling. A great example of the positive action the government is taking—and it is something I'm very passionate about—is women in STEM. And I would now like us to be to talking about 'STEAM', because enhancing the artistic, creative and innovative side of boys' and girls' characters and abilities is as important as STEM. But the fact is that women are less likely to enter high-paying careers—and many today have their foundations in STEM. In fact, 75 per cent of Australia's fastest growing careers and jobs today demand digital literacy and STEM subjects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, alarmingly, the number of girls studying STEM subjects is declining. Women are significantly underrepresented in fields like information technology and engineering—some of the highest paying jobs of the future. Today, less than 15 per cent of senior STEM research positions in universities are held by women, and women make up only about one-quarter of STEM workforces across all sectors. If we're truly going to bridge the gender pay gap once and for all, we have to redouble our efforts in getting women into STEM positions—or STEAM positions—across all sectors. The Greens proposal to allow workers to share information about what each other gets paid in these circumstances will do absolutely nothing to change the statistics. It won't ensure that more women study STEM and enter the high-paying jobs in this profession. It will not make a difference at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, unlike those in the Greens with this very simplistic, populist proposal, believes in a bottom-up approach led by the choices individuals make for themselves and their children in what they study, and by businesses taking more action to create change within their organisations for the better. This is why the government, through the National Innovation and Science Agenda, NISA, is supporting measures to encourage more women to embark on and remain in STEM related careers—importantly, including entrepreneurship. We're implementing strong measures to ensure women have the skills and support they need to work in growth industries, through the investment of $13 million over five years in jobs for these growth sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is providing $2 million to set up the Male Champions of Change in STEM program. Male Champions of Change challenge men in leadership positions to step up beside women to drive cultural change on gender equality issues in major Australian organisations and industry sectors. While we've seen a great take-up of this program—particularly in larger private enterprise companies, who are making a real difference now in how they deal with both men and women and the opportunities for parental leave and for flexibility—which is incredibly encouraging, unfortunately we're not yet seeing much movement in a lot of the traditional STEM related industries and the IT sector. The adoption of the Male Champions of Change program is critically important in these sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also investing $8 million over four years towards projects that boost the participation of girls and women in STEM education careers, as I said, including as entrepreneurs. This first measure that I've gone through is all about long-term change to equality of opportunity, not the short-term populist fix proposed by those opposite. That's the first major barrier to the gender pay gap—engagement in the workforce and particularly in STEM—but the second issue that equally impacts upon the gender pay gap is a weak economy, which means fewer jobs. Demonstrably, in a weak economy women are disproportionately in lower paid jobs with less job security, superannuation and retirement certainty. To address this particular problem, the government is increasing women's access and readiness for employment not just in STEM but more broadly across all careers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean for women? Our policies since coming to government have strengthened Australia's economy—so much so that nearly 970,000 Australian jobs have been created after four years. Nearly a million new jobs have been created, something those on the opposite benches rarely—in fact, never—give this government credit for. Let's have a look at those figures a bit further. Nearly 60 per cent of the new jobs created over the last four years have gone to women. Boosting women's workforce participation is an economic priority for this government. We have to create more new jobs in this economy, which we're doing, but we also have to make sure they're in industries and areas in which women can and will take up jobs. It's not just the right thing to do for our society; it's also the economically smart thing to do, because it has the potential to add over $25 billion to the Australian economy while at the same time strengthening women's economic security. That was the second issue and one of the barriers to closing the pay gap for women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third issue I raise in this chamber today is the fact that women are still predominantly the primary caregivers for their children, which impacts upon their careers, salaries, superannuation and retirement security. As I said, we have done a wonderful job raising our girls and our boys—smart, confident and highly educated—but we have not yet satisfactorily addressed the situation that many women find in the workplace today. We certainly haven't addressed the cultural barriers to men who have young children in the same way we have with their wives. We have to change the processes in companies, in organisations and in the public sector to make it equally acceptable, and in fact encouraged, that both a child's parents will equally take parental leave, and not just put the requirement on women, because we know—as it has been very well reported—of the impact that has on women and that it is a significant contributing factor to the gender pay gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To address this particular aspect, the government is addressing factors that take women out of work and keep them out longer than their male counterparts. This decreases their path to promotion and over the longer term it ultimately lowers their pay and superannuation contributions, which means that more women retire with less in their superannuation fund—on average, $100,000—and are much more likely to be subject to poverty in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap also often occurs because of a discrepancy, partially caused through this, in the promotion pipeline. If fewer women work in an industry, there will be fewer women to promote. But women are then caught in a double bind, because under many traditional promotion based systems in many organisations they are starting from behind if they have also taken time out of their careers to rear their children. Each absence from the workplace lowers their opportunity for promotion and therefore their ability to increase their salaries and their savings, particularly superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of this particular problem is an issue for organisations, public and private, to resolve in their own workplaces. It is an issue for leaders in companies to set the standards and to change policies and practices in their organisations. It is critically important, and I argue that it is great business sense, for a company to create a family-positive environment for both their men and their women so that both parents can take parental leave—that both parents feel it's okay if they need to take time off for sick children or for school holidays—and the assumption and the responsibility doesn't just default to the woman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that affordable and accessible child care is critical to supporting parents who are balancing work and family commitments. That's why we're making child care more affordable. This government has already made the most significant reforms to the system in over 40 years. The new childcare package is unashamedly targeted at supporting parents who access child care so that they can work more, or train, or study, or volunteer in their communities. These reforms in themselves are expected to encourage more than 230,000 families to increase their workforce participation, the majority being women. From July 2018, the government is removing the $7,600 annual rebate cap for families on incomes up to $185,000—that's 85 per cent of the families using child care. That is a good measure and it is something practical and tangible that can make a difference. Families earning more than $185,000 will benefit from an increased cap of $10,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next barrier, the fourth barrier, that must be tackled is something I have already touched on. It is the unconscious bias that still exists in most organisations. Whether they be public organisations or private organisations, unconscious bias still exists and it contributes to gender pay gaps in those organisations. But it's great to see that the government is leading by example by implementing the Australian Public Service Gender Equality Strategy. This requires that every government agency set targets for gender equality in leadership positions and boost gender equality more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Cheap shot! We're also setting a target for men and women to each hold 50 per cent of government board positions overall, and we are strengthening the BoardLinks program. But there's still much more to the gender pay gap than all of that, and so much more that we have to do together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all of this change can be led and implemented solely by a single level of government. So much of what causes the gap is cultural and requires a cultural shift, and that's something that only people in individual organisations can do. Federal government can set the path, it can set the example, but it cannot change the culture within organisations, whether they be private or public, large or small. We can lead the way, but we cannot change it on our own. I believe we should close the gender pay gap—in fact, it is a moral imperative for us all—but we need to do things to tackle the four main problems, the four main barriers that I've discussed here today. Sadly, the proposal by the Greens will impact on none of those problems. We can work on it together, and we should work on it together to make more change.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  Labor agrees with what the Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill 2015 seeks to achieve. We agree that pay secrecy is an obstacle to pay equity, and that putting an end to gag clauses that prevent employees telling each other what they earn is a step in the right direction. The gender pay gap is worst where pay is kept secret. All too often women find out they're being paid less than their male colleagues after years of doing the same work as those colleagues. But we have some serious concerns about the drafting of this bill and whether or not this bill, as it stands, will actually lead to a reduction in the gender pay gap. We're inclined to support the bill, but these are flaws and holes that need to be addressed and acknowledged. These are flaws that the Greens have known about for a long time, but have failed to address. Frankly, the Greens don't have a genuine set of measures to address the gender pay gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill may benefit a part of the female workforce, in itself it is only a very small measure. As a sole measure, it simply doesn't go far enough to systematically shave down the known disparities in wages between working men and working women currently occurring in Australia today. This bill will also do little to address the pay of women who are not on enterprise agreements. The gender pay gap is a multifaceted problem that requires multifaceted strategies, not more grandstanding by the Greens.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has flaws that should be addressed. The fact that these flaws haven't been fixed highlights the Greens' lack of real commitment to the issue. This bill has remained unchanged since it was first introduced in September 2015. It was referred to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which handed down its report to the current parliament in 2016—two years ago, so there has been plenty of time, ample time, for the Greens to see the flaws in this bill and to address the deficiencies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard from a number of submitters, including legal experts, who identified obvious and unintentional flaws with the way in which this bill was drafted. Professor Andrew Stewart, a specialist in law and workplace relations from the University of Adelaide, also observed a clear limitation of the bill in relation to coverage. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's dissenting report pointed out these concerns. We sought to have them addressed. Disappointingly, the Greens didn't listen and these issues remain in the bill as it stands today. The Greens on their high horse, as they normally are, have neglected to take on board any of the concerns raised by submitters or Labor senators. They made no effort to fix their flawed bill or put forward amendments before asking the Senate to consider it here today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has also been no attempt to discuss the bill with us, the Labor opposition, in order to make improvements. This confirms yet again that the Greens really have no sincerity about this issue. This is just more point scoring and grandstanding on another issue, which we are all accustomed to from the Greens. If the Greens were very serious, if they were serious at all about closing this gap, they would have put in a submission to the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review. So they do the grandstanding to get the media, but all they're about is trying to score cheap political points without actually taking the issue to the conclusion that is needed—that is, by making a submission to Fair Work Australia.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive) Bill 2017 introduces the junior minerals exploration incentive, a slightly modified reincarnation of the three-year exploration development incentive that was introduced in 2014 and lapsed with the 2016-17 tax year. The junior minerals exploration incentive, as with the exploration development incentive, enables eligible companies to generate tax credits by giving up a portion of their tax losses from greenfield mineral exploration expenditure, which can then be distributed to shareholders. It's only available to junior exploration companies with no assessable income in a tax year, and it excludes companies that have commenced resources production and companies connected or affiliated with an entity that has commenced resources production. Entities must be disclosing entities under the Corporations Act. Treasury says there are approximately 700 small firms that are eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme, as indicated in the material provided by the government, is capped at $100 million over its four-year duration. The aims of the scheme are to encourage exploration of greenfield areas, a task usually undertaken by junior minerals exploration companies. The member for Blaxland, in his speech in the second reading debate, noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over the five years to 2015-16, expenditure on greenfield exploration around Australia dropped by 70 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This trend is concerning to the Labor Party, because we know success in mining ventures creates jobs, and good jobs for Australians will always be a concern for the Labor Party. We understand that smaller companies are riskier—that's in part because of the delays from exploration to discovery—and they can find it difficult to attract capital to undertake greenfields mineral exploration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax law allows immediate deduction of the full value of any depreciating asset, broadly an asset with a limited useful life, where it is first used for exploration or prospecting for minerals and also when the taxpayer carries on mining operations—or proposes to carry on such an operation—or incurs the expenditure in the course of the business of exploration or prospecting for minerals. However, smaller companies engaged solely in exploration for minerals may earn less assessable income in a given income year than they outlay on the exploration or prospecting. Such companies, therefore, will generally have a tax loss for that income year. This tax loss will not provide any benefit unless the company earns sufficient assessable income in a future income year against which the loss can be deducted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Uptake of the previous exploration development incentive was less than the capital outflow. Industry argues that this was due to a complex modulation of claims, which is a way of sharing the credits fairly. The new scheme's first come, first served approach, with a five per cent maximum entitlement per entity, is designed to simplify the fair distribution of claims. Minerals exploration companies must apply to the Commissioner of Taxation and provide appropriate information to be eligible to issue the tax credits. The commissioner will determine whether the entity was a greenfields mineral explorer in that income year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has circulated an amendment to this bill. The amendment will require the minister to instigate an annual impact assessment of the measure with provision for public consultation, particularly including the industry. The amendment will also require the Commissioner of Taxation to make publicly available the ABN and name of an entity receiving credits and the amount of credits given. This amendment will enhance transparency and rigorous policy evaluation to ensure these initiatives work as intended. I will discuss Labor's proposed amendment in further detail during the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also take the opportunity to note that we will be supporting this bill. I want to add some final points, however, about this measure's relevance to Western Australia in a broader context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister announced the Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive in September last year whilst in Western Australia at the WA Liberal state conference. The timing is interesting. I note that the government continues to foster great uncertainty about the GST distributions for Australian states and territories. I also note that the government announced early in January that it would delay the Productivity Commission's final report on GST distribution. Such announcements are a reminder that it's only a Shorten Labor government that would actually have a plan to help fix Western Australia's unfair GST revenue share. As my colleague the shadow Treasurer said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let's be clear, today's announcement by Scott Morrison of a delay in the final Productivity Commission report, snuck out during the holiday period, is designed to do one thing—to try and hoodwink the people of South Australia and Tasmania that there won't be cuts to the GST revenue that help fund their hospitals and schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The uncertainty that will result from this delay will jeopardise the funding of services across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In October, Scott Morrison firmly embraced the Productivity Commission's draft recommendations which would see South Australia lose $256 million and Tasmania lose $77 million in funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor has a very clear plan to give WA its fair share—without punishing the people of Tasmania and South Australia, who, in a remarkable coincidence, happen to have had elections before the new reporting date for the GST review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times, the share of the GST pool going to WA has collapsed—in fact, to historic lows—and it's clear that this is not sustainable, and certainly it is not fair. At a time when WA is struggling to regain economic momentum after the sharp fall of mining related activity, the Abbott-Turnbull government, after four years in office, has still refused to act. Western Australia is receiving an extremely low share of the GST relativities, with the current year, 2017-18, at 34c in the dollar, topped up in the budget to 37.6c. That's the lowest that any state has received since the GST was introduced. This means that Western Australia is receiving 60 per cent less than what was the previous lowest rate received by any other state: 86.5c in the dollar by Victoria in the period 2004-05.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor will allocate $1.6 billion in Labor's first budget to establish the Fair Share for WA Fund, which would bring Western Australia up to the equivalent of 70c in the GST dollar from 1 July 2019, based on current relativities. This legislated fund would include a statutory obligation to invest all proceeds into Western Australian projects, helping to create jobs and boost economic activity for that state. All projects would be agreed upon between the federal and Western Australian governments. Federal Labor will also work closely with businesses, with unions and with community organisations in identifying projects that will boost the WA economy. This funding would be additional to current Commonwealth commitments to Western Australia, including the $2.3 billion package of projects announced in the 2017-18 budget and previous commitments such as NorthLink and the Mitchell Freeway extension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first time that a federal government or opposition has put forward a tangible policy response to resolve what has long been acknowledged: a problem with WA's share of the GST revenue. Federal Labor will also consider the final report of the Productivity Commission review of the GST distribution formula. But that's not an excuse for refusing to take action and provide funding certainty for WA now. Labor is able to make this investment as a result of policy announcements that make our tax system fairer and improve the budget position. These include reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, closing loopholes for multinationals, dividend imputation reform, and limiting tax minimisation through income splitting from discretionary trusts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive) Bill. We'll be moving amendments to enhance the transparency of the measure in this bill. And I'm sure that, in ways, it will be a very significant assistance to WA, while the government continues to twiddle its thumbs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I rise to give the Greens' perspective on this piece of legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive) Bill 2017. I note the previous speaker's statement that Labor will be supporting the government on this legislation, so clearly it will pass. Nonetheless, I put on record the Greens' opposition to the legislation, partly because we believe that, as with the original mechanism that it's replacing, it won't operate particularly well, it's likely to be an inefficient use of public funds and it's not the best use of public funds given the investment that is needed in community infrastructure. It's estimated that this proposal will cost over $100 million over the forward estimates, and the Greens don't believe that it is a good, effective use of public funds. There were clearly many significant problems with the exploration development incentive, which this scheme basically replaces, and, whilst this bill may seek to reduce some of those problems, we believe that some of them still exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens recognise and support the contribution that appropriate, sustainable mining makes. Indeed, as I hope all senators noticed, just in the last week or two the Greens announced a comprehensive policy, via my colleague Senator Rice, with regard to dramatically accelerating Australia's use of electric cars. Clearly, enabling that to be done—enabling the expansion of our electric car fleet in Australia—requires exploration and mining to provide the resources. Similarly, there are significant parts of the mining industry where there is the opportunity for employment, in our own country as well as elsewhere, and for revenue to be raised out of these public assets, because of the significant boom in, and therefore the demand for, renewable energy. The significant expansion of the renewable energy sector is something the Greens have played a key, practical role in through ensuring the provision of a legislative structure backed by appropriate amounts of public resourcing. In my own state of Queensland we've seen thousands of jobs created as a direct result of the Greens' efforts in this parliament in the renewable energy space. It is creating ongoing, long-term employment opportunities in regional Queensland as well as in many other parts of the country. Of course, renewable energy—whether it's solar panels or whether it's batteries—requires resources that are extracted through mining, so mining is a key part of bringing about the policies the Greens support. What we don't support is taxpayer money being provided, particularly in an inefficient way, to prop up exploration and to enable people basically to have a pay-back for their tax write-offs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start, this bill is going to pass—we recognise that. But one thing we do want to ensure is that this bill, when it does pass into law, doesn't make available any of these subsidies for exploration for thermal coal, and I'll be moving an amendment to that effect in the committee stage of the debate. This legislation already exempts the junior minerals exploration incentive from being made available for exploration for petroleum and shale, so the principle that a particular mineral or resource can be exempt from this new scheme is already there in the legislation. What the Greens will propose is simply that thermal coal also be exempt from this exploration incentive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something, of course, that is the topic of hot political debate around the country, but particularly in my own state of Queensland, where there is continuing pressure and where, as we speak, the state Labor government is offering up another round of tenders for thermal coal exploration in Queensland. There is continuing pressure to open up new coal deposits in Queensland, even though that will actually detract from existing jobs in the coal industry in regional Queensland and in other parts of the country. Workers already employed in the coal industry are already suffering from exploitation by mining companies. Giant multinational corporations are using more and more exploitative employment techniques. They are forcing more and more people onto temporary jobs, using more and more contract labour and forcing down the conditions of workers in the coalmining industry in Queensland and elsewhere, and yet we have this continual push to open up more coal deposits. This is driven, of course, by the fact that the mining corporations are embedded deeply in our political establishment in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the last thing we should be doing is having a new exploration incentive scheme that provides subsidies for any form of thermal coal exploration. This is a simple amendment that I'll speak to in a bit more detail when we get to the committee stage of the debate, but it's a simple way of sending a clear signal that the time for subsidising coal exploration and coalmining is over. That is close to an economic reality already; the last thing we should be doing is sending any signals that our structures and our mining incentives are still going to be made available for the fossil fuel industry. The legislation already exempts petroleum; it should exempt thermal coal as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I emphasise again that there is a significant role for the mining and resources industry? I say that as the Greens spokesperson for mining and resources, as well as for the environment. There is a significant problem with the inability—or the unwillingness, as well as the inability—of many mining companies to properly rehabilitate their mines after they've either used up the resource or just gone bust and left it there to fall to bits and to continue, in some cases, to poison the local environment and the local water table. There's a Senate inquiry into that at the moment, which I'm looking forward to seeing the final report on soon. But, clearly, there is a significant problem in adequately rehabilitating existing mine projects and ensuring that there is proper protection when mining does occur, both to ensure that there isn't unnecessary or unanticipated environmental damage and to ensure that there is proper rehabilitation, as should be required at any time a mining project operates. That is beyond the scope of this legislation. I accept that, so I won't go further on that at the moment, but that is a continuing problem and we shouldn't simply be looking to further expand exploration and development of the mining sector without ensuring that the existing problems, which have been well identified for decades now, are properly addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say this again: job opportunities in regional areas are another area where there is significant opportunity in properly rehabilitating existing mines and abandoned mines. There are significant employment opportunities there if mining corporations simply did the thing they were supposed to do, and which they are often legally obligated to do but they nonetheless walk away from. Where they have simply disappeared into the dust, as some of them do, governments could pick up the slack, ensure that in the interests of those communities there is not ongoing poisoning of the local environment, and provide employment opportunities for people in those regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens do recognise the importance of ensuring that there are viable community-building, sustainable employment opportunities in regional areas. That's why we reject the unviable boom-bust approach that's happened through the thermal coal industry in Queensland and elsewhere; that's why we reject further subsidising of that industry; and that's why, amongst other reasons, we don't support this legislation.</span>

It's important because it's of a particular policy significance to my home state of Western Australia. It's hard to overstate the significance of the mining industry's contribution to the Australian economy. The Australian minerals industry's contribution to local communities, regions and the nation is substantial, wide-ranging and enduring. This contribution flows from exploration and development right through to production and ultimately mine closure. It's an industry that contributes at least 10 per cent of the GDP in Australia; provides more than 200,000 highly paid, highly skilled jobs, mainly in regional and remote Australia, and many hundreds of thousands more in supply and service industries across our economy; has also developed productive and rewarding relationships within Indigenous communities across Australia; and is committed to leading practice in innovation, safety performance and environmental management.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly so in the mine development for new tech metals such as lithium, which is used in smartphones, laptops, digital computers and cameras. Also from the KPMG report, University of Western Australia researchers:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Although world mineral exploration expenditure for non-ferrous commodities has been recovering strongly from its low in 2009 and is back on the rising trend which commenced in 2002, Australia has continued to lose ground relative to other global and competitive exploration destinations. Australia's share of global exploration for non-bulk commodities has virtually halved from its peak of 21% in 2002 and it now stands at a mere 12% of the total, while that of Canada, for instance, has increased from 14% to 18% over the same period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this alarming statistic, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has said mineral exploration expenditure was $1.6 billion in 2016-17, up from $1.4 billion in 2015-16. My home state of Western Australia contributed over a billion dollars of this spend, with the gold and iron ore sectors attracting the largest share. Gold exploration expenditure in Western Australia increased significantly from $385.9 million in 2015-16 to $509.5 million in 2016-17. Iron ore exploration also increased, but only marginally at $281.6 million.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The state of greenfields mineral exploration activity in Australia is not as healthy as the headline figures might suggest. While there has been growth in expenditure, the level of drilling activity in this sector has remained flat over the last decade.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week, total metres drilled in the search for new deposits fell by nine per cent from 841,600 in the September quarter to just 766,100 in the three months to the end of December. Total metres drilled in brownfields also fell by 2.9 per cent from 1.45 to 1.1 million. The falls in drilling come despite a 4.4 per cent rise in exploration expenditure to almost $500 million. As AMEC's chief executive, Warren Pearce, was quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span>:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fall in metres drilled was also concerning given big new discoveries were more likely to be found at depth, with most shallow deposits already in production or mined out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Pearce said while the overall picture was positive and he expected the figures to improve this quarter, the pipeline of new projects coming online in the next few years was not strong.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">He noted a continuing bias towards exploration around existing deposits, with 67 per cent of drilling happening in already-explored brownfields locations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exploration for minerals involves significant expenditure and risks. While larger established mining companies are generally in a position to fund such activities from their own profits, smaller companies focused solely on exploration are dependent on attracting investment to fund their activities. Such smaller companies are also more likely to engage in more speculative mineral exploration in greenfield areas, rather than focusing on the development of their existing resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the problem is that the banking sector has all but disappeared from the junior exploration market, due largely, still, to the fallout from the European debt crisis, forcing many junior miners to seek financing from larger miners or from outside investors. David Harquail, chair of the World Gold Council and chief executive of international mining investment company Franco-Nevada, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the global financial crisis, the number of project lenders in the mining industry dropped to where you can count them on your fingers. What’s happening now is all the European banks now have just dropped off …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just as big pharmaceutical companies rely on small biotechs to discover new drug candidates, big mining companies need junior explorers to find new deposits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But just as investors have gone cold on pharmaceutical companies that invest in early-stage drug discovery, so too have they abandoned junior exploration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So says David Harquail, a clear expert when it comes to the funding and financing of resource exploration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Arguably, the tax arrangements have not encouraged investment in Australian greenfield mineral exploration projects to date. This junior mineral exploration tax credit arrangement is an incentive for shareholders investing in greenfield exploration companies who undertake new capital raisings. The key benefit of this initiative will be for the ability of certain companies to undertake greenfield exploration, to renounce their losses and, instead, pass future tax deductions to Australian resident investors. Alternatively, companies can choose to retain their tax losses for utilisation when they make profits from a successful mine. The junior minerals exploration tax credit will be capped at $100 million and will be available on a first in, first served basis. Companies undertaking greenfield exploration can elect to give up a portion of their tax losses relating to eligible exploration expenditure in an income year and pass on tax credits to their Australian resident investors. Tax credits capable of being passed to investors are expected to be the lesser of the explorer's tax loss or the greenfield exploration expenditure for the previous income year, multiplied by the corporate tax rate for that year. Similar to the franking system, the credit will flow through to investors and be available for the income year following the one in which the eligible expenditure is incurred by the company. Access to tax credits will not hinge on the investor having taxable income in the relevant year, as excess tax credits are expected to be refundable to certain Australian resident investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the previous Exploration Development Incentive scheme, eligibility for the junior minerals exploration tax credit is limited to investors that purchase newly issued shares and is allocated between eligible exploration companies on a first come, first served basis, subject of course to necessary integrity requirements. The previous EDI was typically applied to all shareholders, which diluted the benefit of the scheme. I think that was widely recognised as a significant flaw in the success of the original model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given exploration companies have a choice to use the junior minerals exploration tax credit at the time of capital raisings, it's suspected that companies will be required to make a declaration to the market of the company's intention to retain exploration related losses or to use the JMETC. If successful, the incentive should attract much-needed capital investment to junior explorers undertaking greenfield exploration and, importantly, open up the potential for new discoveries by encouraging explorers to venture into areas they otherwise may not have considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a senator for Western Australia, I support the bill, which will go a long way to securing continued investment in greenfield mineral exploration. I look forward to playing my part in working with colleagues to ensure the Australian mining industry remains a strong and significant contributor to our national economic prosperity and to resource based states like my home state of Western Australia for many decades to come.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  I thank Senator Dean Smith, who is from that other great mining state of Western Australia, for explaining the provisions of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive) Bill 2017 in some detail. Also, I thank Senator Smith for the statistics that he was able to give to the chamber indicating the need for some encouragement to explore for minerals in our great country. I don't want to take a great deal of the Senate's time. I simply want to thank the government and congratulate the minister for introducing this new incentive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mining means so much to Australia, particularly Queensland and Western Australia. My state of Queensland, like Western Australia, has been developed on the back of our mining industries. Our mining industries have created huge employment opportunities for Queenslanders, for Western Australians and, indeed, for all Australians. But, over the years, there has been a slowdown in the exploration that's needed to find the mineral resources before we can actually start mining them and creating the jobs. I think it's almost 20 years since there's been a world-class mineral discovery in our country. I remember well the days of 'the Poseidon adventure', as I call it. That was the name of a movie, but the real Poseidon adventure was the discovery of nickel deposits in Western Australia which sparked a share boom and attracted a lot of mum and dad investors into putting money into minerals exploration. But there hasn't been a lot of exploration in recent years; the amount of exploration in our country has suffered substantially. Consequently, when we don't find the resources we can't develop them and create jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some time ago the coalition government did introduce a scheme to allow the flow-through of losses to shareholder investors in minerals exploration companies. It was a good idea at the time, but it hasn't really worked. Hence we have this new arrangement which I am hopeful will encourage Australians to invest their money in risk investments but with the hope of obtaining big rewards on the discovery of a mineral resource and its subsequent development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The banks in Australia these days are very shy of any sort of support for mining companies and mining exploration. Because of that, we have to encourage the mum and dad investors and the superannuation funds to invest their equity in junior mining companies that can go out and survey the length and breadth of our vast country to try and find the sort of bonanza—the El Dorado, the Poseidon—that has made Australia great in the past. As a country, we have enormous mineral resources. We are of that age as a geographic entity that there are a lot of minerals somewhere beneath the ground. But what we've got to do is find them and then develop them. Unless we have people who are prepared to invest in that, it's going to be difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is simply about encouraging investors to invest in these junior exploration companies. That gives them the ability to wander throughout Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory looking for these minerals. We hope that some of that exploration will come to fruition and we will be able to establish new mining industries and, therefore, new jobs for Australians. To do that we have to encourage that investment. And by giving tax breaks to the mum-and-dad investors, and even the superannuation fund investors, who are prepared to take these risk investments, that may lead to a worthwhile result in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be able to support this bill. As a Queenslander, as someone from north Queensland who spends a lot of time out in the mining areas of the north and west of our state, I'm delighted that the government has heeded the call, many calls over a long period of time, for some assistance to encourage more investment in these junior explorers. I congratulate the minister and the government as a whole. I look forward to this particular bill playing a real part in finding and developing new discoveries of minerals in our country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I'd like to thank those senators who have contributed to this important debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive) Bill 2017. This bill provides a tax incentive for small minerals exploration companies to encourage investment and risk-taking, which are needed to help underpin the future strength of our resources sector and the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian resident investors in small minerals exploration companies will receive a refundable tax offset where the exploration company chooses to give up a portion of their losses relating to their greenfields minerals expenditure in an income year. To encourage investment, only newly issued shares relating to capital raising for investment in new greenfields exploration activity will be eligible for these credits. Credits of up to $100 million over four years will be made available on a first-in, first-served basis. This improves on the previous program assisting junior explorers, creating a more stable platform for investor confidence to help these explorers raise the capital they need to get on with the job of finding tomorrow's mines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the incentive, amendments to the excess exploration credit tax aim to deter an exploration company from distributing more exploration credits than they are entitled to. The government will move amendments to the bill to clarify the operation of the scheme. These amendments adjust the period for junior explorers to apply for an allocation, exploration of credits, in the first year of the incentive. The amendments also clarify when a junior explorer has an unused allocation of credits. The government will agree to amendments moved by the Labor Party to provide extra certainty that the incentive operates as intended in encouraging greenfields minerals exploration. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

Under the Bill, the minerals explorer may apply for an exploration credits allocation for a particular year and cannot issue more credits than allocated. The minerals explorer also cannot issue more exploration credits for an income year than would relate to investment in the minerals explorer during that year. However, if allocation is not used up in one year, investors in that year are given priority in the following year, up to the limit of the unused allocation of exploration credits. Because the allocation of exploration credits for the first year may exceed the amount of exploration credits that would relate to investment in that year, investors in the second year may miss out on exploration credits that could never have been issued to first year investors anyway. </span>

As a result, the amount of exploration credits that may result in a refundable tax offset is greater under the amendment than it would be under the Bill (and, given that the Bill extends the offset over 4 more years, under the Act). </span>

                    </a>  These two technical amendments are proposed to clarify the operation of the new scheme. The amendments adjust the application period for the 2017-18 income year. The bill previously provided that junior explorers could apply to the ATO from 1 February 2018 for an allocation of credits. It is necessary to adjust the application period as this time frame has passed. The new application period will begin on 11th business day after this bill receives royal assent, or the day of the commencement of the amendments if this is later. Applications will be open for a month. Under the JMEI, the Commissioner of Taxation allocates credits between junior explorers on a first come, first served basis until the annual exploration cap for an income year is reached. The amendments clarify the definition of 'unused allocation of exploration credits' to ensure the scheme operates as intended. Where an explorer raises less capital than expended, they will not be prevented from issuing credits to investors in the following year, to the extent of the shortfall. For example, where an explorer receives an allocation of credits to raise $1 million of capital but is only able to raise $600,000 of capital, only those credits that relate to the $600,000 can be issued to investors. Those credits need to be issued to first-year investors before credits can be issued to investors in subsequent years.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 8384, as circulated in my name:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very simple amendment, on which I elaborated to some extent in my second reading contribution, so I won't go over all of that again. As the bill currently stands—and as we all know this bill will become law fairly soon, as it is going to pass—it exempts the incentive from being made available to exploration or prospecting for petroleum or oil shale. All this amendment seeks to do is to ensure that thermal coal is also exempt from being eligible for this exploration incentive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for coal in Australia is over, and we need to be recognising that. We need to be recognising that we do not need to be putting any more public resources into continuing to explore for new thermal coal deposits. We need to be transitioning away from coal. We need to be ensuring that all of our communities that in the past have had some economic benefit from these industries are able to transition effectively, that the workers are able to transition effectively and the communities are able to be provided with other economic opportunities, many of which are already there and many of which need support and investment to develop more effectively and more sustainably. There is a lot of debate of course in my own state of Queensland—an argument regarding the future of the thermal coal industry. The Greens' position on that is unequivocally clear, and we think it's about time the parliament's position on that was made unequivocally clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are alternative economic futures for regional communities. They are ones that are better both in terms of employment opportunities and in terms of more solid and stable communities. So much of the profit from coal in the past has gone to overseas corporations, many of which have managed to avoid tax. The harm done by the boom-bust component of the last mining boom to communities in regional Queensland is quite significant. I know my Greens colleagues could talk about other states as well. But it caused quite significant social and community damage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got $100 million-plus available here. That money could be invested far more effectively in economic opportunities that are far more stable and suited for communities. It also should not be being spent in any way to encourage further exploration of thermal coal. We should not be opening up existing coal deposits that have already been identified. We still do not have a clear position from the Queensland government about whether they do or do not support the Adani coalmine. We do not have a clear position from the Queensland government on whether they do or do not support opening up the whole new massive coal deposits in the Galilee Basin. As I said in my second reading contribution, any further expansion of that will predominantly have a harmful effect on existing coal jobs. We need to be supporting people who are in existing employment and providing assistance for a smooth transition for those workers, many of whom are already being inappropriately exploited by overseas mining corporations, due in part to the inadequacies under our existing so-called Fair Work Act and the inadequacies of our existing industrial relations laws. The last thing we should be doing is providing more taxpayer money to subsidise exploration to identify more thermal coal deposits. That's why the Greens are moving this amendment. It's a pretty straightforward one and I certainly would encourage other parties to support it.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. Labor will not be supporting the Greens amendment. We heard some extraordinary words from Senator Bartlett here this morning. The reality is that over the five years to 2015-16 expenditure on greenfield exploration around Australia dropped by 70 per cent. That's just a fact. It's a reality that the Greens seem to be completely unaware of. We heard the member stand up and say that they support mining and exploration, but they don't. And clearly they have decided on a strategy here today that for media simplicity they're going to oppose this legislation. We heard Senator Bartlett say that $100 million is not a good investment, despite the reality of that maximum decline in exploration—70 per cent—in the last five years, up to 2015-16. We need to be doing something for people in the regions who actually require sound investment in exploration. If the Greens want to be taken seriously and to genuinely participate in the debate around mining, they need to engage with stakeholders, and we know that hasn't been the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the party that, I'm very proud to say, has been very much involved in facilitating a timely review of this scheme. Our amendments, which I'll move shortly, will seek to do that careful review of the investment in exploration into the future. We actually believe in and support evidence based policymaking. We understand that the mining sector is broad, that it employs a lot of Australians in regional parts of the country. Labor takes the mining sector seriously, Labor takes jobs seriously and Labor takes regional Australia seriously. The Greens need to engage much more seriously with the opportunity to grow jobs in a sustainable way throughout the regions of Australia, and this piece of legislation seeks to do that in an evidence based and careful way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  The government doesn't support the amendment proposed by the Greens, which would exclude exploration or prospecting for thermal coal, typically used for power generation, from the junior minerals exploration incentive. In line with the exploration development incentive, the JMEI is designed to encourage greenfields exploration for minerals, excluding petroleum and oil shale. Much of Australia's petroleum and oil exploration occurs offshore. However, this incentive is focused on encouraging exploration onshore. The government does not support unnecessarily narrowing the JMEI based on anti-coal rhetoric. Narrowing the scheme would deny junior explorers the ability to convert a tax loss from exploration or prospecting for thermal coal into a tax benefit that can be distributed to new investors. This would detract from the scheme's objective, which is to contribute to a better investment climate in the sector and an improved likelihood of mineral discovery for the benefit of the Australian economy and the benefit of jobs in the Australian economy. We therefore oppose the amendment.</span>

It's disappointing but not surprising that the government doesn't support this; it's simply disappointing that Labor is not supporting this. Senator O'Neill's comment did not go to the heart of the amendment, which is a simple one; it went to the broader nature of the legislation. They were valid comments to make, but not with regard to this amendment. This amendment is simple: it seeks to ensure that taxpayer money is not made available to subsidise exploration for thermal coal. That's all it will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Neill talked about people being taken seriously. This is a simple matter about whether Labor want to be taken seriously on their commitment to move away from fossil fuels. As the minister himself just outlined, this exploration incentive regime does not apply to petroleum or oil shale at the moment. The Greens simply want to make sure it does not apply also to exploration for thermal coal. It's a very simple amendment. If you support ensuring that we do not further expand subsidising exploration for thermal coal, you'll vote yes to this amendment. If you support more subsidies being made available to explore for thermal coal, you'll vote no. It's very disappointing that Labor appears to be going to vote no.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the new explanatory memorandum, in early 2017 participants in the Exploration Development Incentive and other stakeholders were formally requested to provide feedback on the performance of the exploration development incentive, and this informed the basis for consultation on improving the scheme. The explanatory memorandum states that the government engaged with industry bodies, shareholder representatives, departments and state governments. Although feedback was incorporated into the new scheme, the materials are not public and the explanatory memorandum does not give any detail of impact or uplift of exploration.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supported the passage of the exploration development incentive legislation, and I note for the record that we're supportive of this bill. Consistent with Labor's approach to evidence based policy, Labor is moving these amendments in the Senate today to require the minister to instigate an annual impact assessment of the measure, with provision for public consultation, particularly including industry. The amendments will also require the Commissioner of Taxation to make publicly available the ABN and name of an entity receiving credits and the amount of credits given. This is important. It will enable the sector to see more clearly and in a more timely way exactly what's going on. Labor believes in transparency and rigorous policy evaluation to ensure that initiatives work as intended, and the amendments proposed by Labor today will achieve that end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note that the government has indicated that they will support the amendments. I and the shadow Assistant Treasurer wish to thank the government for their good-faith discussions around these amendments. Labor's amendments will give extra certainty to all stakeholders, including industry and taxpayers, that the measures operate as intended. Rigorous policy evaluation helps to guide targeted initiatives in future and ensures the best bang for the taxpayer buck on investment and jobs. I commend the amendments to the committee.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I rise to speak on these two bills, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017-2018 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2017-2018, before us in the Senate today, which are required to ensure the ordinary functioning of government continues for the remainder of the 2017-18 financial year and facilitate a number of 2017-18 MYEFO measures. The package of bills appropriate about $1.5 billion from consolidated revenue in addition to the appropriation acts passed in June 2017. These amounts are already incorporated into the budget bottom line as presented in the 2017-18 MYEFO—I can see Senator Leyonhjelm laughing already. I wonder how he pronounces it. I'm sure we'll find out next.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we won't stand in the way of supply. These bills also go to the government's broader management of the nation's finances. We remind those opposite of what the Prime Minister has said on debt in the past. When he was Leader of the Opposition in 2009 he described $200 billion in debt as 'frightening' and promised the Liberals wouldn't 'run willy-nilly into debt'. He described $300 billion in projected gross debt as 'gigantic' and an 'almost inconceivable level of debt' and tried to scaremonger about the debt level with his runner analogy: 'There should be no lead weights put in his pockets or heavy backpacks put on his back.' Yet that is what the government is delivering to us with these higher and higher levels of debt. Surprisingly, the Prime Minister hasn't been as colourful about his own record on debt. On the Turnbull government's watch, gross debt has crashed through half a trillion for the first time in the country's history.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FARRELL:</span>
                    </a>  Yes, it is a shame, Acting Whip. Gross debt is currently above $518 billion with no signs of slowing down, and doesn't peak in the government's own budget papers. Net debt has doubled under this government and will hit record highs for the next three years. That is not to mention that the deficit for this year is $23.6 billion, eight times higher than the $2.8 billion the Liberals first predicted in their 2014 horror budget. I know you are interested in that, Madam Acting Deputy President, so I'll repeat those figures. The deficit for this year is eight times higher than the Liberals had predicted in their first horror budget of 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Prime Minister is more reluctant to speak about debt and deficit blowouts on his watch than he was back in 2009. But his Assistant Treasurer, the member for Deakin, was happy to help out, saying it was 'a truckload of debt, an absolutely extraordinary amount of debt'—I don't think the opposition could have said it better! But what is more extraordinary is how quickly the coalition have racked up this truckload of debt. The coalition, under Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott, have racked up debt much faster than during the Rudd-Gillard years. Gross debt has increased by $39 million a day quicker. Net debt has increased by $21 million a day quicker. And the government can't blame this on the global economy as global conditions are the best we've seen in a decade. The International Monetary Fund's most recent World Economic Outlook Update—this is for January 2018—says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Global economic activity continues to firm up. Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and ½ percentage point higher than in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the government is still racking up debt quicker, in good economic conditions, than occurred under Labor, when we had the global financial crisis to contend with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The state of the budget under the Liberals comes down to one key point: the Liberals are obsessed with pandering to the top end of town. This attitude hurts the budget, hurts the economy and comes at the expense of people who work and struggle to make ends meet. The latest Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook is a perfect example of the Liberals' elitist and out-of-touch approach, with higher taxes for workers, lower taxes for multinationals and millionaires, and record and growing debt. Whenever the Liberals do attempt fiscal repair, it is always at the expense of vulnerable people. They are ripping away funding and support for students and universities. There is a $34 billion hike on the seven million low- and middle-income earners in Australia. They want to ditch the energy supplement, which would leave pensioners up to $366 a year worse off, and increase the pension age to 70, which will mean Australia will have an older pension age than the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand. It will also mean that 375,000 Australians will have to wait longer to access a pension in the first four years alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But for the clearest example of the Liberals pandering to the top end of town we need look no further than the $65 billion tax cut for big multinationals and the big banks. This is a $65 billion ram raid on the budget. It is $65 billion taken out of funding for education, health and the pockets of middle Australia—and $10 billion of that is going to the big banks. The economics of this don't stack up. Treasury modelling shows a one per cent boost to GDP in 20 years time—an average of 0.05 per cent a year. A report by the Australia Institute highlighted the lack of evidence between the tax cut and increased jobs or growth. The Grattan Institute has warned that national income would be reduced for years and that, by committing to the handout before fixing the budget, the government risks reducing future living standards. To quote that think tank:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An unfunded company tax cut would add to already-large budget deficits … any cut to the company tax rate should only be implemented as part of a wider tax (and spending) reform package that does not increase budget deficits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax cut is a kick in the face for people struggling to make ends meet. Ordinary Australians don't want to see the biggest companies get tax concessions they don't need at the expense of their own living standards. Polling from The Australia Institute also shows that the majority of people—that is, 58 per cent—don't support the $65 billion big business tax cut. And, more significantly, I guess, a recent Guardian Essential poll showed that 42 per cent versus 30 per cent rejected the claim that a corporate tax cut would lead to higher wages. It also showed that more people—38 per cent to 32 per cent—thought that cutting the company tax rate would simply deliver more profits to the business bottom line, rather than attract investment and create more jobs and higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's pandering to the top end of town is not just exclusive to the big business tax giveaway, it applies to other areas as well. The government has given tax cuts to those who need them the least: a $16,400 tax cut to millionaires. It's also not willing to reform other areas, like trusts, negative gearing, capital gains tax and superannuation, that advantage the top end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, under the Liberals, more than half of the superannuation concessions go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. Peter Martin from Fairfax summarised it well recently, when he said in an article:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The biggest superannuation and capital gains tax concessions are directed towards the highest earners, something we wouldn't tolerate if they were delivered as cheques, paid into accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's elitist and out-of-touch approach is as concerning for the economy as it is for the budget. As I said, the global economy is going strong, and our domestic headline rate would suggest that things are good here too. The national accounts show that Australia's GDP growth for the year to the December quarter was 2.4 per cent. However, the headline figure doesn't give a sense of how we're slipping in a global context. Australia has gone from leader to laggard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our response to the global financial crisis meant that we overperformed in what was an horrific global context, and we were only one of two advanced economies to do so. Between 2008 and 2010, Australia had the fourth-highest GDP growth among all OECD countries, with the US, the UK, Japan, and Germany all contracting over that period of time. The latest comparative data shows that Australia has now slumped to 20th among the OECD, behind likes of Mexico, Estonia, Finland and Latvia. I can see that you are shocked, there, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, and I am too! I'll repeat those countries: we've now slumped to 20th among the OECD, behind likes of Mexico, Estonia, Finland and Latvia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The headline figure also masks some enduring, and indeed concerning, underlying trends in our economy which are disproportionately hurting some more than others. A lot of people feel, with some justification, that the rules of the economy are written to benefit others at their expense. That makes sense when you consider that inequality is at a 75-year high and that the gender pay gap is widening, with a recent World Economic Forum report ranking Australia 42 out of 144 countries, falling from 12th position a decade earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This economic disconnect is most prevalent in the world of work and wages. The link between hard work and reward has been severed. Wages grew by two per cent, consistently hovering around record lows. The unemployment rate is at 5.5 per cent, a level comparable to the peak of the global financial crisis. With near-record underemployment, Australians want more work, but they cannot get it. On top of these economic pressures, the Liberals are worsening the situation by supporting penalty rate cuts. These cuts hurt our lowest-paid workers—with some 700,000 impacted—with workers losing up to $77 a week, and have a disproportionate effect on female workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Bank of Australia's chief economist, Michael Blythe, wrote about the wages recession in his economic issues note. He spoke about the weakness in wages growth as a significant economic risk, with impacts on households and businesses. Mr Blythe notes that weakness in household incomes remains a major threat to consumer activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals are simply pandering to the top end of town, and it's best displayed with their $65 billion big business tax cuts. This policy sharpens the difference between the Labor Party on this side and those opposite. We know you can't grow the economy by favouring the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia. This is a government that thinks big multinational corporations pay too much tax, seven million working Australians pay too little tax and people get paid too much to work on weekends. These are all absurd propositions, and they are the reasons why ordinary Australians reject the Turnbull government's trickle-down economic agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Labor Party know that growth has to be inclusive. If you're serious about growing the economy, you have to invest in people and their productivity, you have to make sure people are rewarded for effort and you have to ensure that people have money to spend in the economy and can provide for their families. That attitude to growth also underpins our fiscal approach: we believe in budget repair, but it has to be fair. Unlike those opposite, we don't ask the most vulnerable to carry the can when it comes to getting the budget back to balance. That's why we've announced a raft of responsible savings that significantly improve the budget over the medium term.

I know the opposition won't be joining me, given what happened to Gough Whitlam in 1975 and having just heard Senator Farrell say as much. But this budget should be blocked. It gives rise to high tax, deficit and debt, and it's causing great damage to our country. If the budget were blocked, the government would be forced to go back to the drawing board to prepare a budget with reduced government spending. While this occurred, government spending would be interrupted. This would cause short-term pain. But the benefit from a new budget with reduced government spending would be significant and enduring.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this budget will pass, despite my opposition, I also propose an amendment. In presenting these two budget bills before the Senate today, the government is violating the Constitution and usurping the rights of the Senate. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills alerted the Senate to this in its second digest of 2018. In this digest the committee noted that the government's policy to spend $7 million on the Menzies Institute and Library is a new policy announced in December's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook—and Senator Farrell's not here, so I don't have to pronounce that more appropriately than he did! The committee noted that as it is a new policy the Senate should be able to amend the appropriation for this policy. The constitutional bar on the Senate amending appropriation applies only to appropriations for ongoing policy. Yet the committee noted that the government has decided not to insert the appropriation for this new policy into Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which contains other appropriations for new policy. Instead, the government has inserted the appropriation for this new policy into Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which contains appropriations for ongoing policy. Section 54 of the Constitution makes it clear that bills containing appropriations for ongoing policy should contain only such appropriations. Only then are such bills immune from amendment by the Senate.</span>

If you believe the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which is chaired by Labor Senator Polley, co-chaired by Nationals Senator Williams and includes members such as the Greens' Senator Rice, then you must consider the spending on the Menzies Institute and Library to be a new policy. If you believe that the Constitution should be upheld, then you must support removing the appropriation for this new policy from the No. 3 bill, which contains appropriations for ongoing policy. It should instead be placed in the No. 4 bill, which does not contain appropriations for ongoing policy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017-18 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2017-18. These two bills provide appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of the government for the remainder of 2017-18 and facilitate implementation of a number of 2017-18 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, or MYEFO, measures. The government is seeking to appropriate a total of around $1.5 billion for the remainder of the 2017-18 financial year. These amounts have already been incorporated into the budget bottom line as presented in the 2017-18 MYEFO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor Party will be supporting these bills, the debate today gives us an opportunity to highlight the flaws in the 2017-18 budget and the misplaced priorities of this chaotic Turnbull government. Let's be clear at the outset: it's big multinational businesses and millionaires who get all the goodies from the Turnbull government, not the low- to middle-income Australians who could do with some additional support. The recent MYEFO confirms that, instead of making the right decision to rein in generous tax breaks for the top end of town, Mr Turnbull, Mr Morrison and Senator Cormann are once again asking those who can least afford it to carry the can for the government's budget failures. The government prefer to rip away funding and support for students and universities in an attempt to fix their budget mess rather than ditch their tax breaks for the top end of town. They are effectively delivering their $65 billion handout to multinationals and the banks by increasing the tax burden on low- and middle-income earners. Not only is Mr Turnbull's budget elitist and out of touch; it doesn't make any fiscal or economic sense either. The government's budget delivers tax handouts for multinationals and millionaires while hurting Australian families. The mid-year budget update is, at its core, a triple whammy of higher taxes for workers, lower taxes for the top end of town, and record and growing debt. It also shows that Liberals still want to ditch the energy supplement for pensioners and increase the pension age to 70.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government, like all Liberal governments, continue to perpetuate the myth that they're better economic managers than Labor, but they have overseen an exponential increase in Australia's levels of debt and deficit. This year's deficit has blown out by a factor of eight times. In the 2014-15 budget, the 2017-18 deficit was projected to be $2.8 billion; however, the deficit is now $23.6 billion in the 2017-18 MYEFO. Net debt has also more than doubled since the Liberals took office. Net debt was $175 billion in September 2013 and had risen to $353 billion in January 2018. Net debt is also expected to reach new highs over each of the next three years. Gross debt has also spiked under this government. It's now more than half a trillion dollars. It has never been higher and is growing, with no peak in sight. While those opposite inherited gross debt of $280 billion, it has blown out to $518 billion as at 9 March 2018. Gross debt is currently estimated to reach $684 billion in 2027-28. Both gross debt and net debt are also growing faster under the Liberals than under Labor—and this coming from a government who in opposition told Australians that they were facing a 'budget crisis' and a 'debt and deficit disaster'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These figures absolutely rubbish any argument that those on the government team are better economic managers. Rather than fixing Australia's debt, the Liberal-National government's policies are making it worse. As at 9 March 2018, gross debt was growing at $1.2 billion a month quicker, and net debt $575 million a month quicker, than when Labor was in power. This is despite the positive global conditions the government is currently working within, after Labor saved the country from the global financial crisis. The government has tried to talk up some modest and expected minor improvements in the budget, but the substantial uptick in global economic conditions in recent times means they should have expected nothing less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact remains that the headline numbers in this year's MYEFO are nothing to be proud of. International comparisons show other countries are capitalising on improving global conditions better than we are. According to the latest OECD data, Australia ranks 20th in terms of GDP growth among member states, behind the likes of Mexico, Estonia, Finland and Latvia. I say we can and we must do better. As a comparison, understand that in the two years to 2010, during the peak of the global financial crisis, we were ranked fourth highest in the OECD with GDP growth of 4.6 per cent over that period. At the same time the economies of similar countries like the US, the UK, Japan and Germany were contracting. Given this current underperformance, it does makes sense why the Liberals chose to release the update just before Christmas, when Australians were more focused on their festive season than they were on the nation's finances. Sadly, our nation's economy is underperforming in the best global conditions in a decade, when it wasn't long ago that we were overperforming in a very difficult global context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, some of the underlying data gives us cause for concern, particularly in how it reflects the economic reality for large swathes of the community. Wages have stagnated under this government, yet there are greater and greater tax cuts to multinationals and to millionaires. This government shouldn't be cutting company tax for those huge companies; it should be making them pay their fair share in the first place. Australia's philosophy of the 'fair go' that guarantees fair wages for a fair day's work has been severed. The fact is that, over the past year, company profits have grown by 20 per cent but wages have grown by just two per cent. Isn't the rising tide meant to lift all boats equally? According to the flawed trickle-down theory of economics that those opposite subscribe to, that's how it's meant to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest national accounts show that in just the last two years the wages share of income has fallen 1.5 percentage points while the profits share has grown 2.3 percentage points over the same period. We want strong profits and we want sustainable wages growth as well. On top of that, more precarious and insecure work and very high underemployment, which has almost 1.1 million Australians not getting enough hours of work, are making life harder for many people on modest incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effects of all this are really obvious. Household consumption grew just 0.1 per cent in the September quarter—the worst quarterly result since the global financial crisis. The RBA points specifically to the decline in the growth of discretionary spending, on things such as eating out and recreation, as an indication of increased pressure on household finances. On top of that, the household-debt-to-income ratio is the highest it's ever been, and the household savings ratio is around the worst it's been for about a decade. All of this tells us that people don't have money to spend in the shops or to save for bigger purchases and are bogged down by debt—all of which has repercussions for businesses and the wider economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very clear that this government doesn't want to do anything to make the tax system fairer. It doesn't want to reform trusts or stop wealthy property investors from using tax concessions they don't need to lock first home buyers out of the housing market. All the while, the nation's debt keeps growing and growing. In fact, it's not well known or understood that debt is actually growing faster now under Mr Turnbull in favourable global economic conditions than it did under the former Labor government, which had the global financial crisis to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor has announced responsible savings that significantly improve the budget over the medium term, including ensuring multinationals pay their fair share and reforms to negative gearing, capital gains tax and trusts. Labor has found tens of billions of dollars in fair budget repair measures that don't ask the most vulnerable in our community to do the heavy lifting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's recently announced reforms on dividend imputation credits will also redirect an unsustainable tax refund, for people who pay no tax, into more productive areas. Dividend imputation is a proud Labor achievement. Paul Keating, as Treasurer, re-engineered capital formation in Australia by eliminating double taxation on company profits. Imputation is, and will continue to be, a vital part of our financial infrastructure. But John Howard and Peter Costello decided—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CORMANN:</span>
                  </a>  I thank the Senate. As Australians we know we live in a country whose landscape is unpredictable and where nature can bring us as much misery as it does joy. Sadly, this past weekend many of our fellow Australians have experienced that misery firsthand. Devastating bushfires have ravaged both Tathra on the South Coast of New South Wales and the Barwon South West district of Victoria. It is being reported that at least 88 homes have been destroyed, mainly in Tathra, but there remains the horrible prospect that there will be more, once we know the full scale of the disaster. Thankfully, there are no reports that lives have been lost, and I urge everyone in or near the bushfire areas to pay close attention to the advice of local authorities, to keep themselves as safe as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, our first concern is for the safety and needs of the people directly affected by these fires, especially those whose homes have been lost or damaged and the people who have been evacuated. The Australian government remains in contact with the New South Wales and Victorian governments and stands ready to provide any assistance requested to support these communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's emergency services are the best in the world, and, on behalf of the local communities hit by these terrible fires and all Australians, I express my heartfelt thanks to all the emergency service workers and volunteers who worked so tirelessly over the weekend and continue to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are already providing clean-up assistance in the Northern Territory after Cyclone Marcus hit Darwin and the Territory on Saturday. Again, the Australian government stands ready to provide any further assistance requested to support these communities, and I'm sure all of the people of Australia join me in expressing our sorrow for those hardest hit by these natural disasters and our hope that those in the affected areas continue to be safe.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:02</span>):  by leave—I thank Senator Cormann for his words and for the opportunity for the opposition to speak also today about terrible events that are, sadly, too familiar in this country. Perhaps few weekends more graphically illustrate that famous descriptor of Dorothea Mackellar's, of our land being one of beauty and terror and flood and fire. At one end of the country, we saw Cyclone Marcus, which swept through Darwin and the Kimberley; at the other end, terrible fires destroyed homes, farms and businesses in Victoria and at Tathra on the New South Wales South Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good that there have been no deaths, only minor injuries, which, given the scale of these disasters, is extremely fortunate but also a tribute to the extraordinary skill and bravery of our emergency services workers and volunteers. Many homes and businesses stand today only because of their dedication and sacrifice, and we once again stand in their debt—the many thousands of people who consistently give up their time and risk their lives to help their fellow Australians at these times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The damage from Cyclone Marcus is mostly confined to power damage and trees down. However, sadly, in the bushfire areas, it is a different story. In Tathra, more than 70 homes and businesses have been destroyed by a fire that came so quickly and with such force that many of those who fled had no time to do anything other than escape with their lives. It's a beautiful town, beloved as a holiday destination, and the damage and loss will be felt by many who have fond memories of time spent at the famous Tathra pub, on the wharf or just relaxing at the beach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A short time before question time, I spoke to Mike Kelly, the local member for Eden-Monaro, who asked me to express three points in this contribution. Obviously, one is that there are many properties destroyed and damaged, and the assessment is still underway. He asked me to particularly pass on the thanks of the community to the very brave helicopter pilots who continued to engage in water bombing of the fire, in extremely difficult circumstances, as it approached the town. Finally, being a good fundraiser, he wanted me to make sure everybody knows there is a donation fund and to ask if we could please all contribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No less devastating, of course, are the losses in the south-western part of Victoria near Warrnambool, where at least 18 homes and businesses have been destroyed, along with a huge number of livestock, which will take a terrible toll on the farmers concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of this sort of loss and shock, we offer our words of comfort and our expressions of solidarity, but, of course, more is always needed. Government and communities are stepping forward in providing financial and emotional support. I thank my colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria for their quick response with financial and material aid and their pledges to ensure that the towns, farms and communities are not forgotten when these fires are out. Federal Labor stands ready to assist this government and the community in whatever way we can.</span>

Every time I pack up my bags and come to Canberra during summer, we know that there's a risk that I'm leaving my family in a situation that many of our neighbours are now facing. We've seen 18 homes destroyed around the towns of Terang, Garvoc, Camperdown and Gazette; 40,000 hectares burnt; a lot of livestock lost; and farmers who are now seriously suffering.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard this morning that in Tathra 70 homes and other buildings have been destroyed. Four people have been treated for smoke inhalation. We have seen a volunteer injured. And, by all accounts, we're extremely lucky that there have not been more casualties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard, on the other side of the country, in the Top End, Cyclone Marcus has rolled through Darwin and, luckily, while the impact has resulted in schools being closed, some services being shut and electricity being lost, there are no major casualties as a result of that cyclone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend all of those people in their local communities who have been affected by these disasters and who have rallied together to help each other. It's always, I think, interesting that when we're faced with adversity like this we see the best in people. We see people rallying together, helping their neighbours, ensuring that they're safe and, quite literally, giving them the shirt off their back. I want to pay tribute to the emergency service workers, many of whom are still working tirelessly to get fires under control, and those people in the Northern Territory who are cleaning up after Cyclone Marcus.</span>

If Victoria and New South Wales have proven one thing over the years, it is that your emergency service personnel in the fire brigades and Country Fire Authority have always put the safety of your communities first. I thank every one of you who have had sleepless nights defending life and property. Equally I say thank you for the preparation and training you all put in over your weekends to ensure the safety of your home states. To each of the farmers who have lost livestock, particularly around Cobden and Terang, I expect you to get every bit of help and assistance from my colleagues in this house to get back on your feet. My One Nation colleague, Senator Brian Burston, will be here for his New South Wales constituents, especially those in Tathra. It is not the first bushfire this country has had and it won't be the last. In this house we need to achieve agreement that those affected get our absolute support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  by leave—On behalf of the Nationals I join with the Leader of the Government, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and leaders of other parties in this place to acknowledge the natural disasters currently impacting upon many parts of our country. The bushfires have devastated a number of communities and have resulted in the destruction of schools and property around Victoria as well as the New South Wales coast. We should reflect for a minute that these are very small communities. Almost no-one who lives in these communities is not known to everyone else, along with their houses and properties. These events have a huge impact on small communities. I take this opportunity to add my tribute to the remarkable fire crews of the CFA in Victoria and the fire crews who work round the clock in New South Wales.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a senator for the Northern Territory I also acknowledge the impact Tropical Cyclone Marcus has had and continues to have on residents of Darwin, Palmerston, Coolalinga, Batchelor, Litchfield, the Tiwi Islands and a number of communities right across the Cobourg Peninsula. At its peak Tropical Cyclone Marcus was categorised as a category 2 system. The eye of the cyclone passed over the Darwin region, with winds in excess of 164 kilometres per hour, which caused power outages across Darwin and brought down trees, blocking roads. My latest advice is that Tropical Cyclone Marcus is now moving towards the north-west Kimberley. As you can imagine, the tropical cyclone has left behind a path of destruction in the Greater Darwin region. Hundreds—in fact, probably thousands—of trees have fallen, and many power lines have been downed. There have been widespread power outages. Power has now been restored to 11,000 customers, but 18,000 remain without power, including the majority of the schools in the Darwin area. I'm advised that around half of Darwin's traffic lights still remain out, so we urge caution on the roads. Until further notice I understand that there's some advice about boiling water, due to the damage to the water infrastructure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the Australian Department of Defence has also provided some emergency clean-up assistance immediately. On behalf of the Northern Territory and Darwin, please pass on my thanks to those Defence personnel. It's a very difficult time. I urge all Territorians to be patient and calm as authorities coordinate the clean-up effort. I encourage everyone to give each other a hand. As Senator Di Natale has indicated, it is wonderful that, in the worst of circumstances, the best of people come out. I acknowledge and thank the Northern Territory police, fire, ambulance and other emergency service personnel, as well as all the volunteers that have come out of the woodwork, for their work at this difficult time. It is such a huge relief that we've experienced no loss of life as a result of any of these disasters so far. I implore everyone to heed the advice of the authorities, and apart from that, go to the ABC. People can keep up to date with the latest advice from the Northern Territory government, Emergency Management Victoria and Emergency New South Wales websites.</span>

The reason this is relevant, Mr President, is that I'm comparing and contrasting the Labor Party under Mr Shorten with the Labor Party of old under Mr Beazley. What we can see is that Mr Shorten is all about putting his hands into the pockets of pensioners and self-funded retirees, whereas Mr Beazley understood the cost-of-living pressures that pensioners and self-funded retirees were facing. Our government has not considered such a proposal. We are not prepared to put our hands into the pockets of pensioners and self-funded retirees.

Did Treasury do any work on options to limit access to cash refunds in the lead-up to last year's budget?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the senator is, as indeed are all government senators, well aware of the risks of ad hoc policy in terms of energy—the risks of states that have chosen to go it alone in an ad hoc way and the risks, indeed, in states where they've chosen to pick ideological winners or favourites in terms of energy generation over the key issues of reliability and affordability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This, of course, has been most evident in the senator's home state—my home state as well—where we've seen the highest prices and the lowest levels of reliability. Those, of course, were the consequences of what Jay Weatherill, now the former Premier of South Australia, called his 'big experiment'—Mr Weatherill's big experiment that gave South Australia the highest prices and the least reliable energy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the election held on the weekend, on Saturday, South Australians were offered the chance to double down on Mr Weatherill's policies. They were offered more selective picking of winners, more ad hoc targets and a 75 per cent renewable energy target. That is the choice voters were given and they said, emphatically, 'No way, Jay!' No way to continued high prices; no way to continued unreliability; no way to continued ad hoc approaches to energy markets; and no way to more stunts where you find a famous billionaire to cosy up to for picture opportunities. They instead chose a commitment to make sure that we have sensible energy policy—policy built on the basis of driving down costs, improving reliability and making electricity more affordable and reliable for households and businesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The modelling undertaken for the National Energy Guarantee proposed by the Turnbull government shows that household power bills will be around $400 lower. That, of course, is of great benefit to each and every struggling Australian family, to know that in the future their household bills will be lower than would otherwise be the case and to know that the Turnbull government reforms are going to make a real difference to their cost of living.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just households. Under estimated modelling, the NEG will see a 23 per cent reduction in wholesale power prices. That means a local supermarket in South Australia, for example, could save almost half a million dollars a year; a small business or cafe could save hundreds of thousands of dollars; and an energy-intensive manufacturer could save millions of dollars. These are real benefits that allow people to employ more Australians, create more jobs and ease the cost of living. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education and Training and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:25</span>):  The removal of the South Australian Labor government absolutely clears a major threat to sensible energy policy in Australia. It removes a government that, for the sake of having a fight with Canberra, is opposed to rather than pursuing good, sensible energy policy. It removes a government that puts cheap headlines ahead of the electricity bills of South Australians. We are confident that Steven Marshall and the new Liberal government in South Australia will put good policy before those cheap headlines. In terms of threats to sensible energy policy, the question is: what will Mr Shorten and the Labor Party do? Senator Wong came out just last week and said she supported Mr Weatherill's 75 per cent renewable energy target. What is the Labor Party's renewable energy target now? Is it 40 per cent, is it 50 per cent, is it 75 per cent? What is the Labor Party's position on the National Energy Guarantee? Are they for it or are they against it? Who knows what Labor's policy is, but you can be confident Australians will pay the price for it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The discussion paper is there for all to see. It sets out the items for discussion very clearly. What I found interesting in the way the question was framed by the Leader of the Opposition, though, is that she referred to revenue implications, because the key point that we've been making is that this is a tax grab, this is a revenue measure, whereas the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, and the shadow Treasurer have been talking about this as if it were an item of expenditure. It is not an item of expenditure. What the Labor Party is proposing to do is to increase tax—to increase the tax on more than one million retirees, including, and in particular, pensioners with direct investment of some of their savings in shares and self-funded retirees who have some direct investments in shares. Whatever way in which Senator Wong and the Labor Party are trying to spin this, this is Labor changing their long-standing bipartisan support for an arrangement, a deliberate design feature of our tax system, that is entirely appropriate—that is, that low income earners should be able to take advantage of the same tax deductibility arrangements as high income earners. Bill Shorten uses the rhetoric of targeting the big end of town, of targeting rich people, for political purposes. He bamboozles people with technical language, when all along he's actually targeting low and middle income earners. Ninety-seven per cent of Australians who use this particular methodology have income of less than $87,000 a year. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I could, after having said that, legitimately sit down, but let me indicate that Australia operates a global and non-discriminatory humanitarian program. The government is committed to a responsive and targeted humanitarian program, which assists people in greatest humanitarian need of resettlement. Decisions in relation to the composition of the humanitarian program are made by the minister and take into account a range of factors, including global resettlement needs and the views of the community. The program now sits, as colleagues would be aware, at 16,250 and will move to 18,750 next program year.</span>

This will bring Australia's assistance in other affected communities, in Myanmar and Bangladesh, to over $50 million since 2012. Going to the other part of Senator McKim's—</span>

Senator O'Sullivan is correct; there have been some recent announcements that will help create jobs in Queensland, particularly connected to the resources sector. Last week I joined my ministerial colleague Minister McVeigh and the member for Dawson, Mr Christensen, in announcing the investments we are making under the Bowen Basin jobs investment package.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, as a legacy of the mining boom, a vibrant small business sector which supports the mining sector. Many of these businesses geared up significantly during the mining boom. And while many of them have faced a tough couple of years having to lay off people to survive, they are ready, they are vibrant and they are going to be successful businesses in the future, and that's why we're happy to back them for their next growth phase. We have announced investments for these businesses that will help them diversify.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">HMG Hardchrome, which operate in Paget in Mackay—I was there last week—are getting a $1.6 million grant for a $10.4 million program to deliver a world-class industrial hardchrome finishing facility. Mr Warren Smith, the Managing Director of HMG Hardchrome, said, 'We mainly service the Bowen Basin, but this will expand it and we will be looking at PNG. This diversification builds up a bigger marketplace for us and there will be more gearbox refurbishments happening.' Warren said to us that he would be putting on 10 people thanks to this investment from the coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other businesses like Diacon Australia already develop innovative technologies for the mining sector, particularly plastic and lightweight mesh safety gear. We are providing them with a $420,000 grant to improve their facilities as well. They say that will help them put on 20 jobs at Daicon as well. All of these investments are going to mean more jobs for the resources sector and a more vibrant small business community, which is great news for Mackay and the surrounding regions.</span>

There is clearly a need to diversify the economy of these regions as well, and that's why we're also investing in other industries to create jobs, including through a $5 million investment to build a new beef processing facility near Moranbah. That project will create 70 permanent jobs in a small country town and also provide an alternative outlet for our beef sector to have their products processed closer to where they are grown.</span>

Minister, can you confirm that it remains government policy to make pensioners who were born overseas wait longer to get the age pension by increasing the residential requirements from 10 to 15 years, to increase the pension age to 70, to axe the energy supplement to two million Australians, including around 400,000 age pensioners, and to take away the pension supplement from pensioners who go overseas for more than six weeks, which will see around $120 million ripped from the pockets of pensioners?</span>

Now, the Turnbull government is committed to ensuring that Australia's welfare system is well targeted to support Australians in need. The 2017-18 budget reinforces the residency based nature of Australia's pension system by increasing the resident requirement to qualify the age pension and disability support pension. Currently, to qualify for the Australian age pension or DSP, a person must be an Australian resident for a total of 10 years, with at least five of those years being continuous at any age. There is no requirement for the 10 years to be during a person's working lifetime—16 years of age to age-pension age. From 1 July 2018, to qualify for age pension or DSP, a person will be required to have 10 years continuous—</span>

Don't come in here with a holier-than-thou attitude when your leader has been out there attacking pensioners for the last week. It's their money, and you're going out there and taking it away from them. But then, of course, you have absolutely no respect whatsoever for people who have worked hard in this country to save for their retirement. Lots of self-funded retirees have worked very, very hard, and now you are coming along and you are going to take away that money from them. Don't come in here and accuse us of having a go at pensioners, because you are the biggest enemy to the pensioners of Australia.</span>

This is a very significant investment by the Australian government in Army capability, a significant advance in defence capability that will change the way that Army fights. Last week, with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence Industry, I announced that Rheinmetall will deliver 211 new Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles, which will be built in Queensland, creating up to 1,450 jobs right across Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a world of continually advancing and emerging threats. Anti-armour weapons and improvised explosive devices are becoming more lethal and more prolific. To survive in what are very hazardous operational environments, the new generation Australian armoured vehicles have to do several very important things: they have to be able to take a heavy hit, they have to be able to keep fighting and they have to be able to take our soldiers home safely. That's what this new vehicle will deliver. The cutting-edge capability of the Boxer will give Australian troops increased protection, increased firepower and increased mobility on the battlefield over the ageing ASLAV, which it will replace. They're not only much tougher than their predecessors but also much smarter. They will have digital-warfare and information-networking capabilities that our forces have not had before. They'll give our commanders a much better understanding of the battlefield, which will help them to fight, to survive and to win.</span>

What we have seen, Mr President, is that our current reconnaissance vehicle, the ASLAV, has provided sterling assistance and service to the ADF, both overseas and at home, for more than 20 years. But it is time for it to be replaced. So, over the last three years, we've undertaken an assessment of the options for the next CRV. We put the short-listed vehicles through a rigorous testing program in a range of environments across Australia, and a range of conditions, to test their suitability to Australia's requirements. They were tested with Australia's existing capability, including the Globemaster—the C-17—and our LHD vessels, to ensure interoperability there. They were subject to blast and ballistic testing to assess their survivability from a range of potential threats. In the final analysis, based on capability, the Boxer was assessed as the clear choice, and that is why the government has chosen the Boxer for the ADF.</span>

We have already ordered over 1,100 Hawkei protected mobility vehicles, which are currently being built by Thales Australia in Bendigo, creating up to 400 jobs around the country; and we are also investing more than $1.4 billion to upgrade Army's battlefield command system, which will create over 120 roles in Brisbane—to cite just a couple of examples. Combined with our historic decisions to create a continuous naval shipbuilding industry, delivering these important capabilities for Defence will be a national enterprise and enable business across the country to invest, create jobs and deliver the capability that the ADF needs.</span>

These services are vital to enabling women and girls to stay healthy, to remain in education and to participate equally in society and the economy. I would note that we support, through the aid program, the same range of reproductive health services in developing countries as are available in Australia, subject to the laws of those countries. That includes sexual and reproductive health services; education; family planning; maternal health services; the prevention and treatment of STIs and HIV; and termination, where legal. This range of activities is consistent with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Planning and the Aid Program: Guiding Principles</span> document which, you would be aware, was released in 2009. The SPRINT program—the sexual and reproductive health services in crisis and post-crisis situations phase 3 program—has been funded by Australian governments for over a decade. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We announced further funding for SPRINT 3 in February 2017, and that position continues.</span>

These new rules, as you would know, Mr President, will significantly enhance the existing restrictions on gambling advertising, with a particular focus on live sport in children's hours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Australian Communications and Media Authority registered the three revised broadcasting codes of practice to give effect to the new rules on free-to-air television, subscription TV and commercial radio. These new restrictions were announced last year as part of our comprehensive and holistic media reform package, and the government asked broadcasters to implement them voluntarily through amendments to their codes of practice. Revised codes were released for public consultation late last year, and ACMA has worked closely with the broadcasting peak bodies to achieve registration of codes in time for commencement at the end of this month. I do want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank Free TV Australia, Commercial Radio Australia and the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association for working constructively with ACMA to draft and implement these new rules. SBS, for their part, will implement their own code to implement the restrictions and have advised the government that they will observe the new rules from 30 March. </span>

No advertising will be permitted during these hours from five minutes before the start of play until five minutes after play has concluded. For example, if you're sitting down to watch Carlton versus the Gold Coast Suns—which isn't something I would personally do, Mr President—with the first bounce due at 1.45 pm on Saturday, 31 March, you will know that there will be absolutely no gambling advertising broadcast from 1.40 pm until five minutes after the match has concluded.</span>

But we're also keen to futureproof the system for a world in which online services with live sport content not covered by broadcasting codes become more prevalent. We have legislation before the Senate currently to enable ACMA to make rules to apply the same or similar restrictions to online platforms as soon as practicable. Whilst online live streams of sport today typically are simulcast from a commercial broadcaster, applying rules to online service providers will futureproof the system to ensure that gambling advertising safeguards are in place across all platforms.</span>

For those people listening to this session today, there need to be a number of facts put on the table, because one would be forgiven for thinking that the sky was going to fall in relation to Labor's changes to the dividend imputation. It is clear that nothing could be further from the truth. Under Labor's plan, no-one will pay a single cent more in tax, no-one will lose a single cent from their super contributions, no-one will lose a single cent from their pension and no-one will lose a single cent from their share dividends. It's also important to note, for those listening, that none of the changes that Labor is proposing are retrospective. If Labor were elected, they would apply from 1 July 2019 under the announced policy.</span>

That is just straight out misleading for Australians and causes unnecessary concern out there in the general public. That's what happens when we have Labor putting out principled positions on tax reform, sensible reform that is absolutely necessary. We have a provision in the tax system here that is unaffordable in the longer term. The government know that. They've done work in relation to this issue, but they won't come clean on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know why dividend imputation was brought into existence. It was a Hawke-Keating era measure, but it was Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello who made the changes to the system that have made it unaffordable. Even former Liberal leader John Hewson has talked about the fact that the tax refund aspect doesn't make any sense. We've heard credible commentators making the point that there is a need for change. We've seen a representative from KPMG making a similar comment. We've seen Saul Eslake coming out and talking about the commonsense aspect of this proposal. We know that what we are talking about is well-considered, and it is supported by a number of credible economic commentators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were to listen to those opposite you would think that they were the party defending pensioners. Once again for the benefit of those listening to this broadcast, one just needs to put into context this famed indignation and objection of those opposite to Labor's responsible changes. What have they tried to do? They tried to cut pension indexation, a change that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within 10 years. They cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions, meaning pensioners in some states are paying more for things like rates and vehicle registration. I know that pensioners in Queensland are grateful for the work of the Labor government in stepping up to the plate and mitigating the impact of that cut. We've seen their changes to the assets test, which saw nearly 100,000 pensioners kicked off the pension entirely and cut the pension for more than a quarter of a million pensioners. We know the government are increasing the age pension eligibility age to 70—the oldest of comparable countries. This will deny the age pension for 375,000 older Australians over the first four years alone. This is a $3.6 billion hit to the retirement income of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners are facing higher power bills and greater out-of-pocket health costs, and yet here we have the government pretending that they are concerned about the impact of this change on pensioners. They are conducting a good old-fashioned scare campaign. The foreign minister made some comments yesterday on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>; we've seen the Treasurer coming out with hysterical claims about the impact of these changes—in fact, he's misleading people by saying that many of those who will be impacted are on low taxable incomes. Of course low taxable income means that people can still receive quite a lot in superannuation. This is a responsible reform and needs to be supported.</span>

Jealousy and envy motivates Labor's policy settings these days, and that undermines the virtues on which our nation's success was built. Indeed, as Australia's great Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies opined in his Forgotten People speech:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wasn't he so right? And what he has shown is exactly what the Australian Labor Party are seeking to descend Australian society into.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact is that there are many hundreds of thousands of men and women right around Australia that have scrimped and saved to ensure that they are self-reliant in retirement. And what are the Labor Party seeking to do? Deny them the benefits and the rewards of that thrift and that self-reliance. We, in the coalition, want to build this nation by encouraging the virtues of thrift, savings and self-reliance, but Labor today seeks to tear down those virtues with scant regard for the actual consequences.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ketter suggested that the Labor policy on tax credits in relation to the shareholdings of pensioners and superannuants was responsible and well considered, and that the facts were on the table. Let me put one fact on the table. I wonder who said this: 'We will now complete the implementation of the imputation system by allowing excess credits to be funded to resident Australian shareholders, complying superannuation funds and registered charitable organisations.' Further on, it continues: 'Many thousands of pensioners who have modest investments in public companies currently obtain no tax benefit from the franked dividends they receive. The full value of these credits will now flow through to the pensioner shareholders.' That was the Australian Labor Party policy, in a bipartisan way, only 20 years ago. Men and women around Australia, on that basis—</span>

                  </a>  The current Labor leadership in the Senate seeks to scoff at that, but people in their 40s and 50s, relying on that promise, scrimped and saved and organised their retirement income and lifestyle on the basis of that promise, only to have this current Labor leadership, which is motivated by jealousy and envy and class warfare, rip this rug out from underneath them. Those retirees, on the promises made by the Labor Party 20 years ago, ordered their retirement funds and income accordingly. The Labor Party in this place will scoff, but the simple fact is that, unless we as a community and a society are willing to support and salute those who are willing to help themselves, the burden becomes much greater on everybody else. That is why Robert Menzies was so right when he said: if you don't provide encouragement and if you instead say to people, 'If you save, if you set money aside and if you invest in Australian companies in the hope of receiving a retirement income, the government will snatch it away from you,' why would they bother investing in Australian companies? Why would you bother looking after yourself in retirement? You can just rely on all your fellow Australian taxpayers. You know what happens? You can have the tax grab today, but that is like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. You will get the extra golden egg for one day, but the cost will be quite substantial in the years to come. That is why Labor's policy is so divisive and so short-sighted and needs to be rejected. </span>

We have as our Prime Minister a man who was so interested in and committed to economic reform that he put forward his own taxation policies and paid himself to have them costed during the Howard government. This is a man who toppled former Prime Minister Abbott because he felt that only he could provide the economic leadership that we need. Those were his words. Yet, having fulfilled his ambitions, having achieved the power to actually do things, he instead chooses to do nothing. I think many Australians find this genuinely disappointing. Many Australians are confused about where <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A </span>Malcolm has disappeared to. I'm not sure myself. It's possible that the Prime Minister is held back by internal division.</span>

                  </a>  I certainly will. It is hard, you have to observe, to move forward if you're always looking back over your shoulder at who's sitting behind you. I think it's the case that the only policies that he can put forward are the ones that no-one—absolutely no-one—in his party room can possibly disagree with, and we know that the only thing that really unites the coalition party room is attacking unions, attacking the representatives of working people. Or perhaps his ministers think that the purpose of government is to deliver for the rent seekers who show up for the meetings rather than for ordinary Australians. But it doesn't matter what the reason is; the result is the same: the government has no economic vision for Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should be embarrassed that it has left policies like our reform on dividend imputation sitting in the desk drawer. Treasury and experts have been calling for this reform for years. In 2009, the NAB chairman and former Treasury secretary Ken Henry called for reform as part of his review of the tax system. It has become clear that Treasury considered dividend imputation reform in the lead-up to Treasurer Scott Morrison's last budget, creating a dossier entitled 'Tax policy: dividend imputation'. A white paper on tax reform commissioned by Treasurer Hockey in 2015 found there were some revenue concerns with the refundability of imputation credits. And it's clear what they meant: the department was receiving lower tax revenues than it expected. The department said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… it provides a greater incentive for shareholders of closely held companies to delay distributions until a time when individual owners are subject to a relatively low tax rate, to receive a refund of tax paid by the company.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have received the advice. They know this is a good idea—they've considered it in the past—but they lack the courage or the will to follow through. Their only plan is to deliver corporate tax cuts for their donors, and, in the meantime, while they thrash around on the hook of a rational policy that would restore the budget and provide $11 billion extra in budget repair over the next four years, they cry crocodile tears for low-income earners in their retirement years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'll ask you this: where was the concern when the government was busily trying to cut the rate at which the pension was indexed? Where was the concern of those coalition frontbenchers who've been so eager to climb all over the idea of people who've been disadvantaged by this policy? Where was their concern when they did a deal with the Greens political party to kick a whole lot of people off the pension by changing the asset test? Where's the concern even today, when it's clear from the remarks made by Senator Fierravanti-Wells that those on the pension are in fact a burden on the Australian taxpayer? Where is the concern in the remarks made by Senator Abetz that the virtues we look for are thrift, savings and self-reliance? I've got some news for Senator Abetz: you can work hard all your life and exhibit the virtues of self-reliance and of thrift and you still won't have a very large superannuation balance at the end of it—and that is the experience of the majority of Australian women.</span>

Labor's policy is fair. It is a fair way to pursue budget repair, and it's a policy that ought to have been adopted by the coalition.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  It was interesting listening to the commencement of Senator McAllister's presentation, because it was almost as if the only thing she didn't want to talk about was Labor's policy. Labor talk about fairness, and you hear them talk about fairness a lot. Senator Ketter also talked about what Labor's policy wouldn't do, including that it wouldn't take the pension and wouldn't take dividends. But what Labor's policy is doing is taking away pensioners' and self-funded retirees' and part-pensioners' income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These returns form an important part of their income. When you consider that more than half of the individuals receiving these refunded franking credits have taxable incomes of less than $18,200—more than half—and 86 per cent have incomes less than $37,000 and the discussion amongst members of the Labor Party is that perhaps the revenue from this measure, or the saving from this measure, could be put towards a tax cut, how fair is it that that tax cut is off the reduction in the direct income, the direct available funds, of people earning less than $37,000 or $18,200? With 86 per cent of these individuals having incomes less than $37,000, how fair is it that the rest of the community gets a tax deduction on the back of this measure? How fair is that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How fair is it that a constituent who was in touch with me last week, with a total income of $23,000 including these franking credits, is going to lose $5,000 of that income? How fair is that? That is the on-the-ground, practical effect of what's going to happen. Now, this couple don't have a huge, multimillion-dollar retirement fund. They have a couple of hundred thousand dollars worth of shares, and that's what they live on. That is what they live on. This measure is going to directly reduce their current available funds to live on, $23,000, by about $5,000. How fair is it that that then goes into a tax deduction for someone who could be a millionaire or someone on $300,000? How fair is that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is such a good policy, as Labor is claiming, why is it that Labor backbenchers are building dossiers to bring to Canberra to put before caucus to tell what a devastating effect this policy is going to have on their constituents, particularly in regional communities? A farmer sells their farm. After 20, 30 or 40 years on the farm, they've got $300,000 or $400,000. They put it into Australian shares. Three hundred thousand dollars at seven per cent is going to earn them about $20,000 a year. If they get tax credits on all of those, that's probably another $5,000 or $6,000. That's how much you're reducing their income. It's not hard to work this stuff out if you really think about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it that the Labor Party have got about people who have worked hard, have bought some shares, probably cumulatively over a long period of time, and are now fully dependent on the income from those shares for their daily living expenses? The Labor Party want to rip out, in some cases, 20-odd per cent of their income directly—just take it away. And then they'll go out and brag that they can give that away as a tax cut to the rest of the community. How fair is that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the Labor Party's so-called fairness nerve when it comes to this measure? Most of the impact is on people on low incomes, not the high-flyers that the Leader of the Opposition likes to portray it as. Most of the impact of this measure is on people on low incomes. You are taking away their living expenses. That is exactly what's happening. They're ringing our offices just the way that they're ringing Labor backbenchers' offices, because their income is being drastically reduced, and it's going to affect their way of living. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247512" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  Despite the government's rhetoric and their self-aggrandising talk of being good economic managers, they are not. They are poor economic managers. Let's look at the federal debt level as an example. They have more than doubled federal debt since they came into government in 2013. Federal debt is now about $600 billion. It's a toxic debt crater that will smoulder for generations to come. It's all rhetoric all of the time from those across the chamber, but their substance is rip-offs and the distortion of our tax system and—even worse than that—being too weak to desire, let alone make, any changes or make any reforms. They say they don't like deficits yet spend like drunken fiscal sailors. They are a government suffering from the ill-effects of having two weak treasurers, firstly Joe Hockey, the former member for North Sydney, and now the member for Cook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Labor Party that reformed the tax system. The Labor Party got rid of the double-taxation that occurred on the ownership of shares. In 1987, the then Labor government of Prime Minister Hawke and Treasurer Keating introduced imputation credits. When the federal budget was in surplus under former Prime Minister John Howard and former Treasurer Peter Costello—oh, those heady days; how the current members of the ERC must dream about having a surplus—it was they who introduced the scheme allowing people who were not paying any income tax to get cash back under the imputation credits scheme. The cash refunds actually avoid paying single-taxation on dividends. So, it went from double-taxation to single-taxation and, with the method that is in place now, if you are not paying income tax you receive the cash-back and you don't pay any tax at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My favourite definition of this scheme is from the member for Fenner, who calls it 'the cane toad of the taxation system'. That is because it cost around $500 million when it was first introduced, but soon it will cost around $8 billion. We heard Senator Cormann say that Treasury advice has been given on this. There have been discussion papers aplenty. Why? I bet Treasury is telling the government, telling the members of the ERC, that these cash-back payments are no longer affordable for our economy. We are the only country with a full refundable imputation system—and that is from the tax centre at KPMG.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the government doing? Well, they are weak. They are never going to make any big changes, because they know they are essentially an unstable government. They know they are tick-tocking closer to 30 Newspolls and they know there are murmurings and mumblings from all quarters of the government, so the question that is most pressing for some of those opposite is: should the Prime Minister be taken out in a one-stage or a two-stage process, and should that be done before the mid-year break?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows the resources accumulated by the state are and should be limited. They know this because it has been the Labor Party that has been the economic reformer in this country. This is because we are willing and we are able to make hard decisions. In a word, we are able and we are willing to govern. It was the ALP that made the hard decision to means test the age pension. No-one wanted to do that. The coalition opposed it, but imagine the state of the federal budget if that hard and difficult decision had not been made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Abetz says that this policy is motivated by envy. It is not motivated by that at all. It is motivated by knowing that the budget cannot be all things to all people and that hard choices must be made. It is not a divisive policy. It was announced before the Batman by-election. Imagine the hue and cry from those opposite if it had been announced this week: 'Oh, how cynical! You're doing it after the by-election!' Well, it was announced before the by-election. It was given full transparency and the people in Batman voted in Labor. The ability and capacity to make society fair and equitable is perhaps something only the ALP is able to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKim today relating to comments made by the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Dutton).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked Senator Fifield about Minister Dutton's comments in regard to white South African farmers, when he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I do think, on the information that I've seen, people do need help and they need help from a civilised country like ours …</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also made it very clear that in fact he had asked his department to give special attention to how the Australian government may help white South African farmers who he believes are being persecuted to get special attention in terms of visas and humanitarian entry to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those comments from Minister Dutton showed what a shocking hold <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> and News Corp more generally have over the Liberal Party in Australia. And make no mistake: the Liberal Party in Australia is now liberal in name only. Any sense of moderation, any strain of actual liberalism has long been extinguished from the coalition. Last week was yet another piece of evidence of the Liberal Party's lurch towards white nationalism. With talking points taken directly from white supremacist websites, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> last week launched a campaign in defence of white South African farmers. And, without a moment's hesitation, Home Affairs Minister Dutton jumped into the fray, saying that these white farmers needed rescuing by a 'civilised country' like Australia. Now, in using those words, Minister Dutton is not dog-whistling to racists; he is actually foghorning to racists. There's nothing subtle about this racism and this white nationalism, and it is becoming more and more blatant in the Australian Liberal Party every day that passes during which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull does not rebuke and pull his home affairs minister into line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, this is the same home affairs minister who is inflicting untold misery on thousands of refugees and people seeking asylum, who remain to this day Australia's political prisoners on Manus Island and Nauru. It is the same home affairs minister who's turned a blind eye to the ethnic cleansing that is occurring against the Rohingya people at the hands of the Myanmar government. And those aren't my words; they're actually the words of the United Nations—'textbook example of ethnic cleansing'. But no: we'll ignore the plight of the Rohingya people—hundreds of thousands of them displaced, killed and brutalised in what I regard as an attempt at genocide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he's now going to turn around and try to lend a hand to a new group of people he wants to see coming into Australia, the white South African farmers. Remember, as Leader of the Liberal Party in the 1980s, John Howard opposed sanctions against apartheid South Africa. And make no mistake: the yearning for apartheid and the White Australia policy still exists inside the Liberal Party in Australia today, and in the age of Donald Trump they are getting less and less coy about expressing it. They're adopting an approach to South Africa that's been lifted from Neo-Nazis and white supremacists and printed in the pages of the Murdoch papers in this country. They've tried and are still trying to introduce university-level English tests before people can come to Australia, before they can become Australian—a hallmark of the White Australia policy. They are engaging in a racist campaign against Victoria's African communities and are now seeking the right to deport non-white children. Senator Molan, before he started in this place, was sharing the videos of a British hate group on his Facebook page, an action he is yet to apologise for. And you've got the member for Dawson, Mr Christensen, speaking at white supremacist rallies and appearing on Neo-Nazi podcasts. Well, I say today, to these people and to the Liberal Party: they will fail and you and your apartheid cronies will fail again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The coalition government is acting to ensure Australia's fiscal sustainability by maintaining our path back to budget balance in 2021 and tackling rising debt. Everything this government is delivering is designed to reduce the burden on families and guarantee essential services. That's why we're committed to keeping taxes as low as they possibly can be. Reducing the corporate tax rate would make a strong contribution to Australia's economic growth and raise productivity, employment and wages in Australia. A lower company tax rate would result in higher earnings and more investment. This will lead to longer term capital gains and higher dividends in the future for domestic shareholders of Australian companies including retirees. Our comprehensive plan to boost investment in Australia also includes a defence industry plan, a national energy guarantee, $75 billion in infrastructure investment and record investments in skills and education.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 38th AIPA General Assembly was held last year in Manila, Philippines. As a member of the Australian observer delegation, it was an honour to attend this important forum of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year was a significant year—2017 was the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and it was also the 40th anniversary of the creation of the parliamentary arm of ASEAN: the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly. As was noted during the first plenary session, the common goal of establishing an ASEAN community by 2025 will require stronger coordination between governments and legislatures. In this context, the General Assembly focused on how AIPA and ASEAN can work together to bring about inclusive change to the communities in the region. The assembly also dealt with important regional concerns, including humanitarian situations in parts of the region; combating illegal drugs, terrorism and trafficking; and enhancing cooperation in the use of science and technology for peaceful purposes. As with previous general assemblies, maritime disputes were also raised, and parties were urged to work towards a peaceful resolution in accordance with international law. All countries reinforced AIPA's important contributions to maintaining peace and stability in the region, promoting cultural exchange and understanding, enhancing cooperation on transnational matters and improving prosperity in the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key meetings for the delegation was a formal dialogue session with representatives of ASEAN member countries. The dialogue session was an important opportunity to discuss cooperation and engagement between our parliaments. The warm discussions with our regional colleagues centred on strengthening cooperation in the areas of disaster management and combating transnational crimes—in particular, terrorism, violent extremism and trafficking in persons. Our parliamentary colleagues in the region were particularly interested in the work being done by our parliament to establish a modern slavery act in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most common messages during the dialogue session was the extent to which our regional partners value our friendship and cooperation. The dialogue session gave our delegation the opportunity to renew ties with our parliamentary colleagues overseas and to reinforce Australia's commitment to the South-East Asia region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to representing Australia at the AIPA General Assembly, the delegation also attended appointments to reaffirm our ties with the Philippines parliament. The delegation was pleased to meet with several of our parliamentary colleagues and appreciated the opportunity to discuss defence cooperation between our two countries; the situation in Marawi; and shared concerns, such as transportation and economic development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a meaningful and longstanding relationship with our neighbours. We have had a multilateral relationship with ASEAN since 1974, and our ongoing presence at AIPA general assemblies reinforces Australia's ongoing commitment to engaging with South-East Asia. Our commitment to attending AIPA general assemblies is an important opportunity to demonstrate Australia's support for ASEAN and one that I would support continuing into the future. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to record our thanks to the host of the 38th General Assembly, the parliament of the Philippines, for its excellent hospitality and a very well run general assembly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Australian Embassy in Manila in assisting with arrangements for the delegation's meetings at the Philippine parliament, which enhanced the visit's overall success. I would also urge the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to give their full assistance to future parliamentary delegations to the AIPA General Assembly. It is imperative that parliamentarians are properly briefed on the broader foreign relations context and considerations in order to maximise this important opportunity for Australia in the South-East Asian region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to acknowledge my colleague on the delegation, Mr George Christensen MP, whose leadership, cooperation and keen interest in the Philippines made a valuable contribution to the visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always we were resourced by excellent work from the parliamentary secretariat. That is always worth noting. It is always of an exceptionally high standard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me great pleasure to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 26th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, held in Vietnam from 18 to 21 January this year. I had the honour of leading the delegation, which included the members for Perth, Whitlam and Wright from the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum is an assembly of members of national parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region which has met each year since 1993 to discuss matters of mutual concern. Issues the APPF deals with are mainly strategic, economic, social and cultural in nature. The APPF is important to the Australian parliament as the parliamentary association of members who share Australia's region. Key regional countries with which Australia has strong links send delegations to the APPF annual meetings. Such countries include Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, a number of Pacific island countries and our host, Vietnam. Each conference is structured around a number of plenary sessions, working groups and a drafting committee that considers a range of resolutions arising from the discussions. Participating countries submit draft resolutions that form the basis of the discussion of sessions and subsequent conference resolutions finalised through consensus. The sessions are under the themes of political and security matters, economic and trade matters and regional cooperation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The four draft resolutions forwarded by the Australian delegation reflect the interests of the delegation members. I took carriage of a resolution on food security in the Asia-Pacific region. I met a number of officials from the Vietnamese department of agriculture. The member for Wright spoke on combatting international terrorism and transporter crime and also chaired a working group debating regional security matters. The member for Whitlam spoke on the importance of fostering regional tourism cooperation and also chaired a working group on economic cooperation in the region. The member for Perth continued the long tradition of advocacy by Australian delegations to the APPF for giving female parliamentarians a greater say in APPF deliberations and in the region generally. I'm pleased to report that the APPF unanimously passed a resolution establishing a meeting of female parliamentarians as a standing item of future APPF meetings. The Australian delegation was small in comparison to the numbers in some national delegations. This meant we had a busy schedule, contributing to as many of the sessions as possible. The forum provided an excellent opportunity for us to forge links with our parliamentary colleagues in the region and to discuss issues of common concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for assistance with briefing papers for the forum meetings and for the support provided in Vietnam by the Australian ambassador and his colleagues. The Parliamentary Library also provided briefing material which the delegation found very useful. Of course, we must also thank our very hospitable hosts, the National Assembly of Vietnam. Our thanks go, in particular, to the President of the National Assembly, Mrs Nguyen Ngan, and her staff. Our hosts were exceptionally generous in their welcome and hospitality. It was obvious that a tremendous effort had been made to ensure the event was a success. Special mention should also be made of the support staff and student volunteers, who were unfailingly helpful and enthusiastic and who helped make the forum successful. A special thankyou to Mr James Catchpole, the Serjeant-at-Arms in the other place. Mr Catchpole was brilliant with his communication and his organisation, and his friendship was enjoyed by all who attended. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  It is opportune that this is the matter that we are discussing today, in light of the events of the weekend and, particularly, the Batman by-election. I want to put on the record my congratulations to Ged Kearney, the new Labor member for Batman, and the federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who really threw himself into the campaign. There has been a real consistency about what Labor have been talking about since Bill Shorten became the Labor leader, and I think that bore fruit in the Batman by-election. When you look at the issues in this matter of public importance, they are issues on which Labor has been campaigning strongly and has put significant positions on the public record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a real contrast between what Labor took to the Batman by-election and what we saw from the Greens. The repercussions have already started on the Greens side. We have seen Senator Di Natale having to deal with them over the last 48 hours. But, if the Greens had learnt anything out of the Batman by-election, in the Senate chamber today they would have withdrawn that stunt of a bill that they had, the Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017. If they'd really learnt the lessons from what happened on Saturday in the Batman by-election, they would have pulled that stunt of a bill—because that's all it was, an absolute stunt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast the stunts that the Greens have been pursuing around important issues with the behaviour of someone like Ged Kearney, who has a history of standing up for people, standing up for organisations and fighting for things for matter. She is a person of substance, a woman of substance, not someone who is going to fall for stunts or the latest tricks but someone who's been standing up and advocating for workers, advocating for social services, for decades. This was the contrast in Batman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in the Senate today the Greens came in and pursued, as always, a stunt—something that was going to have no consequence but something that the Greens were happy to pursue because they have learnt nothing out of what happened on Saturday. We have seen this time and time again, where basically they seek purely political advantage out of substantial issues. Nothing for them can be boiled down unless they can seek some political advantage out of it. Then they are happy to pursue it. We absolutely are going to hold them to account for that. They've learnt nothing out of the Batman by-election, and they showed again in the Senate today that they have learnt nothing in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the current-day Greens are nothing, not even a patch, on the Bob Brown Greens from a decade ago. They are leaderless, they are visionless, they are divided and they have basically become inconsequential. Once upon a time, the people around Australia would listen to Bob Brown; they'd at least hear what he had to say. But, when it comes to Senator Di Natale, no-one hears what his contribution is. No-one wants to hear what his contribution is, because it's inconsequential. It's full of stunts. There's no substance behind it, and what we saw on Saturday, and what we've seen in other elections around the country in recent times, is that the Australian people are waking up to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not a patch on the Bob Brown Greens that we were used to a decade ago—people who even the other side would have to listen to. They've got more and more desperate. And the more desperate they've become, the worse they go. Unfortunately, I think that we're going to see a pattern from them where they increasingly pursue stunts and cynical politics, all to seek a little bit of political advantage for themselves—not trying to tackle some of the big challenges that this country faces but all for seeking some little political advantage. But they were held up in Batman, and full credit to the Labor campaign for doing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the issues raised in this matter of public importance, they're about addressing cost-of-living issues; tackling climate change; the undermining of wages and conditions; and ensuring that children from any postcode in Australia get a quality education. And, when it comes to these issues, the federal government have dithered, or delayed or done nothing. They really aren't listening to the concerns of the Australian people in regard to these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the cost of living, they have dithered on energy policy now for over 12 months. The uncertainty that they have caused is causing prices to rise, and still we have not seen the National Energy Guarantee go through their party room. We come in here, and Senator Birmingham likes to try to lecture us about what our position is. We've said that we're happy to work with the government on the National Energy Guarantee, but they can't even get it through their own party room. They won't even present it to get it through their party room. How can we negotiate with a party that can't even get their own caucus to agree—let alone all the states—and put a position to the opposition that we can come to an agreement on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their dithering is having a real consequence for Australian families, through higher prices, and also for Australian workers. This dithering is inconsequential for those who rely on gas as feed stock for their business, whether it be the Gibson Island fertiliser plant or the smelters in Gladstone or around the country. The government are more focused on their internal squabbles than they are on the Australian people—Australian workers or Australian families, it is no matter to them who it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to tackling climate change, they've actually achieved a rare feat. They've seen energy prices increase whilst they've also seen a rise in pollution—quite remarkable! That's what we've seen from the other side. This has been a double whammy to the Australian people but also to future generations. So we're still no closer to hearing where they stand on the National Energy Guarantee. Once again, I re-emphasise that this has not gone through their party room. Those same Neanderthals on the backbench who always want to play up around tackling this issue are causing ongoing grief that they have still not been able to resolve, and it leaves us here, who are willing to work across the aisle to resolve this issue, none the wiser about what their final policy is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next one is around undermining of wages and conditions. This has been a really significant one across Australia but also one that I've seen firsthand in Queensland, with the devastating impact that this is having. We know that the LNP supports the cuts to penalty rates. We know that they've argued against a decent increase to the minimum wage. We know that they voted against Labor's proposals to make big business liable for underpayment of workers along the supply chain and also by subcontractors. They've got their heads in the sand around the changing nature of the labour market, and they've gone missing in action completely when it comes to the discussion about the future of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is their record when it comes to wages and conditions. Is it any wonder that the workers of Australia don't trust this mob? They don't trust them when it comes to wages and conditions, and we know that the government  loves nothing more than attacking workers and attacking their representatives in the unions. And, when it comes to education, the LNP are busy selling their cuts. Those will have a negative impact on children and, I fear, particularly on those children from remote and regional areas—those who need it the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when you look at the key issues in this matter of public importance, we know that the LNP are failing them on every single one. They're failing when it comes to the issues about cost of living. We know that they're failing on the issues when it comes to tackling climate change; we've actually seen pollution go up under this government. And we know that the undermining of wages and conditions is something that is happening unabated under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They constantly attack unions and constantly attack workers. We know what they have done with penalty rates and we know what is happening in places like regional Queensland, where labour hire is rampant. The government are doing nothing to crack down on that. We've seen casualisation increasing, making it harder for people to get a loan to get into the housing market or to buy a car. This is having a devastating impact on regional towns. It's actually changing the nature of those regional towns. These towns were once very attractive places to go and live and work, but the fact that in some of these places you can only get casual employment is making them less attractive. It means that people are going to have to move away. It means that kids who are growing up who are potentially third or fourth generations living in that town are having to move away for opportunities. This is what casualisation is doing; this is the uncertainty that it is causing. We also know that the LNP have not been able to resolve their internal challenges around energy and the impact that's having.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are the only party listening when it comes to responding to these challenges. The Greens are divided. We know that there are repercussions internally that they have to deal with after what happened in Batman—but, still, they haven't changed their behaviour. We know that the LNP are not listening to these people. We know that they are not taking these issues into account in determining how they are going run their government. But Labor are listening. We are spending as much time as we can on the ground in these communities and hearing directly from them. We will continue to ensure that we represent the views of all Australians in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I was a little bit bemused by this MPI when I read it and I thought, 'Senator Collins, you're really not trying hard enough with these MPIs.' We've got a grab bag of issues here: cost-of-living pressures, climate change, undermining wages and conditions, and the importance of ensuring that children of any postcode in Australia, city or country, can get a quality education. They are all very important issues, but it is a very strange way of phrasing an MPI. I was wondering to myself, 'What could this possibly be about?' Of course, what it is really about is a chance for the Labor Party, as we've just seen from Senator Chisholm, to have a whack at the Greens—a whack at the government on the way through, of course, but a whack at the Greens. It isn't surprising at all that, after we saw the Labor Party tacking to the left and following the Greens on various issues as they chased a result in Batman, they are now attempting to tack back to the centre now the Batman by-election is out of the way. It's a pretty cynical exercise. It's an exercise that the Australian people see through pretty clearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addressing this grab bag of issues, one of the key issues on the table at the moment is the current enterprise tax plan from this government. The enterprise tax plan is coming in multiple parts and it has at its foundation the idea that keeping Australian business as strong as possible by encouraging economic growth is how we drive business growth, wages and employment growth. We grow the economy for everyone by making the economy a positive experience for as many people as possible in Australia. That's why what we're trying to deliver is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already seen the first part of that legislated in this place for businesses earning up to $50 million in turnover each year and with particular changes that assist those smaller businesses with $2 million to $10 million in turnover every year. In addition to the tax cut itself, there are things like the small business incentive and the instant asset write-off, which I know has been used extensively by small businesses to upgrade plant and equipment, to invest in new technologies for their business, to help grow their business and to employ more people. We've also seen the pooling of depreciation and GST being able to be calculated on a cash flow basis—all things that advantage these small and medium businesses, which is very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next part of the enterprise tax plan grows those tax cuts to larger businesses. The most important thing to remember in that regard is that larger businesses feed through to smaller businesses in terms of employment, growth and opportunities. You see this throughout the economy but certainly in my home state of Western Australia. I was recently at what you'd have to say is a medium-sized business, Legeneering. It's a business that employs around 200 people, is based in the electorate of Fremantle and services, largely, mining industry clients. That is a business that started just 12 years ago, in 2005, with three employees and an apprentice. As I said, today that business employs around 200 people. It's a very successful business. Who does that business contract to? Who does that business derive its business from? One of its major clients is Woodside, which, we all acknowledge, is a large business. Woodside is a company that started about 64 years ago, and that is a business that started with just one person and an idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea is that we are trying to lower tax rates so more people can grow their businesses and take their businesses from one person to two people to 20 people to 200 people to many thousands of people. Woodside currently employs about 3,000 people directly and indirectly provides opportunities to about 20,000 people. Every big business started off as a small business and it's really important to recognise that, in this space, we have to stay globally competitive if we are going to encourage and allow those small businesses to grow to medium-sized businesses and then grow to large businesses. That bastion of low taxes, France, has a corporate tax rate of 15 per cent. In Hong Kong it is 16½ per cent, in Canada it is 15 per cent, in Ireland it is 12½ per cent and in Singapore it is 17 per cent and lower for some companies. In the United Kingdom it is 19 per cent, with a plan to drop to, I believe, 17 per cent. In the US currently, at the federal level, it is 21 per cent, with a plan to drop to 15 per cent. In a world where capital is mobile—and it certainly is—and business decisions are made on a long-term horizon, for Australia not to look at its corporate tax rate would be a severe problem in the future. We need to encourage those businesses to want to invest in Australia long term and we need to keep our corporate tax rate competitive with the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this grab bag of an MPI, we also have climate change. Obviously, the National Energy Guarantee is very important in order both to address our energy security issues and to meet our international commitments. Again, this feeds directly into business profitability. The modelling that was conducted on the National Energy Guarantee by Frontier Economics shows that a medium-sized business such as a supermarket could save over $400,000 a year. This is a significant amount of money to those small and medium-sized enterprises that employ Australians. This is the key thing. I recently met with the owner of a small supermarket from South Australia whose electricity bill had gone up in one year by $100,000. How many small and medium-sized businesses can sustain an increase in their costs of $100,000 in 12 months? We need policies in place to drive down energy costs, and the National Energy Guarantee clearly will do that. We need everyone to come on board this policy. Hopefully, with a new government being elected in South Australia in recent days, we will see a much more productive conversation taking place in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to emissions, what does the National Energy Guarantee provide? It will see a 26 per cent reduction in the emissions from the National Electricity Market. This is a significant contribution to our international commitments and a significant way in which this government is both addressing the issues of energy efficiency and energy production and reliability and meeting our international commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I wondered why I came in here, and it was clearly so the Labor Party could try and tack back to the centre and have a whack at the Greens. I feel like making a contribution between the Labor Party and the Greens. I should let them go at it. But I will reflect again on why it is important that this government gets support from the crossbench for its enterprise tax plan. It is a very important economic reform. Growth is not an abstract number in the budget; growth is what will drive businesses to employ more people, for wages to be able to increase over time. Growth is what will give people the opportunities for the jobs for the next generation. It is certainly something that all people in this place should support, and I would encourage the crossbench to seriously consider that as they consider their position on the government's enterprise tax plan in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="DT6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  Senator Chisholm, from the Labor Party, spoke earlier in this matter of public importance debate. I agree that it is important—the need for policies that address cost-of-living pressures, climate change, the undermining of wages and conditions, and the importance of ensuring children from any postcode in Australia, city or country, can get a quality education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being from Queensland, Senator Chisholm would know, and he should know, the good news: he's in luck that those policies already exist, and it's the Greens that have those policies. Being from Queensland, he would have seen up close how strongly the Greens promoted policies targeting exactly these issues in his own state, getting results from the electorate as a consequence of that. This from the Labor Party, who have presided over massive increases in electricity costs in Queensland because of their adherence to the neoliberal ideology that has meant that they pursued that approach of privatisation and corporatisation of public entities that were previously there to deliver for the interests of community rather than for corporations and for profit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Chisholm was talking about climate change and the need for policies on climate change on the very day that the Labor Party voted once again to adopt a new subsidy to explore for thermal coal. Perhaps Senator Chisholm and the Labor Party could look in the direction of the Greens and see the policies that already exist if they wanted to ensure that there is action on cost-of-living pressures, on climate change and on the undermining of wages and conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the Greens that have led the way unequivocally in being the first out to oppose cuts with regard to penalty rates, to promote the importance of increasing the minimum wage substantially and to push up substantially an increase in Newstart and pensions—one way to address cost-of-living pressures and ensure that those people that are being paid the least, that have the lowest incomes, have their income increased. The Greens policies are to address housing affordability by investing in building more houses that are affordable for people, by ensuring that electricity is affordable, by ensuring all energy networks and generation corporations are changed back to being efficient public authorities and by ensuring that public transport is significantly cheaper and reliable. We are getting the opposite with the state Labor government in Queensland—and I'm sure in many other states around Australia—which is putting up public transport fares, and, certainly in the south-east, the rail system is becoming an embarrassment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have this problem with cost-of-living pressures because, under the ideology of neoliberalism, of free market fundamentalism, we have seen the steady march of privatisation of our essential services like energy, housing, hospitals and education. Neoliberalism, this free market fundamentalism, is an ideology that ruins communities and lives and it's an ideology that both the old parties of the political establishment are still wedded to. They both sold off essential services that provided for basic human rights and basic human needs so that they could be run for profit. They both continue to support an approach where corporate profits are put ahead of community needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With climate change, it is important and pleasing to see the ALP are acknowledging the need for more action, but what we need is not just an acknowledgment of better action; we need an adoption of effective policies. Let me remind the Senate about the fact that it was the Greens in this parliament who pushed and—no-one can deny—were pivotal in delivering what many independent observations say is the world's best practice in regard to a carbon reduction mechanism that also ensured that people weren't hurt by increased cost-of-living impacts. It was shown to be effective in the very short period of time before it was disgracefully dismantled—vandalised by the coalition. It delivered a reduction in emissions—emissions that are now going back up again under this government at a time when energy prices are also going up further under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just a matter of protecting our environment and protecting the future of our planet—fundamental as those things are. It is about the impact on people's lives right now. The failure to act on climate change is putting people's lives at risk and is also contributing to those cost-of-living pressures. In my own state of Queensland, in Far North Queensland, which I've already spoken about in this chamber, people, individuals and businesses have faced over the last five to ten years massive increases in their insurance premiums specifically linked to increased severity of weather events. It's having a direct cost impact on the community in Far North Queensland right now. The people of the Torres Strait Islands are having their homes and islands made uninhabitable by rising sea levels, increased severe weather events and higher storm surges. Hopefully, all of us here will be aware of the major damage wreaked in the Torres Strait Islands just a couple of months ago for this reason. Entire island communities and cultures are at risk of being wiped out due to climate change right here in the Australian community, in the Queensland community, within decades. Yet we get nothing, in terms of any meaningful action, from this government. In fact, we're getting action that makes things worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People's lives are being put at risk. The future of their communities is being put at risk. They are facing cost-of-living impacts right now because our politicians, in league with massive fossil fuel corporations, are putting profits and corporate donations ahead of human lives. Just as does tobacco, we know fossil fuels put lives at risk. But here in Australia the two parties of the political establishment are in the pockets of the big fossil fuel corporations, so they continue to not act or to not act adequately to address what needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we're talking about wages and conditions, let's not forget that wages are not just flatlining but, for many people, particularly those on lower incomes, going backwards. They're not keeping up with the cost of living, yet corporate profits are at record highs. And let's not forget that this is under Labor's so-called Fair Work Act. The Your Rights at Work campaign in 2007—and I was in this parliament at the time—showed just how much ordinary Australians care about their working conditions and how they will get behind an imaginative and progressive union campaign and a community movement that is focused on people's direct needs and direct experiences. But it's also a lesson in how grassroots movements can be betrayed by politicians, given that when Labor got into government they introduced this unfair work act, which has failed to deliver on the promise of the campaign, so much so that the union movement is now launching another major campaign to get our industrial relations laws to work to fix Labor's Fair Work Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to education—and it's pleasing to see this particularly specified—the importance of ensuring children and, frankly, people of all ages are able to access a quality education from anywhere in the country is something where we've been going backwards for a long period of time now. This is another area where the neoliberal agenda has caused so much damage to our communities, to human opportunities and to what is a crucial sector not just for economic and employment opportunities in the future; let's not forget that the education area itself is a major employer, particularly in regional areas. For all of the talk about mines in Central Queensland, the biggest employer in Rockhampton is the Central Queensland University. In Cairns, when I was meeting with the chamber of commerce just last week, they reminded me that, after tourism—which is, not surprisingly, the top employer, the top job generator, for that region—the second biggest is education. So, when we have our education sector being harmed and cuts to university funding under this government, it's the regional universities and it's the jobs in those regions that are being put at risk right now, as well as the future opportunities for the young people of those regions being put at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a world-class system of vocational and further education that has been deliberately destroyed purely on ideological grounds. One of the great reforms of the Whitlam era was the abolition of university fees, yet they were reintroduced in 1988 by another Labor government, which reflected just how much they and the political class as a whole had been captured by neoliberalism. People can only get a quality education, as is emphasised in this debate, if it's affordable and if it's available at all. Under the policies of both the parties of the political establishment, things have been going backwards there. The Greens will continue to turn things around with the policy suite they've been promoting proudly and strongly.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  Before I start, can I just remind Senator Bartlett that it was the Greens who helped the Liberals cut pensions. There was a quote from someone—I can't remember who it was—on the other side along the lines that Senator Di Natale had constructively engaged with the government on this measure, so you might just like to remember that, Senator Bartlett.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's something that our now Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, said 2½ years ago that will come back to haunt him. He said this when he announced that he was challenging Mr Abbott for the leadership of the Liberal Party:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The one thing that is clear about our current situation is the trajectory. We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their minds about Mr Abbott's leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Mr Turnbull is now two Newspolls away from failing his own test, and he can't walk away from what he said. It's not a test that his party set for him. It's not one that the media set, and it's not one that we set for him. This is the test that Mr Turnbull set for himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be obvious to those opposite, as it is to most Australians, what the core of the problem really is. It's not just the chaos and the disunity within this government, as loud and as broad as that is; it's its failure to come up with policies that address the challenges facing everyday Australians and their aspirations for the future. Those on the other side have squandered any opportunity they had to be a government that is focused on the future and that governs for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Set out in Senator Collins's MPI are a number of policy areas where this policy failure is particularly apparent. On climate change, Mr Turnbull's Direct Action climate policy has been a complete failure, and his long-awaited climate change review has offered no new or alternative climate policy. The government's own projections show carbon pollution rising between now and 2030 rather than going anywhere near its target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction. The government has no climate change policies beyond 2020 and has made no commitment to long-term emission reduction targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On cost-of-living pressures, the government has comprehensively failed to tackle the rising costs of housing, school and childcare expenses and electricity bills, and in many cases it has made it worse. Australians wanting to afford health care are hit with the double whammy of skyrocketing private health insurance and the government's Medicare rebate freeze.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost-of-living pressures have of course been exacerbated by the pressures on Australia's incomes. Wages growth is now at a record low, thanks to the government's relentless attack on the pay and conditions of Australians. The failure of wages growth to keep pace with Australia's economy is leading to growing levels of inequality. The situation certainly hasn't been helped by the Turnbull government's cut to penalty rates for retail and hospitality workers, which has cut the wages of thousands of Australia's lowest paid workers by up to $77 a week, and now the government is talking down the minimum wage increase too. As for the government's education policy, their $17 billion cut to schools has hit school systems hard. Most of the cuts have hit the schools that need the funding most. Eighty-six per cent of the cuts have been borne by public schools and 12 per cent by Catholic schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, Labor want to see schools across Australia able to invest in regional and remote students, in students with disability, in Indigenous students and in students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. We want to see schools where teachers can get the support they need in the classrooms for those students who need that extra assistance, and this is why we initiated the Gonski review and followed its recommendations, and this is why we will reverse the Turnbull government's savage $17 billion cuts to schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have comprehensively costed plans to address the other areas where this government has failed dismally to show any leadership. We will legislate within the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government to restore the penalty rates for workers who've been affected by the government's cruel pay cuts. We will reform negative gearing so that we can help young Australians to buy their first home. We will modernise the National Electricity Market to give more power to consumers, and Labor will take real action on climate change with a six-point plan which includes achieving a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But right now we're stuck with a government that are sleepwalking towards electoral defeat because they are gripped by policy paralysis. They have no serious policies to address the problems facing Australians. They have no serious policies around facing the rising cost of living, stagnating wage growth, the threat of climate change or the need for a quality education. The major policy platform of this government seems to be more about union-bashing— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted by our Senate colleague from Victoria Senator Collins. Senator Collins would like the chamber to consider an extraordinary breadth of subjects in a single MPI, breaking with the convention—and, dare I say it, the commonsense tactic—of using an MPI to raise a single issue for consideration by the Senate. Senator Collins has instead unloaded a stream-of-consciousness diatribe in policy areas, and one might better ask the question: what didn't Senator Collins ask the chamber to consider this afternoon? Nonetheless, Senator Collins has asked the Senate to consider:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The need for polices that address cost of living pressures, climate change, the undermining of wages and conditions, and the importance of ensuring children from any postcode in Australia, city, or country, can get a quality education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I barely know where to begin, begin I must, and particularly on cost-of-living pressures—an issue that, you know, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, is particularly important to this government and one that we take very seriously indeed. How very galling it is that a representative here of the Labor Party would bring up cost-of-living concerns, when in fact her party's contribution to the energy debate has been limited to an obstructive and blind commitment to a 50 per cent renewable energy target. Or—hang on—is it a 75 per cent commitment? No, wait—it's a 40 per cent renewable energy target. To be honest, I am not sure what it is, because it changes with the winds of political expedience. It really depends on whether you're campaigning in South Australia or whether you're campaigning in Batman. The Labor Party's commitment to the truly random 50 per cent renewable energy target is nothing more than a capitulation to the green-left flank of its own party, and Senator Collins knows full well that it will have absolutely no effect whatsoever on global temperatures or climate change. It will, however, dramatically reduce energy reliability and, ultimately, increase energy prices for Australian households. So does Senator Collins really want to discuss this today—a day after the Labor Party lost government and was sacrificed in South Australia on the altar of renewable energy zealotry? It beggars belief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is amazing, too, that Senator Collins has asked this chamber to consider cost-of-living pressures, when the ACTU's Sally McManus has come up with the perfect solution—a living wage. Betraying an Alberici-esque grasp of economics, Sally McManus has lobbied for a massive living-wage increase of 60 per cent of the average wage. But do not for a second be fooled, for a living wage is nothing more than a significant increase in the minimum wage, and the last person to implement a living wage increase of this magnitude was in fact former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who, in 1973, raised minimum wages by 27 per cent. And, of course, in its wake, we saw unemployment balloon and inflation skyrocket, harming the very people that Prime Minister Gough Whitlam wanted to protect—low-income earners and pensioners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even Mr Whitlam was forced to concede that employees can in fact price themselves out of the market, and the ALP's then Minister for Labour, Clyde Cameron, complained in 1974 that—wait for it—'union bloody-mindedness' was 'slowly but surely pricing thousands of Australian workers out of employment'. Will history repeat itself? If Sally McManus is pulling the strings of the opposition leader then inevitably it will, for the call on an unrealistic rise in the minimum wage is exactly what Mr Shorten announced to the National Press Club earlier this year. The politics of envy and grievance form the foundation of Labor's pitch to voters, and that is the elephant in the room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor want to talk about cost-of-living pressures, but they want to address that not with effective policy at the source but through fistfuls of handouts for sectional interests. Rather than growing the economy, increasing the number of jobs and using basic laws of supply and demand to organically increase wages in a non-inflationary and sustainable way, the Labor Party have absolutely no plan whatsoever to grow the economy. They have no plan for jobs, no plan for growth and no plan for business growth—nothing. Instead, there are plenty of announcements of how Labor intend to punish people that they don't like—people who don't vote for them, people who invest, people who save, people who run a family business, people who don't want to be a burden to the public purse, people who just want to get ahead and people who choose to manage their own superannuation. And therein lies the nub.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we can agree that last week's policy announcement was a massive misfire. At the behest of the industry superannuation fund sector, who are the only beneficiaries of a less-attractive self-managed superannuation fund market, the Labor Party announced it would be removing legitimate refunds of tax already paid on dividends to those who pay low or no tax, calling them 'rorters', 'fat cats' and 'the top end of town'. When it became all too apparent that this harebrained policy disproportionately affects low-income earners and pensioners who have set that little bit aside in blue chip Australian shares, Mr Shorten generously told them that he will make it up to them through an increase in their part-pension. 'Don't worry,' he said. 'It may be rightfully your money, earned legitimately, tax already paid, but I am going to take it from you and redistribute it where I think it could be better used. Trust me; I'm from Labor.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake, Mr Shorten is a clear and present danger to the future prosperity of our great nation. He has no plan to create jobs, no plan to increase wages and no plan to grow our economy. And now, by promising to steal dividends earned legitimately from the savings of those who deserve our thanks and not our condemnation, Mr Shorten has tipped over Labor's promises into more than $200 billion of new taxes. That is almost the GDP of New Zealand that Mr Shorten will be taking away from your pay packet, from your pension, from your investments and from your business. He has forgotten the Winston Churchill proverb that a nation trying to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle; it is simply impossible. 'Shortenomics' is the greatest threat this country has seen in decades.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much as I would love to, I simply haven't got the time here today to go into the importance of ensuring that children from any postcode can get a quality education. But, if the meandering words of today's MPI, let alone the dodgy maths of the policy announcements coming from the ALP, are anything to go by then, please, let that quality education include some basic economics because, if it was taught at school when Senator Collins was there, I think she must have been taking a sickie.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I rise to speak on today's MPI and do so to agree with the statement, particularly in reference to ensuring children from any postcode in Australia, city or country, can get a quality education. I point to commentary last week—hurtful commentary by government ministers, members, candidates and the media—in which those opposite have been advocating for a one-size-fits-all approach to the adoption of children in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. It is frightening and it is ill informed. I understand some of their concerns. Indeed, I share some of their concerns in regard to the safety, wellbeing and future of our children, which we know is absolutely paramount for any child, in any postcode, in any city, in any bush country town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sexual violence is a terrible crime and is even more horrifying when committed against a child. It's tragic and it's awful, but our responses should not become a competition of outrage, of who is more outraged than the next person. It is actually about humanity rising above—transcending—the differences that we have, and knowing that it is about caring. It does not mean that we should revert to removing children from their homes, their families and their culture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of educating and protecting our children, the Territory government has already taken substantive steps to reform youth justice and child protection, investing in new bail support services, accommodation facilities and family and youth supports. This demonstrates the absolute seriousness with which the Territory government has taken the royal commission's findings and its understanding of the need for wholesale reform of a broken youth justice system. I urge the Turnbull government to take responsibility and negotiate in good faith and work collaboratively with Chief Minister Michael Gunner and the Northern Territory government so that the royal commission's findings can be implemented and so that every child, everywhere, has a solid future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First-nations people and organisations must be front and centre in developing solutions. Governments must work with first nations people in the co-design and delivery of programs. It's absolutely unhelpful to take the advice of ill-informed commentators—for example, the commentators on the Channel 7 <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunrise </span>program, who have yet to include first nations people in their conversations. Safe, secure housing has to feature in keeping children safe. It will also play a critical role in addressing the cost-of-living pressures for the parents and/or guardians of vulnerable children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately the Turnbull government has walked away from investing in remote housing. We know of the high rates of homelessness. Katherine has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the Northern Territory. We have families who are living with 15 people in their homes because these houses cannot be built. There are no commitments to SA, WA and Queensland. The minister has backflipped on his original commitment to match the NT's $1.1 billion investment in regional and remote housing. We desperately need this funding so our communities can thrive. Closing remote communities, calling for another NT intervention and calling for the removal of more Indigenous children from their families is a knee-jerk response to complex, deep-rooted issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know widespread child removal is not a panacea. We know culture and child safety are not mutually exclusive. The safety of the child is always paramount. Unlike those opposite, Labor will do something positive to ensure our children have the best chance in life. In our first 100 days in office, Labor will convene a national summit on first nations children. The summit will bring governments and experts together to help find solutions to this crisis, working with first nations people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every child has a right to grow up healthy, happy and safe. Every child has a right to a roof over their head. Every child has a right to world-class education, no matter where they live. Kids in the Northern Territory don't deserve to have their future stifled. They don't deserve the $15 million in funding cuts from the Northern Territory's premier university, Charles Darwin University. They deserve to be more than safe; they deserve to have a roof over their heads; they deserve proper access to medical facilities— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="144138" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  They say that a camel is a horse designed by a committee. I think we can say with great confidence that this matter of public importance today was definitely designed by a committee. It would have been fascinating to have been a fly on the wall in the Labor tactics committee meeting this morning. I'm assuming that perhaps Senator Farrell, after a devastating loss in his home state of South Australia on the weekend, having learned his lesson that the environmental policies pursued by the Weatherill government came at a great political cost to the Labor Party and having no doubt recognised the detrimental effect that his ideological embrace of renewable energy has had on household budgets, came into the meeting and said: 'Guys, we have to talk about the cost of living. Can we make sure that's the MPI today.' Perhaps it was Senator Pratt from WA, passionate environmentalist that she is, who said: 'No, no, no, no. We shouldn't be talking about the cost of living. We have to talk about climate change. That's what the people of Australia want to hear from us.' Maybe it was Senator Carr, devoted union man that he is, who said: 'No. We should be talking about the wages and conditions of Australian workers.' Probably, it would have been Senator Collins herself who said: 'No. I'm on the education committee; I'm passionate about schools. Why can't we make an MPI today about education?' Clearly, they couldn't agree. So instead of making the difficult decision of picking just one topic for the MPI today they said: 'Why not have four?' It's like the ad for Old El Paso: 'Por que no los dos?' I apologise for my ineffective pronunciation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why today we have an MPI covering four issues. It's a 37-word motion, as I counted. The English teachers of Australia are calling out for a full stop in there somewhere. Reading out the MPI is liable to make one run out of breath.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I faced a dilemma myself when thinking about my contribution to this debate: which of its many and varied issues would I choose to make a contribution on? I couldn't go past the cost-of-living pressures, because it has been particularly galling to hear the Labor Party come into this chamber today, one week after announcing a plan to smash the household budgets of retirees, and talk about the cost-of-living pressures that Australians face. I will make one political observation before I get to the substance of the policy. I have been very bemused in the last 24 hours to hear it said by some of those opposite and by some of their allies and friends in the media that the Batman by-election victory for the Labor Party is vindication of their policy to abolish dividend imputation. I have to say that I don't think that the Labor Party retaining a seat that it has held for 100 years, more or less—against the most shambolic and hopeless Greens campaign that we've seen in their recent attempts to take that seat—is exactly an endorsement of their policy. I'm not sure that Batman, regarded as the most left-wing seat in the country, could be taken to be representative of the rest of Australia, and I suspect that had that by-election been held somewhere else in Australia, perhaps in the suburbs of my home state of Victoria or any other state in this country, the result might have been different. No doubt it would have been different, given the absolutely insane nature of this policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest about the political strategy being employed by the opposition and Mr Bill Shorten. He is clearly setting out to raise revenue through new and higher taxes from groups in the community who he thinks are unsympathetic—who he may not have sympathy for, who the Labor Party might not have sympathy for. For example, he has identified people who own investment properties and said, 'We'll take some money from you.' He has looked at companies and thought, 'They're not very popular. We'll take some money from them.' He's looked at people who operate family trusts and thought, 'We'll take some money from you;' at people on high incomes: 'We'll take some more from you;' and now, finally, at pensioners and self-funded retirees: 'We'll take some money from you, as well.' What he plans to do with this money he takes from groups in the community that he thinks are unpopular is spend it in ways that are more politically beneficial for him. He's going to spend it in populist ways. He's going to hand it out to groups in the community who might be more open to voting Labor. That is clearly the political strategy here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't pretend that this is a policy that has been carefully thought through or has been carefully designed. We shouldn't pretend that this is a policy that is trying to respond to genuine public policy issues. It is a smash-and-grab raid for the money saved by many retirees to provide for their own retirement so they're not reliant on the pension or are less reliant on the pension in their old age. Mr Shorten wants to come and take it so he can give it to others in the community who he thinks are more likely to vote for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a $59 billion tax hit, yet another of the many tax hits announced by Mr Shorten since the last election, now totalling more than $200 billion. It will mean less money in the pockets of more than one million Australians, especially retirees and pensioners on low incomes. As we have now discovered from ATO tax statistics, more than half of the franking credit refunds were paid to individuals who are over the age of 65. Of the individuals who receive a franking credit refunds, 97 per cent have an income below $87,000. I wouldn't have thought that Mr Shorten or the Labor Party would regard people with an income below $87,000 as being in any way, shape or form rich or wealthy people, yet these are the people that he is going after in order to raise revenue to give to others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than half of all the refunded franking credits are paid to individuals with a taxable income below the $18,200 tax-free threshold. That means people whose income is so low that they don't pay any income tax at all, and yet Mr Shorten wants to take a franking credit away from them. It will impact about 40 per cent of self-managed super funds, which affects 370,000 member accounts and retirement savings for 3.5 million super fund accounts. You would have heard the contribution from the member for Hume earlier in which she identified one of the beneficiaries of this policy being the industry super movement, and she would know; she's been in the belly of the beast. This is not only a blatant tax grab; in my view, this shows that the Labor Party are guilty of lying to the Australian public. The ALP's own website still suggests that an earlier $15 billion tax hike on retirement savings is the final and only change that Labor will make to tax treatment of superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really important point: there are people who have planned for their retirement carefully over many years who are now in retirement and there is not much that they can do to change the plans that they put in place years ago. We in this place, on both sides—on all angles of this chamber—have put the rules in place for their retirement and they've planned accordingly. Many of these people are too old to go back to work. They don't have options to restructure their finances, and some of them have very modest means. But the rug has been well and truly pulled out from underneath them with no way for them to respond. It will mean a very real loss of income and I suspect—going back to the motion today—it will have a severe impact on the cost of living for many of these people. I urge the Labor Party to reconsider what I think has already been proven to be a disastrous policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the MPI, which goes to cost-of-living issues. It's disappointing that, when given the opportunity to speak on the issues that impact ordinary Australians, Senator Paterson and Senator Hume chose to take that opportunity to talk about the Labor Party—to obfuscate and engage in political hyperbole and talk about Labor's principled position in respect of tax reform, a proposal which 92 per cent of taxpayers are unaffected by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about cost-of-living issues and I particularly want to talk about the issue which even the Treasurer identified as being the greatest single threat to the Australian economy, and that is wages growth. Wages growth is at historically low levels despite the fact that we have enjoyed 26 years of continuous economic growth, and cost-of-living pressures are therefore weighing heavily on low- and middle-income households. So, having put it out there that this is the greatest single threat to the Australian economy, what has the government done about this issue? The government put out the company tax cut proposal, which is their centrepiece—from which all good things will come and, according to them, will lead to wages growth. That is trickle-down economics and patently absurd. The Australian people don't buy that story anymore, but that remains the government's centrepiece. The Treasurer also talked about productivity growth. But, at a time when productivity is continuing to grow, wages are flatlining. So the Treasurer is completely out of touch on that issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear that average workers are not getting the benefit of that economic growth. Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Australian Workers' Union and ETU protest outside the ExxonMobil facility at Longford. At that time, those workers had been protesting for 265 days and taking a principled stand against a 30 per cent wage cut being imposed on them by one of the subcontracting firms within the ExxonMobil facility. They were taking that principled stand not only for themselves but also for other workers and their children. They saw it as very important to take that position. So we know that the rules are broken when it comes to enterprise bargaining. The government could take the opportunity to talk about that issue, but they are silent on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national wage case decision is coming up, which presents a very important opportunity to address the issue of wages. We know that the outcomes of the national wage case have flow-on effects throughout the economy. What particularly disappointed me was the submission to the wage case by the National Retail Association, where they have come out and said that they are proposing a zero per cent wage increase for workers across the economy. What are the government doing about that? How can they stand by silently whilst that sort of nonsense is being put out there? I say: shame on the National Retail Association for putting it out there. They had the gall to indicate that the explanation for that policy was in part the fact that retailers did not enjoy spending growth in the pre-Christmas period, which is when they traditionally get a pick-up in retail sales. Of course, it's quite clear that, if you give workers a zero per cent wage increase, next Christmas we're going to see an even worse outcome in retail sales in the lead-up to Christmas. So that is a very short-sighted policy position from the National Retail Association and I call on them to change their position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believe in affordable healthcare and education options and affordable insurance. We believe in cracking down on corporate tax dodgers.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to that Retail Association submission, what added insult to injury from my perspective was that not only are the retailers asking for a zero per cent wage increase; they're also continuing to enjoy the benefits of the penalty rate cuts which are flowing through the system. Again, the government are silent on that. In fact, they have done nothing about those penalty rate cuts, which are impacting on the cost-of-living pressures for ordinary workers. It's time for the government to get on with the job and do something about this issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This document is a performance audit by the Auditor-General into funding models for threatened species management. When you open up an Auditor-General's report, you do not usually expect to immediately be reminded of Australia's globally distinct ecosystems, our immensely diverse flora and fauna and the richness of biodiversity that means Australia is recognised as one of the world's mega-diverse countries. Something that we often forget in Australia, whilst we recognise our magnificent natural environment and our wildlife, is just how incredibly diverse and unique it is, and how crucial that fact is to the long-term health not just of our environment but of all of the social and economic services that depend on a healthy, diverse environment. Approximately 85 per cent of our flowering plants, 84 per cent of our mammals, 45 per cent of our birds and 89 per cent of our reptiles occur only in Australia. Unfortunately, in the last couple of hundred years, more than 130 of Australia's known species have become extinct, three of those just since 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this audit report does is look at the funding models for the management of threatened species, because at the core of maintaining biodiversity is ensuring the diversity and the survival of all of those species—all of those different types of life. We are doing more and more poorly. Whilst this Auditor-General's report goes to the funding models and the way that they are being managed, at its core is a recognition that we are failing to deliver our obligations under the federal environment law. This government is failing to deliver. There is no doubt that our federal environment laws need a significant overhaul. There are gaps that need to be plugged. But what this government is doing is failing its obligations under the existing law by failing to properly fund what is required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report goes to the fact that this government has basically tried to contract out its obligations to the private sector. We've just had a debate in this place about the failure of the neoliberal model, the failure of the economic model that both the established parties of the political establishment have taken on board as a matter of political faith for the last few decades—that somehow or other government is better done by contracting it out to the private sector. This report shows that you cannot do that in an effective way and expect governments to meet their legal and, clearly, ethical obligations to the Australian community to prevent further extinction and to properly manage and address endangered species. You cannot contract that out to the private sector. But that's what we've seen with this government adopting the approach of free-market fundamentalism gone wild.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Auditor-General's report explicitly goes to the so-called <span style="font-style:italic;">Threatened species prospectus</span> that this government put forward just over a year ago. The audit assesses the effectiveness of the design of that <span style="font-style:italic;">Threatened species prospectus</span>. It's couched in the usual Auditor-General's language, but it clearly identifies that there is a lack of a fit-for-purpose performance framework. There's an inability to properly assess adequacy, even on its own merits—and, let me be clear: this proposal, this policy approach from the government, is grossly flawed. It is a piecemeal approach. It is contracting out the core, central role of the government, to ensure that the legal obligations are properly fulfilled in a systemic way. You don't just protect the threatened species that you can manage to find some funding for, the ones that are most easy to market. It's not a competitive arrangement amongst the threatened species of our country, to try to compete to see who can attract private sector funding to make sure that their habitat is not destroyed. There are no mechanisms in this approach to prevent the ongoing destruction of habitat, whether it's by logging, mining or all of those things that are destroying economic opportunities as well as destroying the biodiversity opportunities and the biodiversity heritage of this country.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this Auditor-General's report, couched, as it is, in its own dry economic language, is actually good reading for people who want to get a grip on the economic irresponsibility of trying to apply a market based approach, a neoliberal approach, to a fundamental aspect of environmental management and, let's be clear, the legal obligations of this federal government, under our federal environment law, to properly manage and address threatened species. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  I will speak only briefly, to add to Senator Bartlett's remarks about this Audit Office report on funding models for threatened species management. I urge anyone who is concerned about the way that this government is not addressing our threatened species to read this report, because it shows that, even within the very limited framework that the government is applying, it is failing to do that adequately. This report shows, first of all, the lack of consistency, the totally ad hoc nature of this attempt to get private funding into the management of threatened species, the lack of a framework that was established at the beginning of the process and the lack of consultation with the threatened species advisory committee. Even in the limited framework that's been set up, this approach with the prospectus has failed. It just goes to the heart of the lack of attention and the lack of importance that this government places on threatened species. If we were serious about protecting threatened species, we would not be acting in such a random, ad hoc, ineffective, inconsistent and fundamentally underfunded way to protect our precious animals and plants, which are special, which are unique to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this report doesn't go to is the fact that even the species that are being focused on in this prospectus are only a small portion of the threatened species that need programs to be put in place to address them. It talks about the fact that the species included in the prospectus were chosen in a pretty random, ad hoc way and chosen without adequate consultation. But what it doesn't show is that there are a whole range of other species that this government and the Threatened Species Commissioner have deliberately chosen not to include.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important because, if you hear this government talk about its approach to threatened species, it talks about the Threatened Species Commissioner role as being of fundamental importance. It talked about the prospectus as being a fundamental measure, a tool, to address threatened species. Yet that is not succeeding there, and it is leaving a whole raft of other species completely underresourced in terms of the measures that need to be taken to address them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the threatened species that weren't included in the prospectus are those under threat from habitat destruction due to resource exploitation. I'm particularly talking about logging operations and mining operations. With logging operations, we know that the species that weren't included in this prospectus include ones like the Leadbeater's possums, which are affected by logging in Victoria's Central Highlands. They include species like greater gliders, which have now become vulnerable because of loss of habitat due to logging operations. These weren't even mentioned in the prospectus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even under the limited scope that has been outlined, they are doing it badly. It speaks volumes, and it shows that the approach of this government is completely inadequate to protect our precious plants and animals; that we need to have a serious, whole-of-government approach to address the protection of our species, the plants and animals that are threatened; and that we need to have serious resources put into it. You can't just hope that you're going to get private sector funding to help address threatened species. In fact, the lofty aims of this prospectus to gain millions of dollars of funding have so far resulted in only two projects having private sector funding, one to the tune of $200,000; the other, only $10,000. It is not the way forward. It is not how we are going to address threatened species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can put the money into it, and we need to if we're going to protect these animals. We can cut the tax breaks for the big end of town. We can raise revenue of billions of dollars by making sure that we get rid of fossil fuel subsidies for the mining industry, for example. We can invest serious money into our threatened species, and that's what we need to do if we are going to have animals like the Leadbeater's possum actually pulled back from extinction, if we are going to have the plants and animals that we appreciate today continuing to be available in our natural environments, and particularly in our forests, for our children and grandchildren to enjoy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">NATIONAL HOUSING FINANCE AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION BILL 2018</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">SECOND READING SPEECH</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill establishes the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (the NHFIC), a new independent corporate Commonwealth entity which will improve housing outcomes for Australians, particularly vulnerable Australians who need social and affordable housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NHFIC, which is modelled on successful initiatives in the United Kingdom, will strengthen efforts to increase the supply of housing by encouraging investment in housing, particularly in social and affordable housing. It will contribute to developing the scale, efficiency and effectiveness of the community housing sector and will provide loans, grants and investments that complement, leverage and support Commonwealth, state and territory activities relating to housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Housing is critical to the social and economic wellbeing of Australians, and the economy as a whole. It can impact on employment, education and health outcomes, and is a significant driver of investment, productivity and economic growth. It is also the main savings vehicle for the majority of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While housing is primarily a state responsibility, the Commonwealth Government nonetheless has an important role to play when it comes to addressing housing affordability and securing better outcomes for Australians, particularly the most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth expenditure for housing in 2016-17 totalled $7.6 billion, comprising $4.4 billion in Commonwealth Rent Assistance and $3.2 billion in housing and homelessness funding including through the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) and the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As announced in last year's Budget, the Government is currently working on a new improved funding agreement with the states and territories, the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. We are seeking to improve the outcomes of this significant funding, given that despite the Commonwealth providing states and territories more than $9 billion since 2009, three out of four of the benchmarks under the NAHA have not been, or are unlikely, to be met. Around 40,000 Australians are currently on waiting lists for community housing, and an additional 148,000 are on public housing waiting lists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new Agreement will ask for more transparency from the states and territories and will make homelessness funding indexed and permanent for the first time. The <span style="font-style:italic;">National Housing and Homelessness Agreement Bill</span>, which establishes the framework for the new Agreement is currently before the Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The initiatives outlined in this Bill are one part of the comprehensive housing affordability plan announced in the 2017-18 Budget. This plan will improve outcomes across the housing spectrum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has already legislated a number of the elements announced as part of that plan. Last year, we passed legislation to create the First Home Super Saver Scheme, shamefully opposed by the Opposition, which will provide a tax cut for first home buyers and enable them to save 30 per cent faster through voluntary super contributions. We are also working to identify and dispose of surplus Commonwealth land that is suitable for housing, beginning with Defence land at Maribyrnong in Melbourne. We have established the Australian Government Property Register to make this process transparent and allow the public to propose better uses for Commonwealth land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NHFIC will deliver another important part of our housing affordability plan. The NHFIC will administer the $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility and an Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator. These functions will allow the NHFIC to both provide community housing providers with finance and assistance in capacity building and to make loans, investments and grants to improve housing outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All financing and investment decisions will be made by an independent, skills-based Board, with the Chair and members appointed by the Government for terms of up to five years, which will ensure decisions are sound and commercially based. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Independence of the Board's decision making will cultivate credibility in financial markets and provide the Board with the flexibility to perform its functions effectively and efficiently, and to tailor finance to the needs of recipients, mindful of any risks involved. The experience of the Housing Affordability Fund established by the previous government underlies the importance of this independent decision making process. The Australian National Audit Office found that there were serious shortcomings in the administration of the Housing Affordability Fund and that some approved projects were not selected on a merit basis, or in accordance with established guidelines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the practices of other Commonwealth corporate entities recently established, the Government will outline its expectations of the NHFIC in an Investment Mandate, [a draft of which was released for consultation yesterday]. However, the Government will not be able to direct the Corporation in relation to particular loans, investments or grants, or in relation to particular projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Providing the particulars of the NHFIC's activities in the Investment Mandate rather than in this Bill allows the legislative framework to be flexible and nimble and to adjust, within the scope permitted by the Bill, to the needs of community housing providers and other recipients of financial support. The Bill specifies the matters that will be covered by the Investment Mandate, including: decision-making criteria; eligibility; limits on the making of loans, investments and grants; strategies and policies to be followed; and risk and return on investments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Housing Infrastructure Facility will help to finance the critical infrastructure that is needed to unlock and accelerate new housing supply, particularly affordable housing. The Government anticipates that the Infrastructure Facility could support the development of 'mixed tenure' projects that combine affordable and private housing and provide broader community benefits, including housing, that enable key workers such as police and nurses to live near their places of work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has committed $1 billion to the Infrastructure Facility in the form of up to $175 million in grants and $825 million in concessional loans and equity investments. The financial assistance available will encourage and complement private sector and state and local government investment and facilitate the delivery of critical housing-related infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Eligible infrastructure projects will include transport links, power and water infrastructure and site remediation works. Eligible, recipients will include local governments; state, territory, and local government-owned corporations and utility providers; and registered community housing providers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NHFIC will need to ensure that it funds projects that satisfy the appropriate regulatory and environmental standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NHFIC will be able to reinvest the capital and earnings gained through the Infrastructure Facility, allowing it to grow over time. It will be able to tailor its provision of finance to best suit the needs of individual projects, with any concessions calibrated to the particular circumstances of the project, and will provide the minimum amount of assistance required to enable a proposal to proceed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NHFIC's other key function will be to operate a Bond Aggregator for the community housing sector. The Bond Aggregator will improve the efficiency of financing for registered community housing providers and build the capacity of the sector. It will offer finance tailored to the needs of providers, funded through the issue of bonds, backed by a legislative guarantee, which will provide the best price outcome for providers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Community housing providers supply subsidised housing for some of our most vulnerable people. The new Bond Aggregator will give providers greater financial certainty and enable them to improve housing outcomes for their existing clients and build scale to provide services to new clients. There is a clear appetite from institutional investors, such as superannuation funds, for a new asset class of social impact investments which provide longer term fixed cash flows and deliver better outcomes to the community, and we hope to see this reflected in engagement with the Bond Aggregator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final design details of both the NHFIC and its functions of operating the Infrastructure Facility and Bond Aggregator are the result of extensive consultation and the valuable involvement of many stakeholders over, in some cases, a number of years. I would like to thank in particular the Affordable Housing Working Group, comprised of officials from the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia; and the Affordable Housing Implementation Taskforce; as well as the dedicated officials in my Department who have been working on this for some time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another important feature of the Bill is that it provides a legislative guarantee for the NHFIC's liabilities. The Bill provides for the capacity for the guarantee to be withdrawn in the future if it is no longer needed for new contracts. This would be dependent on both the Corporation achieving sufficient maturity and scale and the community housing sector taking on a larger-scale and more prominent role in sub‑market rental housing, including through partnerships with the private sector and institutional investors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To provide certainty to investors it may only be withdrawn by the Government on a prospective basis after 1 July 2023 and with at least 60 days' notice. The availability of the guarantee will strengthen market confidence and thereby improve the NHFIC's ability to achieve its purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NHFIC is intended to be financially self-sustaining in the medium to long-term. The profits and funds returned from its investments will be available for reinvestment. In time, the NHFIC may accumulate surplus funds and be in a position to return a dividend to the Commonwealth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill provides for a post implementation review to be carried out three years after the commencement of the Bill to ensure that the NHFIC is delivering its intended benefits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Passage of this Bill during the current sitting period will facilitate the necessary preparations to enable the Corporation to undertake its Infrastructure Facility and Bond Aggregator activities from 1 July 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">SECOND READING SPEECH</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill deals with consequential and transitional matters arising from the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, it amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</span> to exempt the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) from the requirement to provide a statement setting out the findings and reasons for decisions relating to its activities where requested, for example by an unsuccessful applicant. This exemption will ensure the efficient administration of the NHFIC and is consistent with the exemption afforded to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also amends Schedule 2 to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Information Act 1982</span> to exempt the NHFIC from the requirements of that Act in relation to documents pertaining to its commercial activities. This is similar to the exemption that applies on the commercial activities of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, NBN Co and other entities, such as Indigenous Business Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, it provides for a transitional provision related to the operations of the NHFIC. While the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018</span> is intended to commence as soon as possible, the Government recognises that some time will be required for the NHFIC to be staffed—for example, for appointments to be made to the independent, skills based Board and a full time CEO to be engaged—as well as for the NHFIC's strategic policies and administrative processes and procedures to be developed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has always been the Government's intention that the NHFIC will commence making decisions regarding the making of loans, investments or grants—that is, its core function—from 1 July 2018, and this is reflected in the transitional provision contained in this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Passage of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018 and this Bill during the current sitting will enable the NHFIC to undertake its Infrastructure Facility and Bond Aggregator activities from 1 July 2018. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I introduce a Bill to implement two Government measures—a new regulatory regime for financial benchmarks used in Australia and the appointment of a new Indigenous Policy Commissioner to the Productivity Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 to this Bill delivers on the Government's commitment to strengthen financial regulation and better protect Australians from the possible abuse and manipulation of financial markets by sophisticated financial institutions at their expense.</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$127.2 million to enhance the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's powers, data analytics and surveillance capabilities and allow ASIC to take more surveillance and enforcement action;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a comprehensive review of ASIC's enforcement regime to ensure that it adequately deters misconduct and fosters consumer confidence; and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the implementation of a new Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which will strengthen the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's powers to remove, disqualify and penalise senior executives from any prudentially regulated institution.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Financial benchmarks are used to value trillions of dollars of financial products. Unfortunately however, both internationally and domestically, there have been significant shortcomings in the regulation of these benchmarks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Globally, there have been many cases of market misconduct regarding the determination of financial benchmarks, particularly interest rate benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offer Rate. As of August 2017, penalties paid by financial institutions globally had reached around AUD25 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has not been immune to such conduct. When we came to Government we inherited evidence of significant abuse for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2013, a number of global institutions entered enforceable undertakings with ASIC in relation to their conduct regarding the Bank Bill Swap Rate—Australia's most important interest rate benchmark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More recently, ASIC commenced formal court proceedings against three of our four major banks for alleged market manipulation and unconscionable conduct in relation to the BBSW. This case is ongoing. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, in response to these issues and regulatory developments overseas, I directed the Council of Financial Regulators—the Government's peak advisor on financial regulatory issues of systemic importance—to consult on options to reform the regulation of financial benchmarks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government accepted this advice and this Schedule implements these reforms.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these reforms will enhance the robustness of these critical components of our market architecture and help ensure continued confidence in Australia's financial system. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I will now provide additional detail on these reforms. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following Royal Assent, all administrators of 'significant' benchmarks will be required to hold a new benchmark administrator license issued by ASIC, or receive an exemption. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Significant benchmarks will be designated by ASIC in a legislative instrument—with the consent of the Minister—if:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">there is a material risk of financial contagion, or systemic instability, if the availability or integrity of the benchmark was disrupted; or</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">there would be a material impact on investors in Australia if the availability or integrity of the benchmark were disrupted.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other benchmark administrators will also be able to 'opt in' to the licensing regime if they believe that it is advantageous to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By only requiring the administrators of 'significant' benchmarks to obtain a license, the Government has appropriately balanced the need to ensure the integrity of Australia's financial system, against the additional regulatory costs associated with a more heavy handed approach to licensing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Once licensed, a benchmark administrator will be subject to a range of ongoing supervision and regulatory requirements, including an obligation to assist ASIC, APRA and the Reserve Bank of Australia in the fulfilment of any of their statutory functions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Licensees will also have to comply with enforceable ASIC rules based on the International Organization of Securities Commissions' <span style="font-style:italic;">Principles for Financial Benchmarks</span>, in line with global best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with the Principles, these rules will impose requirements relating to IT security, business continuity planning, and the separation of business functions (aimed at limiting the potential for manipulation). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that benchmarks can continue to be generated during times of financial market stress, ASIC will also have the power to compel market participants to make submissions to ensure the continued generation of a financial benchmark. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even though no significant Australian benchmark currently relies on submissions as a matter of course, given the significant market disruption that would occur if such a benchmark was not generated, this power is crucial to: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">future-proof the regulatory regime; and </span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">provide investors with confidence with regards to the robustness and availability of significant benchmarks. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is also a power of last resort. ASIC will only use this tool in the situation where the continued generation of a significant benchmark is under serious threat and the failure to generate that benchmark would have significant consequences for the functioning of Australia's capital markets.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 to this Bill implements two of three reforms announced in the 2017-18 Budget, to improve tax integrity and reduce pressure on housing affordability by changing the capital gains tax rules for foreign residents. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, foreign residents will be denied access to the main residence capital gains tax exemption from 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 2017. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The main residence exemption allows individuals to disregard a capital gain they make on the sale of a property established as their main residence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, this schedule addresses an integrity issue with the capital gains tax rules for foreign residents that hold indirect interests in Australian real property, such as land, from 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 2017.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This reform addresses an integrity issue with one of these tests—the principal asset test—to require a foreign resident to consider any interests held by its associates, if it disposes of an indirect interest in Australian real property for example by selling shares in a land rich company. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This integrity fix will ensure that the principal asset test cannot be circumvented by disaggregating holdings of membership interests. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The third reform announced in the 2017-18 Budget, expanding the foreign resident capital gains tax withholding regime, has already been enacted and came into effect on 1 July 2017. The regime was expanded by increasing the withholding rate from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, and decreasing the withholding threshold from $2 million to $750,000 to capture more properties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Combined, these three integrity measures are expected to have a gain to revenue of $570.0 million over the forward estimates period. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 to this Bill contains technical amendments that introduce a reconciliation fee on developers for dwellings sold to foreign persons under a near-new dwelling exemption certificate. The near-new dwelling exemption certificate was introduced through regulatory amendments that took effect from 24 June 2017. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, capital gains arising from the sale of capital gains tax assets of individuals that are held for at least 12 months generally receive a 50 per cent capital gains discount. This includes residential investment properties that are supplied for affordable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this measure, an additional capital gains tax discount will be available to resident investors who hold affordable housing directly or through certain trusts, such as holding units within a managed investment trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Qualifying affordable housing will need to be managed through a registered community housing provider and provided as affordable housing for at least three years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Community housing providers will be responsible for assessing tenant eligibility. The Government does not want to duplicate state and territory housing policies, so community housing providers will need to assess tenant eligibility against relevant state and territory housing policies and registration requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure encourages increased investment in affordable rental housing and forms part of the Government's broader housing affordability package announced in the 2017-18 Budget. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure is estimated to have a cost to revenue of $15.0 million over the forward estimates period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will boost confidence in the professionalism of debt agreement administrators, deter unscrupulous practices and enhance transparency.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is the first major reform of the debt agreement system since 2007. The amendments include measures to modernise debt agreements to suit today's financial environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the increasing value of Australia's property market, we are doubling the asset threshold at which debtors can access the debt agreement system. The higher threshold will open the system to debtors with some equity in their family home. However, the system also requires appropriate safeguards.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under current arrangements, debt agreements can be proposed or extended to well beyond the five year mark. In some cases, they can extend beyond seven years. Longer debt agreements and subsequent variation of debt agreements is a sign that a debtor is unable to meet or maintain their obligations under the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will now require debt agreement proposals to include a payment timeframe that is three years or less. This measure will allow debtors to manage their debts in the short term and work towards a fresh start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite the benefits of the debt agreement system to both debtors and creditors, a minority of debt agreements propose to pay amounts which significantly exceed the debtor's income, imposing substantial financial stress on the debtor and their families. This is a contributing factor to the repeated variations and extensions to debt agreements that the existing scheme permits, keeping debtors in financial stress for longer periods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will address this concerning issue in a number of ways:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, we are introducing the innovative concept of a payment to income ratio – which will ensure proposals to set up or vary a debt agreement include an affordable payment schedule, whereby the total payments to be made do not exceed the debtor's income by a prescribed percentage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure the ratio is balanced and suited to the market, it will be determined by legislative instrument in close consultation with the debt agreement industry, consumer advocacy groups and creditor representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, we are bolstering the authority of the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy to intervene in exceptional cases and refuse to accept debt agreement proposals which would cause undue financial hardship to vulnerable debtors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms will also deter unscrupulous practices of a small minority of debt agreement administrators, by setting stricter practice standards, introducing tougher penalties for wrongdoing, and granting the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy additional investigative powers to address administrator misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To mitigate the risk to a debtor of debt agreement administrator error or malpractice, we are now requiring administrators to take out and maintain professional indemnity and fidelity insurance as a requirement of their registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This brings requirements for debt agreement administrators into line with registered trustees and provides a safety net for affected debtors and creditors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To boost confidence in the professionalism of the system, this Bill introduces a requirement that only those who meet enhanced registration benchmarks will be eligible to administer a debt agreement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An unregistered administrator will have 12 months from Royal Assent to the Bill to register as a debt agreement administrator or trustee if they wish to keep administering debt agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also enhances transparency, providing clarity to debtors and creditors about an administrator's financial and organisational arrangements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is essential that debtors and creditors have the opportunity to review any business practices of an administrator that might affect a debt agreement – for example, the administrator's expenses arrangements or any relationships with debt management brokers or referrers that an administrator may have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Requiring administrators to disclose their relationships is important because any money paid to brokers or referrers is money that could have been paid to creditors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments provide that a debt agreement proposal must disclose any relationships between administrators and brokers, and detail the types of expenses the administrator can recover, allowing debtors and creditors to make informed choices in proposing or accepting a debt agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The enhanced standards for debt agreement administrators will be further enhanced by the development of industry wide conditions, to be implemented by legislative instrument in conjunction with this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These conditions will be developed in close consultation with the debt agreement administrator industry, consumer advocacy groups and creditor representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a whole, these measures will ensure the debt agreement system is an effective, fair and functional debt management option for debtors and creditors alike. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will commence six months after Royal Assent, giving the debt agreement administrator industry enough time to prepare for the changes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first set of amendments concerns industry based numbering management. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications Act 1997 </span>currently requires the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA, to make a plan for the numbering of carriage services in Australia and the use of numbers in connection with the supply of services to the public. The numbering plan must specify the numbers for use and may set out rules for the allocation of numbers to carriage service providers, the transfer of numbers between carriage service providers, and the surrender of numbers by carriage service providers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will amend the Telecommunications Act to enable the Minister to appoint a 'numbering scheme manager' to manage numbering resources on behalf of the Commonwealth under a self-managed industry scheme. An industry managed numbering scheme has the potential to deliver faster implementation of new numbering ranges, lower charges and more efficient allocation processes. The scheme will need to achieve key principles specified in the legislation, including an adequate and appropriate supply of numbers, protection of the interests of consumers, the promotion of effective competition, support for the emergency call service and the ongoing collection of numbering charges. Any industry scheme would only commence if and when the Minister was satisfied that the scheme met these and other relevant principles and would be fully funded by industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As an important safeguard, the appointment of the numbering scheme manager could be revoked by the Minister if the numbering scheme manager was not managing the numbering scheme in accordance with the principles, or if the Minister was satisfied that the revocation was in the best interests of the telecommunications industry, users of telecommunications services, the general community or national security.</span>

ACMA obtains information from industry in preparing the report. The bill will provide more flexibility for ACMA to decide which matters to monitor and report on. ACMA will only be required to report on the operation of part 14 of the Telecommunications Act, regarding national interest matters, and the data retention requirements under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. </span>The Minister will retain the power to direct ACMA to report on specified matters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The extension of Australia's crowd-sourced equity funding framework to proprietary companies delivers on the announcement made in the 2017-18 Budget and demonstrates the Government's commitment to fostering a more innovative and creative Australian economy, by ensuring that start-ups and early stage businesses can access the funding they need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why this Government introduced the crowd-sourced equity funding framework for public companies late last year. Extending crowd‑sourced equity funding to private companies through this Bill will enable more innovative companies and start‑ups to obtain funding from a crowd of investors. In return for being able to have an unlimited number of crowdfunding shareholders, participating proprietary companies will have higher governance and reporting obligations to protect the larger number of investors they will be able to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the features of the existing public company framework which the Government introduced last year, such as the obligations of intermediaries and the process of making crowdfunding offers, will be the same for proprietary companies. This will reduce complexity for intermediaries, crowdfunding companies and investors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have consulted widely and have listened to entrepreneurs and businesses, who tell us that it can be difficult for innovative, early-stage businesses, who are often proprietary companies to access funding from traditional sources. Proprietary companies wanting to access equity crowdfunding will no longer have to convert to public company type, with its more onerous obligations. Instead, founders will be able to crowdfund while retaining the greater flexibility of the proprietary model. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Increasing the attractiveness of equity crowdfunding will also increase the pool of potential investments, giving investors the opportunity to share in the risks and successes of these growing businesses. Recognising that this extension is a new approach to the proprietary company framework in Australia, the Government has balanced the importance of investor protection, transparency and good corporate governance standards with what can be significant costs of compliance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill complements the Turnbull Government's financial sector and innovation policies such as tax incentives for angel investors in start-ups and announcements in this year's Budget including the Open Banking Review currently underway; the development of an enhanced regulatory sandbox for new and innovative financial services; and changes to the tax treatment of digital currencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has consulted at length on this extension of this policy to proprietary companies, releasing a consultation paper in 2015 followed by industry roundtables in 2016. The Government also released the draft legislation for public consultation in May 2017. Submissions expressed widespread support for the extension of the crowd-sourced equity funding framework to proprietary companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to thank all of the stakeholders who participated in these consultations over the past two years. It is important that the regulatory framework for crowd-sourced equity funding for proprietary companies operates effectively to maximise the benefit to businesses, intermediaries and investors. Stakeholder feedback has assisted with the development of a framework that achieves this.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill removes the regulatory barriers preventing eligible proprietary companies from accessing the crowd‑sourced equity funding framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure proprietary companies can effectively access the framework without breaching the 50 shareholder cap that currently applies to proprietary companies, investors who acquire shares through crowdfunding offers will not be counted towards the cap. Subsequent transfers by crowdfunding investors who on‑sell their shares will also be exempt if the company is not listed on a financial market. This will give crowdfunding investors flexibility to exit their investment without causing the company to inadvertently breach the shareholder cap and forcing it to convert to public company type. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Government is very proud of the flexibility it has built into the regime. Proprietary companies with shareholders who acquire shares through a crowdfunding offer will not be subject to the takeovers rules. For founders contemplating crowd-sourced equity funding, this will give them certainty that they can crowdfund and still seek further funding to grow the business without contravening the costly and complex takeovers provisions. To ensure investors are protected, the Bill includes a regulation making power to allow the Government to respond quickly by imposing additional conditions on this exemption if required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Acknowledging that proprietary companies that access crowd-sourced equity funding will no longer be closely held, these companies will be required to comply with additional obligations to protect investors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Proprietary companies with crowdfunding shareholders will be required to prepare financial reports in accordance with accounting standards, with financial statements to be audited once the company raises at least $3 million from crowdfunding offers. Financial transparency will allow investors to monitor progress of companies and make informed decisions about their investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Crowdfunding proprietary companies will be required to have a minimum of two directors, rather than the usual one director. This will provide greater transparency and certainty around succession planning. As proprietary companies that use crowdfunding will rely on public funding, the restrictions on related party transactions under Part 2E of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Act 2001</span> will be extended to crowdfunding proprietary companies to ensure that individual investors have appropriate protections against the risk of fraud and bias arising from transactions with related parties. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Bill enables proprietary companies to access crowd-sourced equity funding, the Bill also removes the temporary concessions from certain public company reporting and governance obligations that were included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding) Act 2017</span>. These concessions will be grandfathered for companies that register as or convert to public company status prior to the commencement of the extension of the framework to proprietary companies. However, to ensure consistency for those public companies eligible for the grandfathered concessions, the Bill increases the audit threshold for eligible public companies from $1 million to $3 million. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill further improves the overall crowd-sourced equity funding framework by reducing the withdrawal period after a company issues a supplementary or replacement offer document from one month to 14 days. A 14 day withdrawal period still gives investors adequate time to reconsider their investment, while providing greater certainty about the outcome of the offer for other potential investors and the company.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The extension of the crowd-sourced equity funding framework to proprietary companies will take effect six months from the date the Bill receives Royal Assent. The changes to the crowd-sourced equity funding framework for public companies, excluding the removal of the corporate governance concessions, will commence on Royal Assent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This requires a new, nationally consistent approach to quality and safeguards for the disability sector that ensure the NDIS supports and services are of an appropriate standard and are delivered in a way that promotes choice, control, dignity, and upholds basic human rights. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2016, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) endorsed the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework, setting out a new approach to regulation for the NDIS to protect NDIS participants.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recent inquiries and reports have documented the weaknesses of the current safeguards arrangements for disability services, and found that reports of abuse and neglect perpetrated against people with disability may not be pursued for a variety of reasons. This includes difficulties experienced in securing a conviction where the victim is a person with disability, and the challenges faced by people with disability who are victims of crime. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, governments have agreed that it is appropriate to consider a person's full criminal history, including spent, quashed and pardoned conviction information, to assess the risk they may pose in working with a person with disability in the NDIS.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last year the Australian Government announced the most significant reform to Australia's intelligence and security landscape in decades by establishing a new Home Affairs portfolio, creating an Office of National Intelligence (subsuming the existing Office of National Assessments), and transforming the Australian Signals Directorate into a statutory agency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small"> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill</span> 2018 implements the recommendations of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review and fulfils the Government's commitment to establish the Australian Signals Directorate as an independent statutory agency within the Defence portfolio reporting directly to the Minister for Defence. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 November 2016, the Prime Minister announced an independent review of the Australian Intelligence Community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The timing of the review is consistent with the 2011 Independent Review of the Intelligence Community recommendation that periodic review occur every five years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Review made 23 recommendations in relation to the structural, legislation and oversight architecture of the intelligence community, including the establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate as an independent statutory agency within the Defence portfolio. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Signals Directorate has a long history which goes back to the Second World War, when Australian Navy, Army and Air Force personnel were brought together to support General MacArthur's South‑West Pacific campaign by intercepting and decoding enemy radio signals.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After the war, as the wartime signals intelligence units were wound down, Government approval for a new peacetime signals intelligence organisation was given on 23 July 1946. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new Defence Signals Bureau opened at Albert Park Barracks, Melbourne, on 12 November 1947. Its role was to exploit foreign communications and be responsible for communications security in the armed services and Government departments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bureau was renamed the Defence Signals Branch in October 1949, a title it retained until January 1964, when it became the Defence Signals Division. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of an inquiry in 1977 into intelligence and security, the Defence Signals Division was renamed the Defence Signals Directorate and made directly responsible to the Secretary of the Department of Defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In June 1988, the Government decided that the Defence Signals Directorate should move to Defence headquarters at Russell Offices, Canberra, to facilitate a closer relationship with Defence, other intelligence agencies and key Government departments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recent years have seen a dramatic expansion of the information security role the Signals Directorate plays as a result of the explosive growth of the internet and moves to online service delivery by Australian Governments. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In January 2010, the Defence Signals Directorate established the Cyber Security Operations Centre to develop a comprehensive understanding of ICT security threats to critical Australian systems and coordinate a response to those threats across Government and industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2013, the Defence Signals Directorate was renamed the Australian Signals Directorate to reflect its whole-of-government role in support of Australia's national security.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In November 2014, the Cyber Security Operations Centre evolved into the Australian Cyber Security Centre, or the ACSC, which is the next evolution of Australia's cyber security capability. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACSC sees the co-location of all contributing agencies' cyber security capabilities, including the Australian Signals Directorate's cyber security mission, the Centre of Emergency Response Team from the Attorney-General's Department, representatives of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, ASIO, and the Defence Intelligence Organisation.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear the Australian Signals Directorate has evolved from a primarily Defence signals collection agency after World War II to become Australia's national signals intelligence authority for collecting intelligence, supporting the military and undertaking cyber security, and affects operations through the application of advanced technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Signals Directorate is now a national asset with a national focus, playing a much broader role than defined by its previously exclusive Defence focus. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In broad terms, this Bill will separate the Australian Signals Directorate from the Department of Defence and establish it as an independent statutory agency under the control of the Director-General of the Australian Signals Directorate from 1 July 2018. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2017, The Prime Minister announced the appointment of Mr Mike Burgess as the Director-General designate of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Burgess is a cyber security consultant who was previously the Chief Information Security Officer for Telstra and prior to that, a Deputy Director of the Australian Signals Directorate. Mr Burgess will bring to the Australian Signals Directorate significant experience in intelligence and information and cyber security from both the private and public sectors, particularly as it transitions to a statutory agency within the Defence portfolio. I congratulate him on his appointment and look forward to his ongoing contributions to our national security.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also amend the Australian Signals Directorate's functions to bring the ACSC into the Australian Signals Directorate, in accordance with recommendation 3(b) of the Review. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the employment of staff, the Australian Signals Directorate would operate outside of the Public Service Act framework. This will provide the Australian Signals Directorate with greater flexibility to recognise the skills of its specialised workforce. This structure will reflect the need to retain those individuals with highly sought after skills, such as those with science, technology, engineering and maths qualifications. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Signals Directorate will be required under the Bill to adopt the principles of the Public Service Act in relation to employees of the Australian Signals Directorate to the extent the Director-General of the Australian Signals Directorate considers they are consistent with the effective performance of the functions of the Australian Signals Directorate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also includes an additional function for the Australian Signals Directorate to protect the specialised technologies and capabilities acquired in the performance of its other functions. The Australian Signals Directorate cannot perform its important functions without being able to protect its tools to ensure their ongoing utility and protect Australia's national interests. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also includes provisions to amend the Crimes Act to include the Australian Signals Directorate in the assumed identities regime set out in Part IAC of the Crimes Act. This Part provides for the acquisition and use of assumed identities by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This allows authorised officers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to act under false identities, enabling them to undertake obscure sensitive activities that would be undermined if they were to be connected with law enforcement or intelligence agencies and protects the true identity of individual officers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, ASIS and ASIO operate assumed identities on the Australian Signals Directorate's behalf. The inclusion of the Australian Signals Directorate in the assumed identities scheme will increase transparency and accountability for the Australian Signals Directorate officers using assumed identities. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Director-General of the Australian Signals Directorate will be able to authorise the use of an assumed identity, the acquisition of evidence of an assumed identity will be authorised and done on the Australian Signals Directorate's behalf by either ASIO or ASIS. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate as a statutory authority puts the agency on a similar footing to ASIS and ASIO as a national security and intelligence asset. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the Australian Signals Directorate's increased national responsibilities in relation to cyber security and the critical operational support it provides to the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Signals Directorate will now have the appropriate statutory functions to ensure it is well placed to support Australian Defence Force operations and its national responsibility for combating cyber-crime, including the provision of advice to the private sector into the future. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The publication of detailed sanction information will deter businesses from breaching their obligations.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Simplifying Student Payments Act</span> supported regional and remote students by amending the rules governing when a person will be regarded as independent for the purposes of Youth Allowance. It intended to reduce the period young people from regional and remote areas of Australia have to earn the amount required to satisfy the workforce independence provisions from 18 months to 14 months. This measure commenced from 1 January 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reduction to 14 months was an election commitment by the Government and part of a package to support regional students' access to education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> Students whose family home is in a regional or remote location can access Youth Allowance on the basis of being independent under concessional workforce participation arrangements. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One way in which students can demonstrate they have supported themselves is through a period or periods of employment over 14 months since leaving secondary school, with earnings totalling at least 75 per cent of Wage Level A of the National Training Wage. This is $24,836 for the 2017-18 financial year.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, to access these arrangements students' parental income must be below $150,000, they must be undertaking full-time study and they must be required to live away from home to study.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure recognised that regional and remote students face additional costs in pursuing tertiary education and have much lower participation rates in higher education than students from major cities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reduced period from 18 months to 14 months allows students to qualify for Youth Allowance four months sooner than under previous arrangements. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Students are now able to take a gap year at the end of secondary school, and subject to them satisfying the other qualification requirements for Youth Allowance, receive payment as independent the following year. Students who are considered independent for Youth Allowance purposes do not have their rate of payment affected by parental income, as is the case for dependent recipients. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Previously, students who qualified for Youth Allowance under these arrangements may have commenced study prior to qualifying for student payments or have taken two gap years in order to satisfy the 18-month criteria before commencing study and qualifying for payment. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is estimated that over the forward estimates approximately 3,700 regional and remote students will qualify for Youth Allowance as independent under the 14-month period. Approximately 2,500 would become eligible for payment as independent four months earlier than under the previous 18-month period. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Approximately 1,200 would become eligible for payment as independent, who otherwise would not have met the independence criteria. This includes students who choose to take a gap year, who may have not undertaken a gap year otherwise. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These young people are expected to change their employment and study patterns in order to earn the required amount in 14 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite this measure commencing on 1 January 2018, an unintended consequence of the Act meant that a small group of approximately 300 students have not been able to take advantage of the reduced 14-month period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Young people who were receiving Youth Allowance prior to 1 January 2018 were unintentionally left behind. This group remained under the old 18-month rule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, a young person who finished school in 2016 and worked throughout 2017 hoping to qualify as independent and went on Youth Allowance as a dependent recipient, would have the 18-month period apply to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a young person from a regional area, who requires the full rate of Youth Allowance in order to move away from home to study, having the 18-month period apply to them could mean that they have to delay university for an extra year. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> This Bill will correct the unintended consequence of the Act and will mean that the 14-month period is available for all students seeking independence for Youth Allowance under the workforce independence provisions for regional and remote tertiary students.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When superannuation funds merge, assets need to be transferred to the new merged fund. When these assets are transferred, tax liabilities could arise which would reduce the balances of superannuation members. </span>

It also allows the transfer of valuable tax losses made in previous years, which would otherwise be lost when funds merged. This tax relief has been in place since December 2008 and was due to lapse in July 2017. Extending the tax relief will ensure that tax isn't an impediment to superannuation funds merging where the mergers are otherwise in the best interests of members.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill reforms the penalty and offence framework in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Excise Act 1901</span> (Excise Act) to more effectively combat the illicit tobacco market. With this Bill the Government is delivering on its 2016-17 Budget commitment to address the growing risk of illicit tobacco and criminal activity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through effective tobacco control policy, Australia has become a world leader in reducing smoking rates. This has improved the health and well-being of Australians and reduced the social costs associated with smoking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To continue reducing the prevalence of smoking, and to ensure tobacco products are taxed correctly, it is important to support these tobacco control policies with effective tobacco offences that combat the illicit tobacco market. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill improves the enforcement of illicit tobacco offences by providing officers with access to tiered offences and strengthened penalties. Introducing tiered offences will give prosecutors more flexibility to bring charges against persons who have committed an illicit tobacco offence. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also confirms that tobacco offences apply when the origin of the illicit tobacco cannot be established. This addresses an issue where uncertainty about whether illicit tobacco had been produced domestically or imported, has created a barrier to effective enforcement due to the requirement to determine which of the Excise Act or Customs Act was applicable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By providing enforcement agencies appropriate powers and the threat of significant penalties, the Government will be able to more effectively stamp out the illicit tobacco market. This will improve the health of Australians by reducing their exposure to tobacco products. It will ensure that tobacco products consumed domestically are fully taxed and comply with Australian regulations including safety standards.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill enacts the Government's budget announcement to reform the way that the Commonwealth makes housing related payments to the States and Territories. It supports improved housing and homelessness outcomes by requiring jurisdictions to develop detailed housing and homelessness strategies and commit to improved data collection and reporting in exchange for Commonwealth funding. This approach will secure improved outcomes but in a way the Government believes is reasonable, that is achievable for the States and Territories and does not jeopardise the funding of core social housing and homelessness services. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of this housing affordability plan, the Government announced that it would be working with State and Territory governments to introduce a new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to replace the NAHA. Since then, the Government has engaged in a series of productive discussions with all States and Territories.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite contributing over $9 billion to States and Territories since 2009 to support the provision of social and affordable housing, the Council of Australian Governments' 2016 Report on Performance found that the current NAHA has completely failed to deliver on three of its four key benchmarks and is unlikely to meet them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement will replace the NAHA and the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. It will not only maintain the current level of funding under these Agreements but will also, for the first time, ensure that funding allocated to homelessness services will be permanent and indexed. Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2021, this equates to total funding of around $4.6 billion, including $375.3 million of new funding for homelessness that will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the States and Territories.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement will ensure that each State or Territory acknowledges and addresses the challenges specific to their jurisdiction through comprehensive housing and homelessness strategies. It will contribute to the development of a comprehensive evidence base through improved collection and reporting of housing and homelessness related data. It will secure ongoing and indexed funding for homelessness services, and ensure that States and Territories match the Commonwealth's funding contribution for homelessness services dollar-for-dollar. Under this new Agreement, all we ask of the States and Territories is that they set out how they intend to implement their housing and homelessness strategies and assist the Commonwealth to improve the collection and reporting of relevant housing data. </span>

These bills seek authority from the parliament to top up the annual appropriations provided at budget time to meet the net costs of estimates variations and policy initiatives announced since that time. Details of these bills were examined in the usual way at Senate additional estimates hearings held in late February and early March 2018. I would like to thank the Senate, and in particular the opposition, for working constructively with the government to ensure the passage of this bill before the reporting date from the committee on this occasion. We acknowledge that this does not set a precedent for the passage of future bills. With those few words, I commend the bill.</span>

In particular, funds argued not to relate to ordinary annual services of the government have been included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017‑2018. However, as this is otherwise a bill appropriating moneys for the ordinary annual services, and section 53 of the Constitution precludes the Senate amending such a bill, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate for the amendments to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017‑2018 to be moved as requests.</span>

They should not contain new initiatives, but they do. Those initiatives should be taken out and put into a bill which can be amended by the Senate. That's simply the purpose of it. The government is not acting in accordance with the Constitution and it should be.</span>

His amendments are of course framed as a request because the Senate does not have the constitutional power to amend a bill that appropriates money for the ordinary annual services of the government. The government will not support this request and will not agree to any amendments in the House. The classification of expenditure between appropriation bills nos. 3 and 4 is fully consistent with the Senate executive compact. The compact confirms what can be considered to be ordinary annual services of government for the purposes of section 54 of the Constitution. The Senate executive compact has not changed since its last update in 1999, when it was agreed to by both the Senate and the government. Over the last 19 years, the compact has been applied in the same way by successive governments of different political persuasions and so we don't accept the premise of Senator Leyonhjelm's argument.</span>

This issue goes to the classification of appropriation items that constitute the ordinary annual services of government, which was worked through in 1965 in the form of a Senate executive compact. In 1999, it was agreed that new administered expenses that fell within an existing outcome would be included in Appropriation Bill No. 1 and therefore, by implication, be considered the ordinary annual services of government. Appropriation bills have been prepared according to this principle since 1999, and outcome structures are the basis and the point of appropriations. Therefore, new policies that sit within them can be funded from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 3). For that principled reason and policy reason, Labor will not be supporting these amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I have moved amendments to three schedules within the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. Amendments to two of these schedules, 6 and 10, will just postpone their start dates. These schedules relate to closing widow allowance for new entrants and ensuring that new claimants of unemployment payments connect more quickly with employment services. Amendments to the start dates for these measures are necessary due to the bill not passing before the planned 1 January 2018 commencement date.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have moved amendments to schedule 15, which relates to the targeted compliance framework. The amendments would prevent ParentsNext participants from receiving four-week penalties for refusing to accept or voluntarily leaving work. While these penalties are appropriate when looking for work as a condition of receiving income support, ParentsNext participants are not required to look for work as a condition of receiving payment. This is because ParentsNext is a pre-employment program rather than an employment program. It connects parents of young children to services in their local community and helps them plan and prepare for employment by the time their children start school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments also address an unintended consequence of schedule 15 of the bill, identified through the implementation design process. The new compliance framework will always apply for noncompliance with mutual obligation requirements, including failure to attend an appointment with a provider noted under section 63 of the Social Security (Administration) Act. However, this section is also used by Centrelink to notify income support claimants and recipients of broader administrative requirements, such as providing documents to Centrelink, and should be dealt with through other mechanisms, rather than the compliance framework. This amendment will allow the most appropriate response to be used, depending on the nature of the failure.</span>

That being said, we consider them as only very, very minor improvements to the regressive things that are in schedule 15. We are moving our own amendments to schedule 15 which we hope will be successful. Indeed, if they're not successful, we will vote against schedule 15 as a whole. Therefore, I will now speak to our alternative amendments to schedule 15 so that the chamber can consider those and I will also highlight some of the issues with schedule 15.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very much seeking to reinstate waivers and the discretion for the departmental secretary and employment service providers when assessing demerits and financial penalties. We note that the schedule as a whole changes the compliance framework for income support recipients to mutual obligations and participation payments. We also note that, as a two-phase framework, the first phase attributes demerit points to jobseekers who fail to comply with their obligations. If a jobseeker accrues up to four demerit points within six months, the government is seeking to assess them and put them into an intensive phase. In the intensive phase, there are three escalating penalties or strikes. For the first strike the recipient loses a week's payment; for the second strike, they lose two weeks; and, for the third strike, there is a cancellation of that payment and a four-week exclusion from re-application.</span>

Under the current system, we see 72,000 financial penalties applied each year. Can you highlight for the chamber what, under the proposed system, that will be?</span>

This results in inconsistent and unfair application of penalties. The National Social Security Rights Network acknowledged this in its evidence at the Senate committee hearing, stating that the new framework:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new compliance framework, providers will still exercise discretion as to whether or not they find the excuse offered by the jobseeker to be acceptable, in which case no financial penalty or demerit will be applied. The appointment will just be rebooked, as currently occurs. However, they will be unable to ignore blatant noncompliance with no excuse. DHS will also retain the discretion they currently have in relation to all decisions about applying financial penalties.</span>

So you're expecting, then, over half to go to a two-week exclusion and then half of them again. Yes, sorry; I take your point. While I'm on my feet, I will, first off, very clearly remind people where we're up to: the Greens oppose this bill. We think that there are many schedules in this bill that will have a detrimental impact on people struggling on income support. Having said that, we think this series of amendments makes things slightly better. So if the will of the Senate is not what the Greens want—in other words, the bill is supported—these amendments will make the provision slightly better, so we will be supporting these amendments.</span>

Unfortunately, we've had a period of time now—I think it's four weeks—since we were debating this last time, and we did, I know, go over some questions. I will try not to repeat those, but I do have some more questions on the issues here which I think are probably better addressed when I go to my amendments.</span>

However, NXT also wants to ensure that persons not engaging in the jobactive system are continually communicated with and given every possible chance, including a final chance, to engage with the system before losing payments. Will the minister detail how Newstart or youth allowance recipients will be provided with one further chance to engage with the system once all demerit points are exhausted?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this amendment the current intent-to-claim provisions will be retained so as to only apply to claimants who are in vulnerable circumstances. The amendment includes an instrument-making power to allow a legislative instrument to define a vulnerable claimant for the purposes of the intent-to-claim provisions. For all other claimants the date of the claim will be the date the claim is lodged rather than the date they initially contact the department. Vulnerable claimants will be those who have a genuine difficulty in collating their documentation. These difficulties will include but not be limited to being homeless, affected by a major disaster or family and domestic violence, a recent humanitarian entrant or recently released from prison or psychiatric confinement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (1) omits schedule 11, 'Removal of intent to claim provisions', and substitutes new schedule 11, 'Intent to claim provisions'. New schedule 11 retains and amends the current intent-to-claim provisions in the social security law. As I've stated, these provisions will now apply to a person in vulnerable circumstances, being a person who is included in the class of persons determined by the minister in a legislative instrument—and I've outline examples of that. This amendment will also remove the requirement for the secretary to give a person a written notice acknowledging the Department of Human Services has been contacted in relation to the making of a claim for a social security payment or concession card.</span>

We note that your circulated EM shows that the class of people could include people experiencing homelessness, people experiencing domestic violence and humanitarian entrants. So we can see that the government's made some efforts in this regard, but we very firmly believe that these amendments do not go far enough in fixing the problems in schedule 11, so we oppose the amendments and continue to oppose schedule 11.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  The Greens, as I've articulated, don't support these amendments and don't support the bill or this schedule. We have deep concern that it will impact on vulnerable people, of course, but, more broadly, on people who are on income support or trying to access income support, as I articulated in my second reading contribution. The supplementary EM to these amendments says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, it is acknowledged that there may be occasions when a person in vulnerable circumstances may not be able to lodge a claim or provide the required documentation in a timely manner. Accordingly, although the deemed claim provisions will no longer apply to claimants generally, these amendments will ensure that sections 13 and 14 will continue to apply to a vulnerable claimant, being a person included in a class of persons determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is by legislative instrument; it's not something that we get to comment on in this place other than, potentially, by voting yes or no. I'm deeply concerned that it won't include the sorts of vulnerable people that I support and hear from on a regular basis in my office. For example, Aboriginal people living in a remote community may not be able to access their documentation or it may take weeks and weeks to get their documentation, as we heard about in the Northern Territory when we were up there for the CDP inquiry last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment goes some way, but it does not address the broader issues created by this schedule, where we think a lot of Australians won't get access to income support when they need it. I remember being here when we were debating the provisions around people needing to access income support urgently and the further impositions that this government put on people having to prove that they're fleeing family crisis situations and family violence. When we were debating that, it was very clear that the hurdle had gone much higher. I'm concerned that this is a continued approach by government to keep ratcheting up that hurdle so that social security, which is a right, is being made harder and harder to access. These amendments don't address those fundamental issues that are raised by this schedule. So we will be opposing these amendments and, as people know, we oppose this schedule.</span>

With the advent of technology that allows people to gather and submit documentation quickly and easily, this level of assistance is no longer necessary or appropriate. These provisions allowed leniency for claimants by effectively backdating their entitlement to payment to the date they initially contacted the Department of Human Services and indicated their intention to claim. The purpose of removing these provisions is to encourage claimants to take greater personal responsibility for understanding their payment entitlements and to submit claims in a timely fashion. But, as I have already stated, there are protections that will apply to vulnerable claimants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Claimants in vulnerable circumstances who have a genuine difficulty in providing documents with the claim will be able to complete the claim and provide the required documents after completing and lodging the claim. I've gone through the examples of vulnerable circumstances. They include crisis situations where the claimant is homeless, affected by a major disaster, affected by family and domestic violence, is a recent humanitarian entrant to Australia or has recently been released from prison or psychiatric confinement. Vulnerable circumstances may also relate to situations where the claimant is a younger person applying on the basis that it is unreasonable to live at home, is caring for someone with a terminal illness, is aged under 18 and in the care of another person, is blind, has a partner with a residential aged-care assessment or an assessment is in progress or has a partner and they are illness separated. DHS will be able to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a claimant is in vulnerable circumstances and unable to provide documents with the claim.</span>

For example, there are people who have to access identity documents from overseas or take time drilling down their Australian citizenship documentation. If you become unexpectedly unemployed and you're not used to accessing this documentation, it may take you some weeks to gather that documentation before you're able to apply.</span>

Very often they don't have passports; they don't have up-to-date photos. There's been a whole range of issues raised over the years. When you said 'the documentation', did you mean that giving the application itself to the agent will count?</span>

I'm not exactly sure we're on the same page, so if I provide you with some information hopefully you can then tell me whether or not we are both on the same page. For example, what will happen to claimants that are waiting for documentation from a third party? All claimants also have additional time—up to 14 days—to supply some third-party documents from the time they lodge their claims. Examples of these documents include medical reports when applying for disability support pension or evidence of parental income when applying for youth allowance. In relation to documents or information generally considered to be outside a claimant's control, these could be obtaining medical evidence through a report to be completed by a treating doctor or specialist, business or private trust details, or parental income. Documents or information generally considered to be within a claimant's control include: tax file number, savings account balances, employment separation certificates or proof of identity.</span>

That's where I think the confusion was. When you said 'documents' and the point they are given to the agent, I was still talking about the issues around the applications because I thought we had established the date for the application is when the agent sends it to the Department of Human Services or when the department gets it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 provides for the cessation of the wife pension. This is not something that Labor support. We note that, of the 7,750 recipients, there are many who would transfer under this provision to the age pension and the carers payment and would be no worse off. Indeed, it makes sense to simplify payments. But I have to say that we are not prepared to see many other vulnerable women on the wife pension go backwards in their access to income support. There are 3,100 women who will be worse off and 2,900 women transferring onto a jobseeker payment. This is not a new area of social security; this has been closed to new applicants since 1995. So you have 2,900 women who will have been out of the workforce for more than 20 years who will be transferred onto a jobseeker payment. This is a pretty extraordinary thing to do to women who have had very little, if any, exposure to the workforce.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also very concerned about the 200 women living overseas who will no longer be able to access any income support other than the support that their spouse is eligible for. We can see that, overnight, they would be $670 worse off a fortnight. This is an incredibly perilous situation to put them into. We have here a group of low-income women who will be left with nothing to live on other than their partner's pension, many of them having been out of the workforce for a great many years. As I said before, they will have been receiving the wife pension for a minimum of 22 years.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems reasonable to us, in the opposition, that this group of women should be grandfathered, to avoid them facing such a significant financial crisis, the kind of crisis that comes with not only deep economic cost but also a great sense of personal distress. There are a reasonably small number of women affected; therefore, there would be a reasonably minimal cost of grandfathering them. It is indeed a cruel and unnecessary cut. In moving these amendments, I ask the government: when putting this schedule 3 forward, did you consider grandfathering the 200 low-income women who will be forced to live on nothing from 20 March 2020, and what would that have cost?</span>

I acknowledge Labor's support for the schedules that establish the new jobseeker payment, which will be the main working-age payment, and their support for the schedules that streamline the Department of Human Services' collection of tax file numbers and the alignment of social security and disability discrimination law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does not support the amendments proposed by the opposition, moved by Senator Pratt. The government has paid attention to the views of interested parties and the opposition and has proposed and supported a range of amendments to this bill in both the House and the Senate which will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the welfare system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the cessation of the wife pension and the bereavement allowance, schedules 3 and 4, the government does not support the amendments proposed by Labor to schedules 3 and 4 which would have the effect of continuing the wife pension and the bereavement allowance into the future. Ceasing these payments is an important part of building a simpler system that provides more encouragement and support for people transitioning to work. The amendment proposed by the government will provide an additional payment to newly bereaved pregnant women, to ensure that no bereaved pregnant women will be disadvantaged by the cessation of the bereavement allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the amendments to schedule 9, it is disappointing that Labor is not supporting schedule 9, which is designed to increase the chances of older unemployed people finding work. A recent OECD report found there is an unmet activation potential in Australia's labour market and recommended increasing participation requirements for several cohorts, including older Australians. Unemployed people aged 55 to 59 have many productive years ahead of them. This measure, complemented by new and existing assistance, will help mature-age jobseekers gain skills and find work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to schedule 10, it is again disappointing that Labor is not supporting this schedule, which changes the start date for some participation payments. We know that more than one-third of jobseekers take longer than two days to connect with their jobactive or Transition to Work provider. This measure is all about ensuring that jobseekers are connecting as quickly as they can to the services that are there to help them find a job and move off welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to schedules 12 to 14, the bill also includes important measures that will better encourage jobseekers with substance abuse issues to pursue treatment to address their issues so that they can find work and ultimately become self-reliant. The changes to reasonable excuse provisions are needed because it is not consistent with community expectations that jobseekers are able to repeatedly avoid their requirements due to drug and alcohol misuse while refusing to participate in treatment, despite being able to. The changes to exemptions for mutual obligation requirements will also support jobseekers with substance abuse issues to remain connected to their employment services provider and engage in suitable activities to address their barriers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor amendments to remove these changes to reasonable excuse and exemptions would simply ensure that vulnerable jobseekers with substance abuse issues are left alone to struggle with their substance abuse, rather than being supported to overcome their issues. While the government is amending the bill to remove the drug-testing trial, the government remains committed to this measure and believes that randomised drug testing can be an effective way of identifying welfare recipients for whom mandated treatment could be successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to schedule 15, the targeted compliance framework, the Labor amendment introducing broader discretion to the targeted compliance framework would retain one of the ineffective features of the current compliance framework which allow providers to effectively ignore noncompliance, even where the jobseeker has no reasonable excuse. This results in inconsistent and unfair application of penalties. The National Social Security Rights Network acknowledged this in its evidence at the Senate committee hearing, stating that the new framework deals with a range of problems in the existing system. They include an arbitrary levelling of penalties, depending on provider discretion. Under the new compliance framework, providers will still exercise discretion as to whether or not they find the excuse offered by the jobseeker to be acceptable, in which case no financial penalty or demerit will be applied. The appointment will just be rebooked, as currently occurs. However, they will be unable to ignore blatant noncompliance with no excuse. DHS will also retain the discretion they currently have in relation to all decisions about applying financial penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to schedule 17, 'Information management', the opposition's amendment would also remove the ability to streamline the process of referrals for welfare fraud prosecution, which is central to combating welfare fraud and maintaining the integrity of the social security system. On that basis, the government will not be supporting any of the Labor amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Pratt, in relation to your question concerning the cessation of the wife pension, you may be aware that Senator Cameron and I discussed this at the last hearing of this bill in December of last year. In relation to the questions that you've asked, I am advised that, no—the government did not consider grandfathering these women and has not costed grandfathering them, as it would create additional complexity, which would be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill. Most wife pension recipients living overseas will experience an estimated average loss of $457.10 per fortnight, as the majority of these women currently receive a part-rate of payment due to insufficient Australian working-life residency and/or income and assets. These recipients have access to other income sources besides their wife pension payments, such as foreign pensions and investment income.</span>

Those transferring to the jobseeker payment will have their payment rate frozen until the jobseeker payment rate equals or exceeds it. Most wife pension recipients will receive an average of $457.10 per fortnight compared to $669.60, the maximum rate, as they receive a part rate of payment due to insufficient Australian working life residency and/or income and assets.</span>

In areas of high unemployment and low expectation of older jobseekers finding employment, I understand that jobactive providers have the discretion to reduce job activity requirements for Newstart participants. Can the minister advise how this information will be conveyed to relevant Newstart recipients? For example, will the information be clear and available on the MyGov or Centrelink websites advising recipients they can seek to have their job activity or volunteering ratios changed in certain circumstances?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  In speaking to the chamber about the amendments that we have put forward and in seeking also to ask the government some further questions, I want to highlight to the chamber what our amendments do. We are proposing to oppose the cessation of the wife pension in schedule 3, oppose the cessation of the bereavement allowance in schedule 4, and oppose changes to the activity test for 55- to 59-year-olds in schedule 9 as well as changes to the start date for some participation payments in schedule 10 and removal of the intention to claim in schedule 11.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's removed the drug-testing trial. We also are seeking the removal of exemptions due to drug or alcohol dependency in schedule 13 and changes to reasonable excuse and information management in schedule 14. As I started discussing earlier in the evening, we are looking to amend schedule 15 so that there is further discretion to the targeted compliance work in schedule 15. Why are we moving necessary amendments? Well, as I have highlighted, we are particularly concerned about the cessation of bereavement allowance in schedule 4. We believe it's a cruel and unnecessary cut for people who are facing perhaps the most difficult and worst circumstances in their lives. We know that the allowance is a short-term payment for a person whose partner has died. It's paid for a maximum of 14 weeks at the rate of the age pension. So putting a person on a jobseeker payment is a very cruel thing to do, and I do not understand the logic of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand and, indeed, we haven't opposed the idea that payments could be streamlined, combined and put together. But the idea that people in bereavement are jobseekers is a complete nonsense. You could, for example, be a casual employee who actively works all of the time but doesn't have access to any kind of leave payments. You're quite able to go back to work after your period of bereavement, but you still actually require income support for that time of bereavement, so it is a nonsense to put someone on a jobseeker payment. They should be entitled to a proper bereavement payment in lieu of income that they would otherwise have had.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extraordinary to me that the government would seek to do this, for example, to a pregnant woman who had a working spouse who died. She, too, is put on a jobseeker payment when there really is no expectation that she will be able to find work during the course of her pregnancy. It seems extraordinary to me that this is what the government is seeking to do. It is unbelievable that someone would be put in this situation, so I want to ask the government what its rationale is for cutting short-term income support to people who have lost their partners. I can see this only as a cash grab to reduce people's entitlements and people's payments. I understand you want to streamline jobseeker payments, and we're not averse to that, but the idea that people in bereavement should be categorised as jobseekers when essentially they are not—it is a period of bereavement that they're seeking payment for—is extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to highlight the start day for participation payments in schedule 10. Again, we're opposed to this schedule. We know that, at the moment, a person can receive payment from the date they make their claim or from the first day after the end of any waiting period that they have to serve. But what the government is seeking to do here is to punish people further by pushing the start date back to when the person first has their interview with their job service provider. Now, again, I can see this only as a cash grab by government at the expense of low-income Australians who may have lost employment and need to work through issues in their life so that they can, indeed, go to their jobactive job service provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what you're seeking to do here is cut $198 million over the forward estimates. It means that people will need to wait longer for income support at a time when they're trying to find employment. Now, I know the government has said it wants to get people connected as soon as possible so that they can find a job. Well, the simple fact is that leaving people without income support does great detriment to their capacity to find work. Your appointment with your job service provider is but a very small piece of that puzzle. A primary and very important part of the puzzle is, frankly, being able to afford the bus fare to get to your job service provider. That is impossible if the start date for a person's participation payments is being pushed. So, again, we've got questions here about how long people will have to wait on average to receive income support as a result of this measure. What is the estimated upper limit and average wait time?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want to discuss with the government tonight the removal of schedule 13, which includes the exemptions for drug and alcohol dependence. This measure has been very firmly criticised by a range of providers who work with drug and alcohol dependent people. We're concerned about the way in which the schedule would prevent temporary exemptions being granted where the person's situation is wholly or predominantly attributable to drug or alcohol dependency or misuse. This includes any sickness, injury or special circumstances, such as eviction, associated with this misuse. We understand the significance of the concerns raised by health and welfare groups saying that the changes fail to recognise the incredibly complex nature of substance abuse as essentially a health condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes negate a doctor's medical opinion in advising that a jobseeker cannot meet their requirements for a temporary period. We're concerned that this relates not just to acute episodes of substance misuse but also to the secondary health problems associated with that use. For example, someone receiving treatment in hospital for cirrhosis of the liver associated with alcohol use will no longer be able to access a medically recommended temporary exemption, as far as we can tell from these measures. Someone injured while intoxicated would no longer be able to access a temporary exemption. Recipients would be expected to satisfy mutual obligation requirements. A jobseeker's obligation or plan would take into account the jobseeker engaging in drug or alcohol treatment. So what the government are effectively asking people to do here is engage in drug and alcohol treatment so their obligations can reflect those circumstances because, if they don't, they cannot use that as an excuse to meet the normal obligations of a jobseeker. We are concerned about the way in which this is going to push vulnerable people into crisis, homelessness and crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to highlight in schedule 13 the special categories of exemptions that may arise because we're opposed to these changes and are moving amendments to remove them. Income support recipients can receive an exemption from mutual obligation requirements if they're unable to meet them, but the current legislation's exemptions from the mutual obligation requirements can only be granted for a special period of up to 13 weeks. We have here the special categories of exemptions that may arise, including major disruption to the jobseeker's home or a major personal crisis, including homelessness. We're seeing changes that are proposed by the government in this bill that mean that, when jobseekers are unable to meet their obligations due to drug or alcohol dependency or due to crisis circumstances that are related to that dependency, they will no longer be able to receive an exemption. This is an extraordinary thing to do to people, whether it's because of substance abuse or because someone receives a significant injury as a result of alcohol misuse on a Saturday night that means they can't go to work and need to take six months off. These aren't necessarily people who are significantly drug and alcohol dependent. We know that this can be quite common behaviour on a Saturday night.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to highlight to the chamber this evening our concerns around schedule 14, which is included in the same group of our amendments. Jobseekers can be penalised for a range of participation failures currently—this we understand—including not turning up for an appointment with Centrelink. These penalties are not applied where the person has a reasonable excuse. Schedule 14 provides that a jobseeker who uses drug or alcohol dependence as an excuse for participation failure will be offered treatment. If they take up treatment, it will count towards their participation requirements, and, if they refuse it, their substance use disorder can cause them not to comply with jobseeker requirements a second time—and, indeed, you are putting forward that their payments will be suspended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very concerned, as experts are, that this does not in any way help people overcome addiction but instead will push them into crisis, poverty and homelessness. We see that the implementation of this schedule is expected to cost money over the forward estimates, but we are very concerned, frankly, about the money that will come out of the pockets of vulnerable people. As experts have warned, it is of no help to people overcoming addiction to remove their payments. Does the government believe this measure will increase homelessness or crime for people who have substance use issues? Why has the government ignored the advice of health experts?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've highlighted, I've got a range of questions for government on all of these different schedules, so I might just step back to schedule 10, where I raised our concerns about the start date for participant payments, and ask the government what their expectations are around how many people will have to wait longer to receive income support as a result of this measure and how long they will have to wait. What is the estimated upper limit and average wait time?</span>

These changes are designed to ensure jobseekers connect with employment services as quickly as possible and are accessing the programs that are available to help them find a job.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of why the changes themselves are actually needed, more than one-third of jobseekers take longer than two days to connect with their jobactive or Transition to Work provider, and almost 10 per cent take longer than five days to attend their initial appointment. These delays are inconsistent with community expectations that those on income support are making all reasonable efforts to connect with employment services and find work as quickly as possible.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also highlight, though, that there are safeguards that are being put in place. Jobactive and Transition to Work providers are contractually required to have appointments available for jobseekers to attend within two business days. Where there is no appointment available for a jobseeker to attend within two business days, their income support would generally commence from the date their claim was made.</span>

Jobseekers will no longer be able to be exempted from their mutual obligation or participation requirements where they have an illness or other circumstances affecting their ability to meet their mutual obligation requirements which is primarily attributable to drug or alcohol abuse. The measure reflects that people with substance abuse issues that prevent them from looking for work or undertaking other activities should be taking active steps to address their issues, including through appropriate treatment, rather than being exempt from the requirements.</span>

We're investing $28.8 million in this measure to provide employment services to those no longer eligible for an exemption. This will support these jobseekers with drug and alcohol abuse issues to remain actively engaged in appropriate activities to address their barriers to work. For the very first time, through a related measure, all jobseekers with substance misuse issues will be able to undertake appropriate treatment as part of their job plan to meet their mutual obligation requirements.</span>

But, in relation to the broader answer to your question, the alternative would be to use the primary legislation itself to specify the circumstances in which drug or alcohol dependency must or must not be taken into account. This would require the inclusion of an inappropriate level of detail in the primary legislation. Also, using a legislative instrument is preferable because it provides greater flexibility should any refinement to the policy be required. You'd also be aware that the instrument itself is disallowable, so this ensures appropriate parliamentary oversight through the disallowance process. This will ensure that the instrument does not include matters beyond the government's declared policy intent.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:13</span>):  The Greens will be supporting these amendments. These are in fact the same amendments that the Greens also have on the running sheet. In my second reading contribution, I made a contribution about all these issues, but that was some time ago now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 relates to the cessation of the wife pension. There's a deep concern around those women who are currently living overseas who are not anticipated to transition to an income support payment and should continue to receive a payment in line with schedule 2 of this bill. That's what we think should happen. That grandfathers widow B pension recipients from changes to the applicable portability rules. We don't see why that shouldn't apply to the women who are caught up by this provision. We think it basically shows the mean-spiritedness of the government but also just how keen they are to punish people who have to rely on income support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With schedule 4, I've also made clear the Greens position on bereavement allowance. And we believe that people are being disadvantaged by the change to 'job' made in bringing in the jobseeker payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On schedule 9, which relates to older working Australians, I will say that a number of organisations made comments to the Senate inquiry into this bill about the impact this particular measure would have on them. In fact, we got evidence about regional organisations and the impact it would have on volunteering in regional organisations. I accept that the government did make a few amendments. At the time, we did note that we thought that was a slight improvement. Nevertheless, a number of older Australians are going to be caught up here. And, particularly into the future, we know that a large number of those long-term income support recipients are those over the age of 45. I think I've said in this place before, while they say that the new 30 is 20, in fact, you go the other way; the new 45 is actually around 55 or 60, the way that older jobseekers are being treated in the job market. To think that you can be unable to get a job or be discriminated against when you're over the age of 45—that is in fact what's happening—let alone when you get to the age of 55. This is going to be a growing area, and I can hear the minister already saying, 'And that's why we need this.' No; in fact, that's why this will hurt more and more people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are deeply concerned about the impact of that schedule, just as we are deeply concerned about schedule 10, as I have articulated previously, and the start date for some participation payments. We have deep concern about the impact that will have. Again, it's a mean-spirited approach that's more about saving money than the welfare of income support recipients. We just had a discussion about schedule 11 and the removal of the 'intent to pay' provisions. Again, there were some changes made by the government. In fact, we don't support the replacement of the schedule with the amendments that the government brought in tonight. We still don't support this approach. We don't think it's the way we should be treating people who, as I said earlier, have a right to social security in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 13 and 14 relate to the government's obsession with demonising people who have addictions. Addictions are a health issue. They can't be dealt with through the income support system. We have heard endlessly from experts on addiction that you need to treat this as a health issue, and you can't tackle it through the income support system. This will hurt very vulnerable people who have an addiction. It is not the way that we should be treating people who have drug or alcohol dependency or, in fact, a crisis relating to it. And before I hear those opposite say, 'You're just being soft on those who have a drug or alcohol dependency, and you don't care,' yes, we do care, which is why we oppose these two schedules. They will hurt people, not help people, with drug and alcohol dependency. This is not the way to address it. We agree that we need to help people with a drug and alcohol dependency and addiction. Yes, we absolutely do. I'll say it again: we do care. We do need to help people who have drug and alcohol dependency and/or addiction, but this is not the way to do it, which is why we oppose schedules 13 and 14. They're related. Schedule 13 removes the temporary exemptions from mutual obligation requirements for income support recipients with drug and alcohol dependency. Schedule 14 relates to reasonable excuses. Again, this is not the way you address helping those with drug and alcohol dependency. It's a multifaceted problem, it is a health problem and we do need to address those underlying causes. This will very quickly see people with drug and alcohol addiction fall off income support. There's not a doubt in my mind that that's what will happen. What happens to those people who end up out of the system with no means of support? If they do have accommodation, they'll lose connection with that and become homeless, amongst a whole range of other issues. This is a health issue and should be treated as such.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have an amendment to oppose schedule 17 as it relates to information management. This schedule contains provisions which repeal the privilege against self-incrimination, subject to immunity, in relation to the use of information or documents. We believe this is a significant change and it should not be dealt with as part of this bill so we will be supporting the ALP amendments. While we have a large number of amendments to schedule 15, this amendment doesn't clash with our other amendments to schedule 15, and we indicate our support for that as well. They're the same as Greens amendments, so we will be supporting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These schedules will have significant impact on those that will be affected by them, and we don't think this is the way we should be treating income support recipients. We think there are alternative ways to deal with a number of issues the government has brought up. While we're not necessarily opposed to the overall creation of a jobseeker payment, we are deeply concerned with the measures to put that particular payment in place, which is why we oppose schedules 3 and 4 here. We oppose some of the other schedules, which I'll come to later, which are not included in this particular set of amendments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:22</span>):  Before the chair puts our amendments, I did just want to speak very briefly to schedule 9 of the bill—the one that relates to mutual obligation requirements for people aged 55 to 59. In doing so, I want to express my dismay at both versions—this current version and the previous version in schedule 9—that the government put forward. We know that people in this age bracket are currently required to do 30 hours of activity per fortnight to meet their mutual obligation requirements. Importantly, this requirement can be fulfilled by doing 30 hours of volunteering. I want to say in my own capacity as the shadow assistant minister for families and communities, who would therefore have responsibility for volunteering, how important this is, particularly the contribution of people in this age cohort. Of the volunteers in Australia, we have 278,000 or more who are aged 55 to 59. I want to commend Volunteering Australia for pursuing this issue relentlessly; indeed, they have secured some amendments. Nevertheless, we don't believe they go far enough. When you look at the dignity and self-worth that people get out of volunteering their time for that 30 hours a fortnight, it is of immense benefit to the community, and it's also immensely important, given the very tight employment market, for people in this age cohort. I think we saw something like one job for every six jobseekers in this kind of space, which means we really should be encouraging people into meaningful activity that supports the community, supports their wellbeing, supports their mental health and is not a futile quest for jobs that aren't there. Clearly, people can and should be able to seek work and receive all the support they need to do that, but it is simply unreasonable of the government to be putting aside the 30 hours of activity per fortnight in volunteering in order to split that so that people can do 15 hours volunteering and 15 hours looking for work. The simple fact is that will be too difficult for many people. They'll say, 'I'll have to quit my jobseeking, first and foremost,' and that will impact on their wellbeing as well as the community activities that won't be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the importance of the campaign and the work done by Volunteering Australia, but I simply put on the record tonight that we are still moving in our amendments to remove that schedule because we don't believe it goes far enough.</span>

On 2 February 2018, the Hon. Dan Tehan MP, Minister for Social Services, wrote to NXT and committed to funding of an additional $40 million to address addiction. After consultation with addiction specialists, NXT believes that a total of $20 million for additional funding over a three-year period for addiction should be made available for the exclusive purpose of supporting GPs and other relevant allied health professionals, such as nurse practitioners, mental health social workers and psychologists, in regional and remote Australia to access professional development and specialist skills in addiction medicine. Will the minister confirm that this funding will be available from July 2018 for a period of three years?</span>

                    </a>  If we are going to rely on convention in relation to these issues, there is one issue that should also be addressed at this time, and that is the concern that senators sought to pair on the floor of the chamber to address the problems associated with two senators not being present for this vote. I think the difficulty with the pairing conventions needs to be highlighted as well. You cannot seek a pair on the floor by virtue of a senator being absent through misadventure. We've heard some explanations. I'm not sure the misadventures on this occasion equate anywhere near the misadventures that I've heard about in my 20 years in this place, but we need to address the issue that pairing is not an option to deal with matters of this type.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is removing drug and alcohol abuse as an excuse for noncompliance with welfare rules. However, the government is allowing this excuse to continue for certain recipients of apprenticeship and student payments and for recipients of payments under the Community Development Program. The great majority of welfare recipients under the Community Development Program are Aboriginal, so the government is of the view that Aboriginal Australians, unlike other Australians, should be allowed to drink themselves to death while remaining on welfare. Why? Is alcohol and drug abuse good for Aborigines but bad for other Australians? Do Aborigines have an inalienable right to alcohol and drug abuse as a sacred natural tenet that other Australians do not? I think not. I think this is more about political correctness. Political correctness requires that welfare for Aborigines doesn't change until self-appointed Aboriginal leaders unanimously agree to changes. Those with expertise in living well, getting a job and becoming prosperous have no say and neither do taxpayers in general. Political correctness also requires that, when we see Aboriginal welfare recipients abusing drugs and alcohol, the appropriate response is hand-wringing and self-flagellation. In contrast, when we see other welfare recipients abusing drugs and alcohol, we can be clear-headed enough to consider responses that put obligations on the welfare recipients, rather than treat them all like hopeless cases. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's exception that allows Aboriginal welfare recipients to drink themselves to death while remaining on welfare is racism. It is the prejudice of low expectations. Items 1 to 11 of my amendments remove the exception so that no welfare recipients can use drug and alcohol abuse as an excuse for noncompliance with welfare rules. I understand that some senators support the removal of drug and alcohol abuse as an excuse for noncompliance, while others do not. I urge both groups of senators to support my amendments. Either all welfare recipients should be allowed to use drug and alcohol abuse as an excuse, or none should. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The remainder of my amendments relate to the government's new penalty regime. This new regime will apply to all welfare recipients except recipients of payments under the Community Development Program. My amendments would remove this exception so that all welfare recipients are subject to the same penalty regime for noncompliance with welfare rules. The new penalty regime involves more frequent suspension of payments, more frequent loss of payments and less discretion for bureaucrats to waive these rules. Whether or not you support these tougher penalties, I urge senators to support my amendments. Either all welfare recipients should face the tough new penalty regime, or none should. I commend my amendments to the chamber.</span>

The government will be opposing them. The government recognises that more can be done to build on the success of the Community Development Program. A tailored approach is required in remote Australia to respond to the unique challenges in remote communities, including weaker labour markets, fewer job opportunities and often difficult social conditions. Furthermore, access to the alcohol and drug services that would be required to complement the changes to drug and alcohol exemptions needs to be assessed and improved before it is introduced into remote areas. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is consulting on what a new remote employment and participation framework should look like. Discussions with communities, providers and other stakeholders has been underway over the last nine months, with a formal discussion paper released in 2017. It is important that any changes to CDP are considered through this separate process, looking at the model as a whole and continuing to focus on engaging with remote jobseekers and supporting them into jobs. Therefore, CDP is excluded from the following changes included in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017: the new targeted compliance framework, the tightening of exemptions and the tightening of reasonable excuses for noncompliance due to drug or alcohol misuse. The CDP will operate under existing arrangements until a new model is implemented.</span>

Those on CDP have a hard enough time at the moment, as it is, without forcing more compliance regime measures on them. The program needs urgent reform. We saw the latest list of penalties applied to those in remote communities. So my advice to Senator Leyonhjelm would be: join us in calling on the government to change CDP. That is a completely separate program for Aboriginal people that is disproportionately impacting on a section of our community and causing huge detrimental impacts. So, no, we won't be supporting these amendments that have the potential to cause even further harm to those people who are stuck on CDP.</span>

This is unnecessary and would weaken the deterrence effect of penalties for those persistently non-compliant jobseekers who are deliberately not meeting their requirements while on payment, despite being fully capable. This would effectively be reproducing waivers, which are a significant problem with the current compliance framework and one of the key reasons why we're proposing a new framework.</span>

Okay, there's the first process of the three points, and then we've got, as you get to the fourth point, a demerit point and then five, six and seven. By and large, as I understand the legislation, the employment provider will be dealing with the first three points and the application of that. What I'm keen to know, because there'll be little involvement of DHS before that, is: how are we ensuring that there is consistency across how those points are provided?</span>

As is currently the case, all financial penalty decisions will be made by the Department of Human Services, not by providers. Jobseekers will continue to be able to appeal against financial penalties, first to a Centrelink-authorised review officer and then, if they continue to dispute, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>

What will the review period be—yearly, six-monthly? In terms of the consistency and fairness of the approach that's been taken by employment providers, particularly in the early phase when this is being implemented, how often will those reviews be undertaken? This is a significant change. I have to put it on the record that I get lots of complaints about employment providers—as you'll be aware, since I raise it quite frequently during estimates—and so there needs to be confidence that employment providers are applying this very different system appropriately, fairly and consistently.</span>

This review would of course look at the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended effects, taking into account the views of relevant experts and stakeholder groups. Further, a core role of the Public Service is the continued evaluation, as I've stated, of the programs and policies which they are responsible for implementing as well as staying informed about various stakeholder views. So there is the continuous evaluation and monitoring of the program.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The eight-week compliance penalty of the old compliance regime had a very significant impact and it happened all at once. So we can appreciate what the government is trying to do in having a one-week suspension, a two-week suspension and a four-week suspension. But by the time you get to a four-week suspension from payments you've already had a three-week non-payment period. By the time you get to four, that's seven. The concern is that somebody could go through a cycle of a number of weeks of suspension. People can be almost as badly off, potentially, as they were under the old regime. We want to apply a cap to this process so it's really clear.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to ask the government: what is the process for ensuring that people don't get into this trap? This is supposed to be about improving the system. If you don't think this is going the work, how are you going to ensure that people don't end up suffering multiple periods of a lot of time off income support?</span>

That's the whole purpose of the new compliance framework. The system is designed so that jobseekers do not enter the intensive compliance phase—the penalty phase—unless they are able but unwilling to meet their requirements. And I think that 'unless they are able but unwilling to meet their requirements' is a really important part of it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A jobseeker who repeatedly fails to comply with agreed requirements and gets their first strike in the penalty phase will lose one week of income support payment, which, as you know, is half of their fortnight's payment. If that jobseeker has further requirements during that fortnight, they may incur a further penalty if they do not meet those requirements. Jobseekers who face a two-week penalty or are cancelled from payment for four weeks will not have obligations and will not face further penalty during this period, as they are not receiving payment during that period. If they wish to remain engaged with employment services, they are able to do this, and they can volunteer for servicing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobseekers in the penalty phase who then meet their requirements for three months return all the way back to the personal responsibility phase with zero demerits—so, totally reset—providing further incentive for persistently non-compliant jobseekers to reform their behaviour. It is quite literally about reforming your behaviour.</span>

The problem—and ACOSS pointed this out during the Senate inquiry—is that it is not necessarily as clear-cut as people wilfully not meeting their requirements. It's just not that clear-cut, and in their submission they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed system relies very heavily on drawing a clear distinction between people who are willing to comply but face difficulties, and people who wilfully and repeatedly avoid activities requirements. Our … experience … has taught us that distinctions are in fact more blurred, people's circumstances do change, and many vulnerabilities go unreported. Discretion to tailor responses to non-compliance is essential to ensure that any compliance system remains humane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was from ACOSS's submission to the inquiry into the bill. I've had the experience of meeting and talking to a lot of people who have in fact suffered penalties from the current system. It is true that it's not so clear-cut either that you deliberately don't do something or that in fact you've made that clear-cut decision, 'Well, I'm just not going to comply.' There are really blurred areas here, and the system as it stands at the moment doesn't really account for or deal with those. As you said, they'll go back to zero and, because it's not all that clear-cut, they could start racking up those demerit points again and be in the same cycle and off income support again, and it could happen relatively quickly. This is an attempt to ensure that doesn't happen. What are you doing to ensure that it doesn't happen?</span>

There will also be mandated assessments, generally, as you know, when a jobseeker incurs both a third and fourth demerit. Principal carer parents and those in disability employment services are generally more compliant than most jobseekers and, as a result, will actually benefit from the arrangements and the personal responsibility phase. These jobseekers will benefit from the new tools to manage their requirements and greater flexibility in scheduling or rescheduling their appointments. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional safeguards are in place for vulnerable jobseekers. Vulnerable jobseekers are identified on the IT systems used by employment providers and the Department of Human Services by a vulnerability indicator, which ensures that providers and Department of Human Services staff are aware that the jobseeker's personal circumstances may impact on their capacity to meet their requirements. A vulnerability indicator does not exempt a jobseeker from their requirements or from being subject to compliance action if they do not meet them, but it must be considered when deciding whether or not an activity is actually appropriate for the particular jobseeker. Identified vulnerabilities are also carefully taken into consideration when a determination is made about whether the person has a reasonable excuse under social security law and, therefore, whether a penalty or a suspension should be applied. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of jobseekers who disclose barriers of their own accord—as is currently the case, a comprehensive range of support responses will continue to apply for jobseekers who disclose barriers. Those responses may range from altering the expectation of jobseekers in light of their barriers through to assistance with emergency accommodation. Employment services providers, both Jobactive and DES, may enlist the support of allied health professionals and the Department of Human Services, which can provide assistance with access to alternative benefit payments where appropriate, referral for emergency accommodation and access to social workers. Under the new framework, earlier identification of barriers will allow better tailoring of requirements to jobseekers' circumstances and early referral for assessment for other existing support, if appropriate.</span>

I understood what you said earlier, in terms of the reassessment process through the first two sets of penalties, as being as they apply. If a vulnerability is established during that process, would that mean that the penalty, whether it's one week or two weeks, wouldn't apply? How will that be handled if there's a reassessment during that time? As I said, many vulnerabilities go unreported for a variety of reasons, including issues around stigma and not having the confidence that they'll be believed.</span>

It's helped to clarify things, but it doesn't go to the overarching question that I was asking in terms of a cap. It is possible that somebody could go through the whole process—have the seven weeks—and then go back to the start. They could have a cycle of those through the year. I've listened and heard all that you've said about the various interventions that can be made but, bearing all that in mind, it is possible they could have a series of suspensions going through the whole process—one, two, four, start again.</span>

You'd have all the interventions et cetera that were being looked at, particularly if they've already been through the system once. That would already be flagged on their system, and providers would be looking out for that.</span>

Is there then another flag when somebody has been through, say, three cycles of this? Instead of them rolling through, is there a process that then says, 'We're having multiple failures here'? If they've been through a series of cycles, they're going to have very little income. They're going to be existing for quite a period of time on no income. How do we support people who are going through that process if there is no cap on the number of times that they can be suspended?</span>

That is actually what the system is targeting, because the people you are referring to are likely to be those who are consistently, wilfully non-compliant. If there are genuine vulnerabilities, these should be picked up along the way, hence quite literally the number of demerit points, review points et cetera and the scaling of the penalty to ensure that you are assisting those who do need assistance and you are properly targeting those who are gaming the system.</span>

Quite frankly, the other compliance measures are picking up anybody who is trying to defraud the system. When they get to the four-week compliance process, you said that they can voluntary opt in—and I appreciate that—but there's nothing they can do to avoid the four-week penalty, is there? It's four weeks; that's it. They can do other reengagement activities or volunteer back into their employment service provider.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HLL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BUSHBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  Much has been made of the arrest of the Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi for slapping an Israeli soldier. Those promoting her cause would have us believe that Ms Tamimi is the poor victim of Israeli brutality, motivated by anger at the injuring of her cousin by Israeli troops into slapping a soldier trespassing on her land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is very different. For the last five years Ahed Tamimi, and, to a lesser extent, her siblings, have become notorious for their constant efforts to provoke Israeli soldiers, to the extent that Ahed Tamimi, with her curly blonde hair, has become known as 'Shirley Temper'. The typical and often repeated modus operandi is for a Tamimi child to approach Israeli soldiers and slap, hit, kick, spit at and insult them, while the Tamimi family adults wait with camera in hand for the provoked soldiers to retaliate, so they can then show the world the so-called Israeli aggression against children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These exploits have earned Ahed and her family a significant social media following, especially among Palestinians. Ahed's mother, Nariman Tamimi, was filming the incident involving the soldiers and immediately following it asked Ahed what sort of message she wanted to convey to viewers. She was filmed saying: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I hope that everyone will take part in the demonstrations as this is the only means to achieve the result. Our strength is in our stones, and I hope that the world will unite to liberate Palestine, because Trump made his declaration and—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">need to take responsibility for any response that comes from us. Whether it is stabbings or suicide bombings or throwing stones, everyone must do his part and we must unite in order for our message to be heard that we want to liberate Palestine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat, this poster girl for Palestinian innocence called for stabbing attacks, suicide bombings and the throwing of rocks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it would appear likely that Ahed has been raised to seek and glorify violence. In fact, her parents, Bassem and Nariman, are also well-known for their anti-Semitic social media posts glorifying terror attacks and calling for the end of Israel. Other members of the family are convicted terrorists, including the mastermind of the Sbarro pizzeria bombing in 2001, which killed 15 people including Malki Roth, who was then the same age as Ahed is now and whose parents were Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those professing such concern for Ahed's welfare should perhaps question whether her upbringing is akin to child abuse or to the use of child soldiers. At the very least, she is being exploited. In other circumstances, they would, rightly, be quick to condemn this. Instead, they are more likely to condemn Israel for supposed transgressions of Palestine rights, such as its arrest and detention of children, its system of military law in the West Bank and its check points and security barriers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what's behind those. Yes, Israel arrests and detains Palestinian children. Most of those arrested are in their mid to late teens and are arrested for acts such as throwing rocks at cars or security forces, which can be lethal, and even more serious attacks such as stabbings and bombings. If children in Australia were throwing rocks at passing cars or at police, we would want them arrested and detained, too. Ahed herself was arrested not just for slapping a soldier but also for throwing rocks and for the incitement mentioned earlier. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, Israel has a separate system of military law for the West Bank. This is not out of a desire to discriminate against Palestinians but out of legal necessity. If Israel were to apply its own civil legal system to the West Bank, that would amount to annexation and would no doubt be roundly condemned. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, Israel carries out arrests, including of minors, in night-time raids. It does so because experience has shown this is far safer for both the Israeli forces and the local Palestinians than going in during the day, when Palestinians riot and attack the Israelis, and the Israelis are forced to defend themselves, leading to casualties on both sides. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, Israel has a security barrier to separate Palestinians from Israelis and has checkpoints, but these were built out of necessity. In the intifada launched in 2000 in the wake of Yasser Arafat's refusal to accept the Camp David peace offer, more than 1,000 Israelis were killed, and thousands more were seriously injured by Palestinian terrorism, including many notorious suicide bombings. The intifada was finally defeated by those measures. The checkpoints, other than those at the security barrier, are often unguarded, depending on the security situation at the time, and the security barrier can ultimately be relocated or removed, depending on the nature of any peace settlement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One aspect of Palestinian violence that is not widely understood is the role of Palestinian incitement. Palestinian children like Ahed Tamimi are subjected to nonstop incitement and glorification of terror from the Palestinian National Authority, Israel's supposed peace partner. They get it in their schools, on TV, on the radio and in the mosques—constant messages that Israel is illegitimate and that the Jews stole their land. Israelis do commit crimes against Palestinians, including occasional terror attacks. But, when this happens, the perpetrators are pursued and arrested, and the attacks are condemned from the Prime Minister down. By contrast, the Palestinian authority name streets, public squares, community facilities and even children's soccer tournaments after Palestinian terrorists who have killed Israelis. Perhaps even more invidiously, Palestinian terrorists who are captured by Israel are paid generous lifetime pensions, far higher than the average wage, by the Palestinian authority—and, if they are killed in the attack, the pension goes to their family. The more serious the attack is, the higher the pension. The Palestinians apparently need billions of dollars of international aid each year, yet the Palestinian authority made US$347 million worth of such payments for terror in 2017 and has budgeted US$403 million for 2018. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those who would say that all of this results from Israel's occupation of the West Bank, so let's consider why Israel is there. Israel took control of the West Bank from Jordan in 1967 in the course of a defensive war, the Six-Day War. It took the West Bank and, also, East Jerusalem from Jordan, following Jordanian attacks on Israeli positions. When Jordan occupied East Jerusalem, Jews were expelled, were barred from visiting the holy sites, and all synagogues were destroyed. By contrast, Israel allows all faiths control of and access to their holy sites in Jerusalem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Immediately after the war, Israel offered to return land captured, in exchange for peace, but the meeting of the Arab League in Khartoum in August and September 1967 responded with the infamous three noes: no negotiation, no recognition and no peace. Despite this, in 1979, Israel agreed to return Sinai—also captured in 1967, but from Egypt—to Egypt, uprooting all Israeli settlements there, and has had a peace, albeit often cool, with Egypt ever since. In 2000, at Camp David, under the auspices of the Oslo accords, Israel offered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a state consisting of all of Gaza, most of the West Bank, a shared capital in Jerusalem and a settlement package for the Palestinian refugees. Arafat refused—despite being urged by many, including Saudi Arabia, to take the deal—and instead launched the intifada. An improved offer in early 2001 at Taba met the same response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2005, Israel's Sharon government, searching for another way to achieve peace, withdrew completely from Gaza, leaving behind greenhouses and other agricultural infrastructure. The hope was that the Palestinians there would establish a peaceful, prosperous society living in harmony with Israel, and this would provide the impetus for further peace moves. The reality was, sadly, very different. The greenhouses were immediately destroyed, and rockets soon began flying over the border, aimed at Israeli communities. In 2007, Hamas staged a coup and took over control of Gaza. Since then, there have been in excess of 10,000 rockets and mortars fired at Israel from Gaza; terror tunnels have been constructed under the Israeli border, using vast amounts of international aid intended for Gaza civilians; and the result has been three wars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made an even more generous offer than those previously tendered. Under that peace plan offer, the Palestinian state would have all of Gaza and almost all of the West Bank, with land from inside Israel in compensation for the rest. There was to be a land bridge between the West Bank and Gaza; a shared capital in Jerusalem, with Palestinian control over Muslim holy sites; a limited return of Palestinian refugees to Israel; and compensation for all other Palestinian refugees and their millions of descendants. As Palestinian authority president Mahmoud Abbas recently admitted, he rejected the offer out of hand—again, without so much as a counteroffer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears that the sticking point is that any agreement would require the Palestinians to genuinely accept Israel's right to exist in peace and that there could be no further claims, including the so-called return of the refugees and their millions of descendants. This influx of in excess of five million Palestinians would mean the end of Israel as a Jewish state and is therefore completely incompatible with the two-state peace the Palestinians profess to be seeking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth noting that this demand for the return of not only the original refugees but their descendants—treating the descendants as refugees too—is a demand made only for Palestinians and is not repeated for any of the world's many refugee populations. Since the election of the Netanyahu government in 2008, Israeli measures to encourage peace talks have included an unprecedented 10-month moratorium on building in settlements, and the release of Palestinian prisoners. As you can see, the matter is not as simple as it appears. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:00</span>):  One of Australia's defining and proudest features is our support for and maintenance of a universal public health system. Unlike the United States of America, your access to good-quality medical care in Australia is not dictated by the sum of money in your wallet; it's simply dictated by your Australian citizenship and your entitlement to good-quality public health care. That is something that we on this side of the chamber have long stood for, whether we go back to the Whitlam government's introduction of Medicare or the continued efforts of Labor governments to both maintain and build Medicare and to resist attacks on it from the Liberal and National parties when they have been in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Liberal and National parties have a long history in Australia of undermining Australia's fantastic public healthcare system. From the very outset, they opposed the introduction of Medicare, and, at every chance they have ever had in government, they have whittled it away, making cuts to Medicare, attempting to privatise services and making good-quality public health care that much more difficult for most Australians. And this government is no different. We've seen it year after year impose cuts on public hospitals which have made health care in the public system not quite what it should be for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's worse, from a Queensland point of view, is that, right up and down Queensland, right now, Malcolm Turnbull's LNP members of parliament are backing every single one of his government's cuts to public health. In fact, they're supporting the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, in refusing to pay for procedures that have already been performed in Queensland hospitals. The Queensland government has estimated that, right now, the federal government here in Canberra owes Queensland hospitals close to $1 billion for services that have already been performed by Queensland hospitals. Not only is it cutting money into the future but it is actually refusing to pay its bills for operations and other services that have already been delivered. You would like to think that our LNP members of parliament from Queensland would actually be doing something about that, but, as usual, they are nodding and smiling as Malcolm Turnbull and his government take the axe to the public health system in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that amount of money that is owed by Canberra to Queensland hospitals—$1 billion—amount to in practical terms? With that money, 622 more doctors could be employed in Queensland hospitals; 2,168 extra nurses could be employed in Queensland hospitals; and nearly 200,000 more medical procedures could be being performed in Queensland hospitals for Queenslanders right now. On top of the amounts that are overdue and owing by the federal government, there are more cuts to come under this government to Queensland hospitals. All up, between 2017 and 2020, there will be another $160 million cut in federal government funding to Queensland hospitals. This is the price of LNP members of parliament from Queensland who are more interested in toeing the line from Malcolm Turnbull and his government than in fighting for their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Rockhampton only on Friday last week, meeting with health workers who are directly affected by these cuts. In Central Queensland alone, which takes in the federal electorates of Capricornia and Flynn, the Queensland government estimates that local hospitals are owed about $39 million from the federal government for services that have already been performed in those hospitals. That's 25 doctors that could have been employed. That's 86 nurses that could have been employed. And that's over 14,000 extra procedures that could be being performed right now in Central Queensland if only the federal government would pay its bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, there is $6 million more in cuts coming for Central Queensland hospitals over the next three years as a result of cuts made by the Turnbull government and backed in by local MPs Michelle Landry and Ken O'Dowd. I heard from local health workers about the impacts this is having. It is placing even more pressure on their emergency departments, and patients are having to wait longer for elective surgery and operations—all because Canberra will not pay its bills and keeps cutting funding from Queensland hospitals into the future. It is incredibly disappointing. But yet again there is complete silence from local LNP members Michelle Landry and Ken O'Dowd, as they nod and do whatever Malcolm Turnbull tells them to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same story up and down Queensland. The Cairns and Torres Strait health districts are owed, according to Queensland government estimates, about $76 million for surgeries that have already been performed, with another $11 million in cuts yet to come. What is the member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, doing? Nothing. The local hospital in Townsville is owed $66 million for services already performed and, in the future, they are facing another $11 million in cuts from the federal government. Despite the great efforts of local MP Cathy O'Toole in Herbert and her state colleagues, those bills remain outstanding. In Mackay, which is in the electorate of Dawson, held by George Christensen, the health district is owed $29 million by the federal government and has another $4.5 million in cuts yet to come. I've already mentioned Central Queensland—owed $39 million, according to the Queensland government, with $6 million more in cuts to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even when you get down to the south-east corner of Queensland, where the LNP, let's face it, hold a lot of seats at the moment—and you would think they would be in there fighting for their communities—in the metropolitan north health district, which takes in the federal electorates of Dickson and Longman, the Queensland government estimates that the local hospitals there are owed $187 million for services already performed, and there are future cuts coming of $32 million on top of that. When you go to the other side of the river, in the metropolitan south district, the Queensland government estimates that their hospitals on the south side of Brisbane are owed $196 million in cuts, with another $29 million in cuts coming. Right down in the south of the state, on the Gold Coast, the Queensland governments estimates that it's owed $97 million for services already performed, with another $16 million in cuts coming from this federal government. And what are we hearing from any of the federal LNP members, whether it be the member for Dickson, the member for Petrie, the member for Bonner or the member for Forde? Absolutely nothing. Yet again, they take their riding instructions from Canberra and do nothing for their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queenslanders are speaking up. They have had enough. They expect their members of parliament, no matter what side they're from, to come to Canberra and fight for their communities—to fight for decent funding for public hospitals, to fight for decent funding for schools and to stop big tax cuts going to companies that are based in Sydney and Melbourne at the expense of proper services in Brisbane, Central Queensland, North Queensland and across the state. Instead, the LNP federal members of parliament from Queensland come down to Canberra, get their riding instructions from the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, and then return home and tell their constituents what they can get. It is not about seeing the member for Capricornia being the voice in Canberra; she, like so many of her colleagues, is Malcolm Turnbull's voice back in Capricornia, as is the case for every other federal LNP member from Queensland. It's about time they started doing their jobs. It's about time they started standing up for their communities and demanding the fair funding that hospitals in their areas need to ensure that their constituents continue to get good-quality public health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure Queenslanders, whether they live in Central Queensland, North Queensland, western Queensland or the south-east, that federal Labor stand with them in wanting to make sure that we have the best public health services anywhere in the world. We will continue to demand those good public health services and we will continue to demand that this federal government puts in the funding that is required to make sure that Queenslanders get the very best medical care. If the LNP members of parliament won't do their job, Queenslanders can be assured that Labor members will come to Canberra and fight for every dollar that Queensland needs to provide good-quality medical care.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:09</span>):  On 19 February this year, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters conducted a hearing in Adelaide into the decision of the Court of Disputed Returns in relation to its finding that former senator Bob Day was not eligible to be elected as a senator under section 44(iv) of the Constitution. No <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of the hearing was made, and Mr Day's opening statement to the inquiry cannot be found on the public record. Accordingly, I will now read his statement so that it is on the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I only learned of this Inquiry's existence on 29 December last year. I quickly put together a submission and lodged it 2 days later — on 31 December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">First and foremost, can I say this is all a bit perplexing. A Senate Inquiry is established with former Senator Rod Culleton and myself named as of particular interest. The Inquiry was established on 6 December with submissions to be received by no later than 22 December. Neither Rod Culleton nor I were informed of any of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Has there ever been a Senate Inquiry into a former Senator where that Senator has not been made aware of its existence? I doubt it. It would be like the police inquiring into an incident and the person involved in the incident being neither informed of the inquiry nor interviewed about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After lodging my submission I was informed that it would not be accepted as a formal submission, thus preventing its publication by the committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A full description of the events leading to my disqualification is in my submission, which I presume Members have read, however I would like to highlight a number of key points:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">1.   At no time between September 2013 when I was elected and December 2015 when the lease was signed on the building in question, was I ever informed of any potential constitutional problems with the lease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">2.   Throughout those 2 years and 3 months I had countless discussions with numerous departmental officers. However again, at no stage did anyone mention Section 44.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">3.   On 7 November 2016, in answer to a question in the senate, the Special Minister of State Senator Cormann said, "Former Senator Day subsequently provided information to the department about vendor-financing arrangements underpinning his sale of the 77 Fullarton Road property. Related financial arrangements caused concerns about whether then Senator Day in fact remained connected to the Fullarton Road property. Subsequent to that, and being aware of all of the information, the department advised me (Sen Cormann) that it was open to me, and that it would not be a conflict to make rental payments under the lease from 1 March forward. The issue, to be frank, was not a concern to the department at that point in time" and "at no point did I receive any advice from the Department of Finance that the lease signed on 1 December 2015 in itself and in the absence of rental payments could cause a potential breach of section 44 of the Constitution".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">4.   Notwithstanding that advice from the Department, the then Special Minister of State Senator Ryan obtained a private legal opinion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">5.   Minister Ryan provided that private legal opinion to me and then Senate President Stephen Parry who contacted me on 28 October with the grim news that he was going to advise the senate on the next sitting day of its existence and then refer me to the High Court. Faced with that I felt I had no choice but to resign immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">6.   My family business was experiencing difficulties at that time and whilst I had been contemplating resigning, I had started to work my way through those problems. The Special Minister of State's advice and Senate President's actions however put paid to that idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">7.   Notwithstanding the Department's actions over the previous three years, and the authority of three Special Ministers of State to proceed with the lease as arranged, the government argued in the High Court that I should be disqualified.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The implications of my disqualification fall into 4 categories:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">1.   The implications for the electors of South Australia</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">2.   The implications for the parliament</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">3.   The implications for future members and senators and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">4.   The implications for me personally</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the 2013 and 2016 federal elections, enough electors gave either me or my party Family First enough first preference and subsequent preference votes to enable me to be elected to represent them in the Australian senate. The consequence of my disqualification has not reflected the will of the voters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The implications for future members and senators is disturbing to say the least. I was a cross-bencher. Is it only cross-benchers who are to be referred to the High Court without their agreement?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I note there's a Mexican stand-off in the parliament at the moment over the Member for Longman Susan Lamb who is a dual citizen. She and her party both claim she took reasonable steps to renounce her British citizenship and therefore shouldn't be referred to the High Court. The argument in Susan Lamb's case is 'did she or did she not take reasonable steps'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When my case reached the High Court, two hearings were held—the first before a single judge—Justice Michelle Gordon, to establish the facts, and the second before the full bench to decide my fate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Justice Gordon found that I had properly and legitimately disposed of the property in question—including paying the full stamp duty on the transfer, that I was not a party to the lease, and that in her opinion I had done all I thought was required to comply with the constitution. Yet I was referred to the High Court and Susan Lamb hasn't. There is obviously one rule for members of a major party and another rule for those who are not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Had I known then what I know now, my Party and I would have opposed a referral to the High Court. And what would President Parry have done then? Put a motion forward for a hostile referral to the High Court based on a vague indirect pecuniary interest asking the Court to overturn the Webster case? I don't think so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As mentioned in my submission, Professor Graeme Orr of the University of Queensland said that for the High Court to change the law and then backdate it to someone who had relied on a previous ruling seems somewhat unfair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The implication in my case is, a Minister could get a legal opinion about a cross-bencher to simply put pressure on him or her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As most of you would know, I voted with the government 90% of the time -more than any other crossbencher. So why did the government argue I should be disqualified? Would my disqualification give the government some political advantage? Or was it simply to prove the adage "no good turn goes unpunished"?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given the Department's advice that there was no conflict, the government could have just as easily argued I should not be disqualified. It's hard not to be suspicious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As we all know, the Department of Finance provides members and senators with a document this thick about every minor allowance and entitlement you can think of, but not apparently anything about breaching the constitution. Does the Department of Finance owe a newly elected senator any duty of care in this area?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was found by the High Court that I benefited from an 'indirect pecuniary interest' in a contract with the Commonwealth. What now are the implications for any member or senator who owns say a Defence Service Home?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since the Senate President informed the senate in November 2016 of the legal advice in his possession, I have been accused by senators, members of parliament, journalists and members of the public of all manner of things including fraud, corruption, misconduct in public office, cronyism, hypocrisy, self-entitlement, a cover up, ripping off taxpayers, trading my vote for office accommodation, and having my hand in the till.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The implications are obvious. A person's life and reputation can be ruined. I ask that this evidence, together with my submission, be made public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the end of Mr Day's statement and, because it will now appear in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, it will be public.</span>
