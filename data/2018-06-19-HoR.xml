                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I rise today to speak in support, albeit reluctant support, of the government's proposed Australian Astronomical Observatory (Transition) Bill 2018. This bill seeks to amend the Australian Astronomical Observatory Act 2010 to amend the short title of the act, substitute a new outline for the act and abolish the Australian Astronomical Observatory and the AAO Advisory Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to abolish the Australian Astronomical Observatory and allow for its function to be transitioned to two consortiums to manage the functions of the body. The functions that are now being outsourced, so to speak, are the operation of 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope on land owned by the Australian National University at Siding Spring near Coonabarabran in New South Wales, which is to be transferred to a consortium led by the very able ANU, and the operation of the astronomical instrumentation capability at North Ryde in Sydney, which is to be transferred to a consortium led by Macquarie University.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will give effect to the 2017-18 budget measure on access to world-leading astronomy infrastructure, which saw Australia sign up to a strategic partnership with the European Southern Observatory. This powerful strategic partnership allows Australian optical astronomers access to one of the most advanced telescopes in the world at the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile. This is a great thing. This strategic partnership will cost, in Commonwealth funding, $119.2 million over the decade from 2017, or $26.1 million over the forward estimates from 2017-18 to 2020-21. I know that many working in the field, many Australian astronomers, have for years argued the case for greater access to these facilities, so it's good to see that we are encouraging and facilitating that as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation adheres to the most recent 10-year strategic plan, the decadal plan for Australian astronomy 2016-2025, produced by the Academy of Science, which has called for access to eight-metre class optical astronomy infrastructure that is currently not available in this country. The plan also calls for maintenance of efforts in terms of support for Australian domestic capability, including supporting the Australian national observatory and its capabilities. It is encouraging that we in this place are facilitating this vital research, and I'm very pleased this is happening. However, we in the Labor Party are reluctantly supporting this legislation, because, like most things on this government's agenda, it does seek to cut corners wherever it can. This government cares a bit more about how well or badly they are doing in the polls than about the future of this nation and its innovators and researchers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation proposes to off-load the main government astronomical assets, the Anglo-Australian Telescope near Coonabarabran and the AAO instrumentation, onto the Australian university sector. That's right: this government is seeking to off-load the work to our universities, which, as we already know, are apprehensive about funding arrangements and cuts due to this government's failure to provide certainty and proper funding to the sector. This government, which is quite happy to cut university funding by $2.2 billion over the next four years, is trying to force unis down the path of a deregulation system, which has failed before, by starving them of critical infrastructure funding as well as ongoing funding. At the same time, they're expecting universities to stump up the cash to keep these key astronomy facilities operational. It is quite a burden this government is seeking to put on the university sector without giving them additional funding. And this is ostensibly done to save the budget $26.1 million over the forward estimates. It's just another bit of trickery, if you ask me. What's happening is they are moving the burden of maintaining these facilities from the Department of Innovation, Industry and Science onto entities that are funded by the Department of Education and Training. As I said, it puts further strain on an already overstretched university sector, which is so important to this country, and on to its overall research infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transition is not without cost. It is expected that a small number of jobs will be lost in this transition: four to five at the Anglo-Australian Telescope and up to another nine at the North Ryde instrumentation laboratories. This is a government that has been spruiking an innovation nation, yet is happy to cull the jobs of some of the brightest researchers and technicians in the country. And by constraining universities, their funding and their research funding, this government continues to put our researchers down, whether they be researchers in social sciences, humanities or the technical sciences that we're talking about today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a world leader in the field of astronomy, and we have worked very hard in this place to maintain this regional leadership. Currently the Department of Innovation, Industry and Science has two broad groups that manage Australia's government astronomy assets in partnership with the research community. The first group is the Australian Square Kilometre Array office. It is managing our engagement with the construction of the very exciting Square Kilometre Array, half of which is being built in Western Australia while the other half is being built in South Africa. This will become the world's most advanced radio telescope. I had a bit to do with the establishment of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, headquartered at UWA, and also worked with great partners at Curtin University on the other side of the great Swan River.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ICRAR, the International Centre of Radio Astronomy Research, as part of the Square Kilometre Array effort, has made great advancements. Just recently, they reached a very important milestone with the first SKA-low prototype station being completed on site at Murchison, which has that very wonderful radio quiet that is an asset of that part of Western Australia. ICRAR also provides a remarkable opportunity for science outreach in this country, as does astronomy in general. ICRAR, through its work at Astrofest held at Curtin University, has seen more than 2½ thousand people come along and access very high-quality optical telescopes to not only learn a bit more about the important science that is going on in the international centre itself and the development of the SKA, but also for the pure enjoyment and love of looking further into the sky with the optical telescopes out there at Bentley.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other Australian astronomy group managed by the department is the Australian Astronomical Observatory, which, since 2010, has managed access to the Anglo-Australian Telescope and maintained our national optical instrumentation capability. It's based in North Ryde, in Sydney. This legislation will abolish the AAO as a division of the department on 1 July this year, along with all AAO governance structures. The legislation also seeks to allow the transfer of necessary assets to external entities, in this case the two university-based and university-funded consortiums. As I said before, the consortium for the Anglo-Australian Telescope will be led by the ANU and it will include Curtin University and UWA—two of our great universities in Western Australia—as well as Macquarie University, Monash University, Swinburne University of Technology, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales, University of Queensland, University of Southern Queensland, University of Sydney, University of Tasmania, and Western Sydney University. So it's a quite remarkable consortium of universities that, whilst having their funding cut by this government, are also expected to chip in to maintain the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The establishment of a national optical instrumentation capability which will build on and further develop the world-class instrumentation functions of the AAO will be led by Macquarie University and Australia Astronomy Limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it was first constructed, the Anglo-Australian Telescope was one of the most advanced in the world and its operation gave Australian and international scientists access to the stars above in an unparalleled fashion. Additionally, it helped develop Australia's advanced scientific and industrial capabilities. However, this facility is now 44 years old. Despite this, it remains an important part of Australia's research infrastructure and we on this side of the House are relieved to see that these assets, as part of the AAO, will be maintained for the next seven years, making the AAT a very important and remaining-vibrant 51-year-old workhorse. While its future beyond that timeframe is not known, I'm sure this government have some plan in mind to keep it going. Especially given the fact that they wouldn't mind seeing us all work until we're 70 years of age before we have access to a pension, why should research facilities be any different?</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What effect does this bill have on the astronomical research sector? We scrutinised this bill carefully, as we do all bills. It seeks to maintain and strengthen Australia's position as a first-class nation at the forefront of astronomical research by underscoring the need for access to world-class facilities, and that is something I most certainly support. It recognises that, in order to push forward into the next generation of research about the galaxy, our facilities need multinational partners to fund and construct on the scale and complexity that is required. We know that Australia has already begun to transition from a national research infrastructure portfolio of medium-tiered nationally-owned facilities into multinational partnerships worth billions that create world-class landmark research facilities, and this has been undertaken over many decades. Following on from this, Australia is already playing a critical role in two of the world's biggest billion-dollar astronomy projects: the SKA, which I spoke of earlier, and the Giant Magellan Telescope, which is seeking to be the very first of an entirely new class of extremely large telescopes, as they're referred to, as Australia constructs key components and instrumentation for the project. Both the GMT and the SKA represent a massive increase in the capabilities of these types of instruments and it's matched by a massive leap in the physical size of the telescope. Indeed, the last time such a massively sized leap in scale happened, humanity discovered other solar systems, the black hole, the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and evidence of the universe's continued acceleration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With such advances in technology, what results is great excitement and proof that the future in this sector is bright. However, future advances will require a sustained and long-term approach to research funding. Many researchers in the country will be well aware of the strains put upon them due to short-termism in government and in university funding agreements. In a former life, I spent 10 years working for the University of Western Australia and witnessed the move from longer-term funding contracts in research to short-term funding contracts, which led to scientists and researchers from all parts of the combined research endeavour leaving that sector and the public losing the capacity of great researchers across all our universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted while we talk about science and astronomical science in this place that, over the past five years, government support for science has been falling. It's now at its lowest share of GDP since 2005. The government's share of total research spending is now smaller than at any time since the 1980s, and that's a sad thing, in my opinion. Research funding is skewing more towards applied research than basic research. Continued mediocre investment in research and, in my view, this government's disgraceful dismissal of universities and the realities of their funding challenges endanger overall research effort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to talk about science and research in this place. I spruik at any time I get the chance that the developments made in this nation based on science are remarkable. We would not have been able to develop the south-west of Western Australia as a great agricultural effort without the agricultural scientists who identified the missing elements in our soil that meant that we could not grow wheat so well or that the sheep would die of Denmark wasting disease. Science has played a remarkable part in the development of my state, so, in talking about science, I'm pleased that Labor is committed to ensuring that, by 2030, three per cent of our national gross domestic product will be applied to science research and development. Under Labor, science research, innovation and education will be and are national priorities. We will have a dedicated cabinet minister for science, and that is critical to support efforts not only in the Australian astronomical area—as we have in this bill—but also across all regions of science and research in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned before that research is a long-term proposition. We need longer-term funding arrangements with, of course, proper accountability. Researchers and scientists need some certainty for their careers so that we don't drive them out of the very important endeavours that they're undertaking at research institutions and universities around this country. I'm a keen supporter of science in this country, particularly the work undertaken at universities. I objected very strongly when the minister for education, Senator Birmingham, accused universities of having rivers of gold. It only demonstrated his total lack of understanding of how universities are funded and how the money that comes from student fees has cross-subsidised the research effort in this country. In my view, this country has to face up to the challenge of science and research funding so that we might have a better future for all young people—like those who are watching from the gallery—so they have the opportunity to study science and do research at schools and at university.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  Last month, I took part in the Australian National University's Guinness world record attempt for the greatest number of telescopes pointed at once at the night sky. More than 285 stargazing parties were registered across Australia, with thousands of telescopes delivered across the country. We're not talking about cardboard telescopes; we're talking about good-quality, entry-level telescopes that you'd probably get from Australian Geographic shops to help Australians develop an interest in—perhaps even a love for—astronomy. The night of the big stargazing Guinness world record attempt, I went to the party out the front of Parliament House—it was freezing—with one of my staff. I was pleased to see my colleagues the member for Macquarie and Senator Ketter raising a telescope to the night sky as well as some luminaries from various departments at the Australian National University. World experts were standing with me when we were looking up at the Moon and stars, trying to break the record on a cold Canberra night. According to media reports, more than 40,000 people simultaneously observed the Moon through telescopes for 10 minutes, eclipsing the previous record set by the ANU in 2015 of 7,960 people. It will be a tough act to follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had Brian Schmidt with us on the lawns. Our event host was Professor Brian Cox, the rock star of astronomy. I have a huge crush on that man—I'm confessing that right here, right now! The night was telecast right across Australia. It was lovely looking at Professor Brian Cox and seeing him beamed right across Australia as part of this world record attempt. He said that breaking the record is only half of the story. He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The real value is that many thousands of Australians have been introduced to the wonders of the night sky, and many of those will be children. They will develop a lifelong interest in astronomy and science, and the impact of that will be felt in decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Cox's words have made me stop and think about space and space sciences, and the wonder that most of us had when we heard about the Apollo mission to the moon. I'm dating myself here, but I remember when I was a child—and there are some over across the aisle who may remember this as well—making my little lunar module when we were waiting, eagerly anticipating the first person on the moon. I had my little lunar module. I'd just done some research and found out that in the really posh, expensive breakfast cereals you actually got the plastic module. But I actually made mine out of cardboard—I think that was on the back of the relatively cheaper breakfast cereal that I had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Apollo missions to the moon excited all of Australia and the entire world. Here we were, as children, making our little lunar modules or pulling them out of the posh breakfast cereal. And there was Voyager's discoveries of other planets—and who could forget that first time we saw those amazing photos of the rings around Saturn?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the stargazing event sparked my interest, I've since learned even more about Canberra's longstanding and proud connection to space, astronomy and astrophysics. I'm lucky to be able to say that my electorate of Canberra is home to the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the ANU; the Mount Stromlo Observatory and the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mount Stromlo Observatory is one of the oldest institutions in the ACT, with astronomical observations occurring on the mountain since the early 1900s. The Commonwealth Solar Observatory was established on the site in 1924, and its research focused on solar and atmospheric physics. During the Second World War the observatory was used as an optical munitions establishment, and it was only after the war that its research direction shifted towards stellar and galactic astronomy. Aren't they fantastic words: stellar and galactic astronomy!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The observatory was amalgamated with the ANU in 1957 to support the university's astronomy degrees. A short time later the university established a second observatory at Siding Spring in the Warrumbungle mountains to provide a permanent dark site in response to the increasing growth and light in Canberra. Both of the observatories—Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring—formed one of the leading optical astronomical observatories in the world, supporting innovative and world-leading research into the structure and evolution of planets, stars and galaxies; the origin and development of the universe; and the physics of stars. Researchers also collaborate internationally, gaining access to different telescopes and keeping Australian astronomers at the forefront of astronomical research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANU's Vice-Chancellor Brian Schmidt, who was there stargazing with me and my colleagues just a few weeks ago, led a top science team at the observatory in the 1990s, studying the rate of change of the cosmic expansion. In 1998 his team reached the conclusion that the cosmic expansion was accelerating, contrary to expectations. What this acceleration meant—and I'm not an astronomy expert, so I hope I get this right, Brian—is that it showed the existence of dark energy, a top science breakthrough which culminated in Brian receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011, along with his peers Saul Perlmutter and Adam Reiss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brian's success is a great story, showing Canberra's research prowess and affinity with space. Unfortunately, the fires of 2003 damaged the telescope capabilities on Mount Stromlo, and since then some capabilities have moved to its sister site, the Siding Spring Observatory. Despite this, new capabilities and opportunities have since been developed at Mount Stromlo. It is now home to the Advanced Instrumentation Technology Centre, a world-class facility for developing astronomical instrumentation. I have been out there; you can only imagine the precision work that you have to do in this space to build and test small satellites and space payloads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Canberra's space connection isn't only about research. We have also had a role in supporting a number of space missions undertaken by NASA. During the mid 1960s, NASA built three tracking stations in Canberra. The Tidbinbilla Tracking Station, which is now the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex, opened in 1965 and is the only NASA tracking station in Australia still in operation. The Tidbinbilla Valley, 35 kilometres to the south-west of Canberra, was chosen to be the place for the deep space tracking station because of its close proximity to a city and because of the surrounding ridges—Cooleman Ridge, Urambi Hills and Bullen Range—that help to shield it from unwanted radio frequency noise. This is something unique to Canberra. During the Apollo program, Tidbinbilla was used for tracking the Apollo lunar module and was involved in the Mariner 4 spacecraft encounter with Mars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second station, the Orroral Valley Tracking Station, was opened in May 1965 in Namadgi National Park. It's role was orbiting satellite support, although it also supported the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975. Unfortunately, it was closed in 1985.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third station, Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, also located in Namadgi National Park, opened in 1967 and was built primarily to support the Apollo moon missions—mainly communications with the Apollo command module. It was the 26-metre antenna at Honeysuckle Creek that received and relayed to the world the first historic TV images of Neil Armstrong setting foot on the moon on 21 July 1969, not the dish at Parkes—and I'm sure I'm going to be getting lots of mail about this—in the member for Calare's electorate that the movie portrayed. After the cancellation of the Apollo project, the station continued its important work. The station supported Skylab until its re-entry in 1979 and then joined the Deep Space Network in support of the Viking and Voyager projects to investigate the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 1981 saw the closure of Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station. Its antenna was moved to Tidbinbilla to become known as Deep Space Station 46, and it's there today. After the antenna was removed, the rest of the facility was dismantled and knocked down. Its foundation, access road and parking area are all that remains of this historic facility. After all of these missions, there was a period of construction at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex, with bigger and better antennas built to allow communication with spacecraft over longer distances. The complex is still a working location and is managed by the CSIRO, and it continues to support satellite communications, space shuttle missions and the Hubble Space Telescope as they pass over the Indian Ocean and Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Astronomical Observatory (Transition) Bill 2018 focuses on the Australian Astronomical Observatory and unfortunate but necessary changes that we have to make. The observatory was established in 2010 to manage the operations of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The need for the observatory came about because the government's partner at the time, the United Kingdom, withdrew from the joint funding arrangement during the GFC. The funding secured from government would cover the operations of the observatory for 20 years, to 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a number of years, members of the scientific community have asked government to explore entering a partnership with the European Southern Observatory so that access could be given to the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile. The funding envelope for such an arrangement has been beyond the capabilities of government until recently, when the European Southern Observatory approached government with an offer of a 10-year strategic partnership at a cost of $119 million. The government will make the agreement happen by transferring existing optical astronomy resources from the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science to the research community, saving $25.2 million. The arrangements will give the astronomy community access to the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile. But it will also mean the end of an era; it will mean the end of the Australian Astronomical Observatory, because it will need to close. That is the purpose of today's bill. It will abolish the observatory and allow for its functions to be transitioned to two consortiums to manage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope is currently located at Siding Spring Observatory, owned by the ANU, and will be transferred to a consortium managed by the ANU. The astronomical instrumentation capability, currently located at North Ryde in Sydney, will be transferred to a consortium led by Macquarie University. What this bill clearly shows is the funding cliff that torments many areas of scientific research in Australia. It shows that it is real. In this particular case, the new agreement simply pushes astronomy research back from the precipice for another 10 years. At that time, further decisions will need to be made. Will Australia become a full member of the European Southern Observatory? Will the research community or government seek access for Australian science to another telescope? Or, worse, will we discontinue or abandon this area of scientific leadership that Australia has enjoyed for so long?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have another 10 years before we need to make any of these decisions, I will make it clear that Labor supports retaining Australia's capability in optical astronomy. As the member for Canberra, I am very, very proud that my community is home to one of Australia's universities that is leading the way in astronomy research and that we have a proud and longstanding connection already to space and space sciences. It makes sense that Canberra is considered the home for the new space agency, and I welcome the commitment that was made by the shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research last week at the Building Australia's Strategy for Space conference, organised by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, where he said that Labor was committed to basing the new space agency in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a natural fit. We have a rich history of the Mount Stromlo Observatory and the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex. We have the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the ANU, led by a vice-chancellor who knows space and won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery. We have the scientific skills of staff in the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. We have the engineering and coordination expertise in the Department of Defence and we have the Department of Communications and the Arts and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. These are the government agencies that industry comes to Canberra to work with, so it makes sense that Canberra would be the right fit, the natural home, for a space agency and for space facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have a great love for space. We saw it in the sixties, where everyone was out with their lunar modules and talking nothing but space and missions to the moon. Through the expertise that we have and through a commitment to a space agency and investment in space in the future, Labor hopes that we can excite future generations to enjoy the pleasure that we enjoyed so much in the sixties in that first mission to the moon.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  It's a great pleasure to talk about this bill because it's about space—'to boldly go where no-one has gone before'. That's what Australian astronomers and scientists have been doing for decades, reaching out to the stars, with their eyes, their ears and the instruments that they use, to ask the most deep and meaningful questions that human beings have always asked. Are we alone? What's out there? What are these wonders out there in the universe that light up the sky? All of us have looked up at that sky, particularly on those clear starry nights in Australia, as kids and adults. We've all dreamed those dreams about other worlds and other places in our universe and asked those fundamental questions that go to the very meaning of life and our place in it. Therefore, the work that Australian astronomers do, both amateur and professional, is so important, not just for the scientific community but for humanity as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this bill will abolish the Australian Astronomical Observatory and allow for its function to be transitioned to two consortiums to manage. The legislation will also give effect to the 2017-18 budget measure, access to world-leading astronomy infrastructure, which saw Australia sign up a strategic partnership with the European Southern Observatory. In terms of optical astronomy, the scientific community has been asking government for a number of years to explore entering into a partnership with the European Southern Observatory in order to gain access to the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is quite significant. Until recently, this access has been beyond the fiscal capability of the Australian government. But recently the ESO approached the Australian government with an offer of a 10-year strategic partnership at a cost of $119 million. Access to the telescopes at the observatory in Chile will give Australia's optical astronomy community access to the eight-metre telescope they have long been asking for. However, all of this all requires changes to the existing act that will close down the Australian Astronomical Observatory.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to state clearly that Labor will support this legislation, but we will do so somewhat reluctantly. We support the views expressed by those in the astronomy community that the best way to expand Australia's optical astronomy industry is through a partnership with the European Southern Observatory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although approval or otherwise of this legislation will not necessarily impact on the government proceeding with the ESO strategic partnership, which has already been signed and funded through the 2017-18 budget, Labor does understand that this legislation is part of the process of partnering with the ESO and that, therefore, our support is necessary. Furthermore, failure to support this bill will result in the Anglo-Australian Telescope, the AAT—not to be confused with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—and the Australian Astronomical Observatory, the AAO, in North Ryde, being unable to transfer to the university sector, resulting in their closure in July 2020 and the loss of up to 53 jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We reluctantly support this bill because it is a stopgap and not a solution. This bill does not resolve the funding cliff that has long bedevilled many areas of scientific endeavour in this country but pushes it out by another 10 years. It should also be noted that, when the ESO strategic partnership expires, the Commonwealth will need to decide whether to become a full member of the ESO, seek access for Australian science to another telescope or discontinue this area of scientific leadership our country has long enjoyed and excelled at. It will be a real shame if Australia ever discontinues this area of scientific leadership, because currently the Commonwealth works to maintain Australia's position of leadership in astronomy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science has two broad groups that manage Australia's astronomy assets in partnership with the research community. There is the Australian Square Kilometre Array Office, which is managing our engagement with the construction of the Square Kilometre Array, SKA, part of which is being built in Western Australia and the other half in South Africa. This will become the world's most advanced radio-telescope observatory. Then there is the AAO, which since 2010 has managed to access the Anglo-Australian Telescope and maintained our instrumentation capability based in North Ryde, Sydney. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will abolish the AAO as a division of the department on 1 July 2018 along with all AAO governance structures. It will allow the transfer of necessary assets to external entities, in this case the two university based consortiums. Firstly, there is the one led by the Australian National University, which transfers operations of the AAT to a consortium made up of several universities, led by the ANU, across Australia, including but not limited to Monash University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Queensland, the University of Tasmania and the University of Western Australia. The second consortium is with Macquarie University and the Australian Astronomy Limited consortium, which takes responsibility for the establishment of a national optical instrumentation capability and for the further development of the world-class instrumentation functions of the Australian Astronomical Observatory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it was constructed, the Anglo-Australian Telescope was the most advanced in the world. Its construction and operation granted the nation's scientists access to an advanced facility and allowed the development of advanced scientific and industrial techniques in Australia. While it is now 44 years old, the Anglo-Australian Telescope is still an important part of the nation's research infrastructure. Labor is relieved that the assets of the AAO will be maintained for the next seven years; however, their future beyond that date is still not resolved. The question of what happens beyond that date is key, because maintaining and strengthening Australia's position at the front line of astronomical research requires access to world-class facilities. The next generation of these facilities needed to make the next major discoveries about our universe are of such a scale and complexity that they require multinational partnerships to fund and build. That's just necessary to do that kind of work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs to ask itself what it wants from optical astronomy. Does Australia want to lead the industry? Do we want to be at the front line of research? Do we want our scientists to make discoveries about our universe? The partnership with the ESO gives Australian optical astronomers access to one of the most advanced telescopes in the world at the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile. But it leaves us floating in a vacuum after it expires. Australian astronomy has already begun the transition from a national research infrastructure portfolio of midscale Australian-owned facilities to partnership in multinational billion-dollar landmark facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are playing a critical role in two of the world's biggest billion-dollar astronomy projects: the Square Kilometre Array, which will be partly built in Australia with local industry and regional engagement; and the new Giant Magellan Telescope, which will be the first in a new class of extremely large telescopes, for which Australia is building key instrumentation. Both the GMT and the SKA present an extreme leap in telescope size. The last time a size leap of this scale happened we actually discovered planets around other stars outside of our solar system. We discovered the supermassive black hole in the centre of our galaxy and evidence that the universe is accelerating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The future is bright, but there needs to be sustained maintenance of effort and long-term security for our scientists. The Commonwealth-European Southern Observatory partnership provides for maintenance of effort for the next 10 years, but there is no certainty beyond that. Before 2028 the Commonwealth will again be obliged to decide whether to become a full member of the ESO or invest in the new GMT, which will be online by that time. So, at best, this is a medium-term stay of execution. Yet again Australian science is faced with replacing one funding cliff with a new funding cliff. So what does Australia get as a result of prolonging the inevitable funding cliff? The cost to the Commonwealth of this partnership is $119 million over the decade from 2017, or $26.1 million over the forward estimates from 2017-18 to 2020-21.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Improved access to these facilities has been a common refrain amongst astronomers for many years. <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the era of global astronomy: The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Decadal Plan for Australian Astronomy 2016-2025</span>, produced by the Academy of Science, calls for access to eight-metre-class optical astronomy infrastructure, which is currently not available in Australia. The same plan calls for maintenance of effort in terms of support for Australian domestic capability, including supporting the Australian Astronomical Observatory and its capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation that we are debating proposes to off-load the main government astronomical assets, the AAT, near Coonabarabran in New South Wales, and the AAO instrumentation, onto the Australian university sector. This is being done ostensibly to save the budget $26.1 million over the forward estimates. In reality, it's pretty much a sleight of hand—moving the burden of maintaining these facilities from the Department of Innovation, Industry and Science onto entities funded by the Department of Education and Training. This transition doesn't come without a cost. It's expected that a small number of jobs will be lost in the transition—four to five at the Anglo-Australian Telescope and up to nine at the North Ryde instrumentation laboratories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is some irony that, at a time when the government is seeking to cut university funding by $2.2 billion over the next four years, it expects universities to stump up the cash to keep these key astronomy facilities operational. We hope that they are able to remain operational, because Australia has developed a longstanding and globally recognised expertise in astronomy and we don't want to lose that leadership. We have some of the best skies in the world for astronomical observation, and our continent faces 25 per cent of space. Many people have heard of the northern lights—otherwise known as aurora borealis—but, in our own southern skies, we can bear witness to the wonders of aurora australis, the same phenomenon but in the Southern Hemisphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This abundance of sky is not lost on Australians, as we are a nation of keen amateur astronomers. Earlier this year, the country was captivated with a super blood moon, where we were treated to the three lunar phenomenon all at once: a blue moon, or a second full moon in the same calendar month; a blood moon, where the moon is in full eclipse causing the usually white moon to become red or a ruddy brown; and a super moon, where a full moon coincides with the closest distance that the moon reaches to earth in its elliptic orbit. Social media lit up when this happened that night, with people sharing their photos of the moon. Those who had less than ideal weather also posted about their disappointment that they could not actually see it. Everyone had an interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was not a one-off, either. We saw this when the ABC, in partnership with the Australian National University, led a Guinness world record attempt for the most people stargazing recently. This was to break the world record for the most people simultaneously observing the moon in the night sky through a telescope or binoculars. It was broadcast on ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Stargazing</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Live</span>, which has returned to our screens due to outstanding success last year—a real demonstration of how much Australians are engaged in and passionate about science and particularly astronomy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say that, on that basis, the evidence is pretty clear that Australians love astronomy. We have so many talented astronomers and we have many young people who look to the stars for inspiration. Yet, with this bill, we're presenting the astronomical community with a funding cliff—which has only been postponed—that not only affects our current scientists but also creates a level of uncertainty for any bright young mind that would look to the skies to help provide answers for our place in the universe. In some sense, we're hampering our ability to produce expertise. Even though Australian astronomy is world-leading and inspires thousands of Australians through citizens, science and activities, like the annual ABC stargazing, it is not backed up by the federal government with this bill. Providing a pathway where our scientists can have access to the best research infrastructure in the world is absolutely essential, but it should not come at the cost of outsourcing the existing infrastructure to a university sector that is already copping a $2.2 billion cut from the coalition government. It is an example of the government continuing to gut Australian science and the Department of Innovation, Industry and Science. We support this legislation, but we make a clear note of the cul-de-sac of uncertainty and cuts that this government has led us to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started my speech by talking about the fundamental questions that we ask when we look up to the night sky: are we alone? What's out there? What are these wonders of the universe that we dream about as kids and as adults? Astronomy is very much a part of our lives because it helps us ask those perennial human questions about who we are and our place in the universe. I will finish with a well-known farewell: 'Live long and prosper!'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  It is a privilege to sum up the Australian Astronomical Observatory (Transition) Bill 2018. I want to thank all honourable members for considering the bill and for their comments—even the reference from the member opposite to <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Trek</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars</span>. Being a bit of a sci-fi nerd, I very much appreciate your final comment there. The bill gives effect to the government's 2017-18 budget measure maintaining Australia's optical astronomy capability. In doing this, we open up a new and exciting chapter of astronomical discovery and technical innovation for this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A flagship element of this farsighted budget measure is that the Australian government has entered into a 10-year strategic partnership with the European Southern Observatory from 11 July 2017. For Australia's astronomers this changes everything. ESO is the world's foremost optical astronomy organisation—a multinational collaboration of 15 member states and host nation Chile. It offers its participants access to the world's leading-edge infrastructure, unparalleled research cooperation and collaboration, and strategic industry opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, as a strategic partner, is now an integral part of the ESO story. Our astronomers have long told us that this type of stable, long-term partnership is absolutely essential to their ability to engage in the biggest questions of science and influence the technical innovation that goes into and comes out of world-class instruments. Australia's astronomers have lost no time in making the most of their new access. In a recent competitive call for ESO observing time, Australian-led research proposals enjoyed an impressive 38 per cent success rate. That includes over 300 hours on the world's most advanced optical telescope, the eight-metre diameter very large telescope at Paranal. This is a remarkable achievement for Australia's inaugural observing period. It confirms the strong international standing of Australia's astronomers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to access to the best telescopes in the world this partnership also provides Australians with professional opportunities at ESO through jobs, fellowships and scholarships. It allows for Australians to influence the frameworks and direction of ESO through participation in its strategic governance structures. Australian research institutions can develop new optical technologies and instruments for ESO telescopes. Australia has unique strengths in this field. We have the expertise and innovation the rest of the world wants—in our robotic fibre-optic technologies, control instrument systems, software, astronomical data pipelines and archiving systems. Australian based companies and institutions can now tender for work at the ESO's Cerro Paranal observatory. Engagement with ESO will help Australian companies expand their capabilities overseas, not only in astronomy but also in space stations and other spin-off technologies that will define our world in decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ESO partnership heralds a new era of optical astronomy in our nation as we prepare for global investments and even larger telescopes that will see further into our universe. To meet this new challenge and demand, we are consolidating our optical astronomy efforts nationally. This bill provides a roadmap for that. From 1 July 2018 the key scientific operations of the Australian Astronomical Observatory will transition from the Commonwealth to the research sector. The Australian Astronomical Observatory will cease to exist in its current form, and the secretary of the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science will retain important optical astronomy powers under the Australian Astronomical Observatory Act 2010 to ensure a sound legislative basis for future government support of Australian optical astronomy initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Responsibility for operating the Anglo-Australian Telescope will transfer to the Australian National University, acting on behalf of a consortium of universities. This consortium will operate the telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Coonabarabran in New South Wales until at least the end of its extended operational life in 2024-25. This extended operational life of the telescope will provide ongoing access to Australian researchers, international consortia and the next generation of home-grown astronomers and engineers. It will also continue to benefit businesses and tourism in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Astronomical Observatory's renowned optical instrumentation capability will transfer to a second consortium led by Macquarie University, in partnership with the ANU and the University of Sydney. This consortium will continue to develop and deliver world-class instruments to overseas observatories, strengthen research industry collaboration domestically, connect the national instrumentation effort and drive the commercialisation of optical astronomy innovation in adjacent industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has worked hand-in-glove with the astronomical community here, particularly in the lead-up to the new consortium—the ANU, the Macquarie University and Astronomy Australia Limited—to ensure a positive transformation of our domestic capability. The efforts of those involved have been concerted, positive, dedicated and far-sighted. This kind of government and research sector partnership will continue to ensure a strong, sustainable foundation for future discovery that can be shared with all of our citizens. I especially acknowledge the patience, cooperation and professionalism of the staff at the Australian Astronomical Observatory in this period of considerable organisational change. The deep expertise, decades of hard work, innovation and resilience provide a strong foundation for the work to come. The government's optical astronomy measure will strengthen our research and industry opportunities in the coming decade. It will extend the legacy of the Australian Astronomical Observatory and our global reputation. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">):</span>  The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2018 is a bill about improved Medicare compliance. Labor is, of course, the party of Medicare. We invented it and we will always protect it. It is our universal public health insurance scheme. It is the heart and soul of our healthcare system and the envy of many other countries around the world. It ensures that Australians can access lifesaving treatment when they need it, without worry. More than 20 million services under Medicare are billed every year. They include GP visits, vital tests and scans and hospital treatments. It is without a doubt the most important program the Commonwealth government delivers. It's fundamental, not just to our healthcare system but to our economy and to our society. That's not to say it is perfect. With a program of this size, there are always problems and always improvements that can be made. Labor is always up for sensible improvements to Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government bill implements a 2017 budget measure to improve Medicare Benefits Schedule compliance and debt-recovery practices and will result in an estimated combined savings over the forward estimates of $103 million. That money should, of course, be reinvested straight back into Medicare in a transparent way rather than returned to the budget bottom line, but that is an issue I will return to later. This bill amends three acts: the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Dental Benefits Act 2008 and the National Health Act 1953. These technical changes will hopefully enable improved compliance by better targeting unusual business billing and improving the consistency of administrative arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to say, at the outset, that the vast majority of medical and allied health professionals that bill Medicare for services to their patients do absolutely the right thing, and provide amazing and excellent service throughout our entire community. But we also know that there are increasingly commercial interests at play in some areas, so compliance is something that we have to improve. Only 40 per cent of Medicare debts are currently recovered, meaning there is over $50 million in outstanding debt. So, obviously, there is a need for action in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in this bill clarify that the Professional Services Review, which investigates Medicare and PBS compliance concerns, has jurisdiction over corporate medical practices that contract health providers, as well as practices that employ providers and the providers themselves. The bill introduces compulsory offsetting and garnishee provisions for providers who do not voluntarily agree to repayment plans within 90 days. At present, these providers are still able to claim full Medicare benefits, even when they owe significant debts. Where a compliance debt is issued, both the employer and the contracted provider will be responsible for part of the debt, reflecting their shared responsibility for accurate billing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also makes record-keeping requirements consistent across different health professions. In particular, allied health providers will be required to keep copies of referrals for two years, just like doctors; pharmacists will be required to produce prescriptions to justify queried claims; and dentists and pharmacists will face the same administrative penalties on unpaid debts as other Medicare providers. I understand that further detail will be set out in the regulations, and that the new arrangements will start on 1 July 2019. But for now, I can say that Labor will be supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like I said, we are always willing to support sensible improvements to Medicare. But we don't support the government's overall approach when it comes to Medicare, and I'll be moving a second reading amendment to that effect. It took two Labor governments more than two decades to shape and embed the Medicare that we know today. Many Australians take Medicare for granted, and that is as it should be. They should be able to rely on Medicare whenever they need it, without worry and without a second thought. But let's never forget that the conservatives opposed Medicare every single step of the way. Labor had a hard fight to set it up and now we continue to have a hard fight to protect it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot trust this government when it comes to Medicare. They talk about a 'rock solid' commitment to it, but we all know the truth: they deeply, deeply don't like it. They want to dismantle it. They just don't believe in universal health care like the Labor Party does. They dream of an Americanised health system where it is every man, woman and child for themselves—where people increasingly have to rely on private means to access health care. Every step of the way and every measure, that is what they have been doing. This is where people suffer for years because they cannot afford to see a doctor or go to hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time the conservatives get into power they attempt to dismantle Medicare, either up-front or, more lately, by stealth. That is what they do. We have a system in this country now where, increasingly, you have to rely on your private means to access health care. That is what this government has delivered to the health care of this nation.</span>

The fact that the government has decimated it and continues to do that every day is something that should be called out. They might behave themselves for a little while when it comes to Medicare, but we actually know how much the Australian people need Medicare. Those opposite might agree for a little while, but we know that they constantly undermine this system.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. Of course, we know that this government was planning to outsource parts of the Medicare system to the private sector. Labor staunchly and vehemently opposed that move. In the two years since that election, the government has been busy trying to rewrite history, pretending that that somehow didn't actually happen, that they weren't planning to do that, that they hadn't commenced the work—nor was it in their budget papers, which it was—that somehow this was a Labor invention, that it was a scare campaign. That is utter nonsense. The government was actively planning to outsource the Medicare payment system to a corporate player—one of the big four banks, perhaps, or a private health fund. That is what this government was doing. If we had let them get away with it, that would have been the beginning of the end for Medicare as we know it. The government dropped their plan because of Labor's tireless efforts to highlight the damage that they had done to our healthcare system and because the Australian people agreed that it was a terrible plan and punished them for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eventually, as we know, the Liberals will have another crack. They'll come up with another scheme to undermine, weaken or sell off parts of Medicare, because they have form. Remember their $7 co-payment from just a few years ago. It was an unprecedented attack on the universality and accessibility of Medicare, effectively meaning that we would have a system where people were increasingly having to pay substantial out-of-pocket costs for Medicare. Then, too, it was Labor, it was the parliament, it was the Australian people who ultimately stopped the government from going down that road. As is so often the case, we helped save the government from itself, but the plan revealed what was in their hearts. When they couldn't get that plan through, they resorted to extending the freeze on Medicare rebates—a freeze that is still in place today—for six years. Again, under intense pressure from Labor, doctors and the public, the minister announced a thaw in that freeze in the budget last year. But, today, there still hasn't been a single element of it lifted. Some elements will come off as of 1 July, delivering GPs a 55c increase in the Medicare rebate for patients. It won't put a dent in the soaring out-of-pocket costs, and other elements of the freeze will stay in place until 2020. That's six years of slugging doctors and, ultimately, patients who simply want to access health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rebate freeze has saved the government billions of dollars, and they're still banking those savings from patient rebates today. That is billions of dollars that should have gone into providing health care in this nation. Meanwhile, the latest Medicare data shows that the cost of seeing both GPs and specialists is at record highs because of those Liberal cuts. In the first three months of 2018, Australians paid an average out-of-pocket fee of $38.44 to see a GP and nearly $47 in some states and territories. The national figures have risen nearly $4 from $34.53 cents at the end of July 2017. Out-of-pocket fees to see specialists have soared even higher, up to an average of $87.62 in the March quarter. That's up from $71.75 in the last three months of 2017—up nearly $16 in just a single quarter. In some jurisdictions, the average out-of-pocket cost of seeing a specialist has now soared to well above $90. These are the average costs. They are far too high. Meanwhile, the government has tried to trumpet funding for the projected growth in Medicare service usage as, somehow, a record investment in Medicare. The Australian people are far too smart to fall for that. They know that the cost of going to see a doctor has risen under this government. They feel it every time they get sick or injured and need to access health care. That's why so many of them are delaying going to see a doctor. Official Bureau of Statistics figures show that one million Australians delay or avoid seeing their GP each year due to cost, with another 1.7 million Australians skipping specialist appointments. About the same number don't fill prescriptions because of cost. Older Australians fare worse, with one in eight telling the Commonwealth Fund that they have problems getting care because of cost. Only patients in the US—obviously no role model for us when it comes to universal health care—fare worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have always been challenges with Medicare's universality, such as the difficulty of accessing services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as well as for people in regional, rural and remote Australia, but, in recent years, out-of-pocket costs have become a significant barrier to universal access. Medicare statistics show that, 10 years ago, Australians paid an average out-of-pocket fee of $21 to see a GP. If that cost had increased in line with inflation, it would be around $26 today. The same is true for specialists. Ten years ago, Australians paid $44, equivalent to around $54 today, yet the Liberals make the laughable claim that Medicare has never been stronger. What rot. Whether it's making Medicare more expensive, cutting public hospitals or putting private health insurance profits before patients, the conservatives can never be trusted when it comes to our universal health insurance system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last round of budget Senate estimates, officials said that the government's latest budget was trying to bend the curve of Medicare—that's their fancy new way of saying 'a cut to costs'. This government wants to bend Medicare, basically, until it breaks. In stark contrast, the Leader of the Opposition announced the first of Labor's new investments in Medicare in his budget-in-reply, and that is a significant investment in MRIs. Unlike other diagnostic imaging services, MRI scans can only attract a rebate if they're performed with an eligible machine. The licence system is difficult, but it worked relatively well until 2013, given that the last Labor government granted over 238 licences. Unfortunately, the current government has neglected MRIs, granting only four licences in almost five years. That is a woeful record when you know that there are communities across the country who are desperately seeking access to this diagnostic technology and are having to pay substantial amounts of money to do so. It is a woeful record. As a result, access to Medicare MRIs is patchy, with many Australians travelling long distances or experiencing significant wait times to access an eligible machine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's Senate inquiry into MRI licences heard evidence that in some primary health networks people are waiting an average of 50 days for an MRI after a specialist referral. That is too long. The inquiry also heard that a shortage of Medicare MRI licences could have deadly consequences, with evidence that children were being overexposed to the radiation of CT scans. That's why we announced that we will grant 20 new full MRI licences. The first 10 will be reserved for public hospitals, with locations determined based on evidence from Senate estimates and from advice from state governments and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already announced that the first licence we intend to deliver is in Western Australia, with the community of Kalgoorlie to benefit from that. I do note the pretty appalling evidence that has come to light, that this government was prepared to trade an MRI licence for the people of Kalgoorlie for a vote in the Senate for its $80 billion worth of tax cuts—an appalling indictment of the way that this government does business when it comes to health. The remaining 10 licences from Labor will be awarded via a transparent application process under a Labor government. This will be the first opportunity for communities around Australia to apply for a licence since Labor was last in office. This $80 million investment will ensure that more communities have affordable access to life-saving scans. We've also said that Labor would re-invest into Medicare every dollar saved from the clinician-led MBS review. That is because we see the MBS review as an opportunity to improve innovation in Medicare, not as a cost-cutting exercise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making the claim that it will re-invest or redirect its savings back into the Health portfolio overall, but we on this side simply do not trust a single word that this government says when it comes to Medicare. The government's assurances are absolutely worthless. So, while there is $190 million in savings from the MBS review in the 2018 budget, there is just $25 million in new MBS listings, which means a net cut to Medicare. The minister is seeking to claim that putting money into the projected usage of Medicare services is somehow investing in new innovation in Medicare and investing all of the savings from the MBS review back into Medicare. It is not.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is certainly not going into our hospitals, either. After four years of Abbott-Turnbull cuts to our public hospitals, Australia's public hospitals are in trouble. This government cut Medicare, they've cut public hospitals and they do everything they can to prop up the big private insurers. That is the Liberal Party's vision for health care in this country. Labor, of course, will have more to say about new investments in Medicare in the months ahead.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the government will have two amendments that it will be moving to its own bill. The first is to resolve a drafting error to ensure existing debts can be recovered, and the second is to clarify that it is not the intention of the changes to PSR summons to see individual practitioners being subject to multiple penalties for nonappearance. Labor will support both of these amendments, but I do note that the government's approach has been very sloppy here. One would be warranted in thinking that maybe they are rushing things through a bit in an attempt to clear the decks before an election. As I signalled before, we will be supporting this bill, but, given the contribution to the debate, I move:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2018 and to support the amendment moved by the member for Ballarat. This bill implements a 2017 budget measure to improve Medicare Benefits Schedule compliance and debt recovery practices, and will result in an estimated combined savings over the forward estimates of $103 million. This bill amends three acts: the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Dental Benefits Act 2008 and the National Health Act 1953. These technical changes will hopefully lead to improved compliance by better targeting unusual business billing and improving the consistency of administrative arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a health professional myself—I am a pharmacist, and the only pharmacist in this House—I know that the vast majority of medical and allied health professionals that bill Medicare for services to their patients do the right thing. But we know there are increasingly commercial interests in play in some areas, so compliance needs to be improved. Only 40 per cent of Medicare debts are currently recovered, and there is over $50 million in outstanding debt, so there is a need for action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes clarify that the Professional Services Review, which investigates Medicare and PBS compliance concerns, has jurisdiction over corporate medical practices that contract health providers, as well as practices that employ providers and the providers themselves. It introduces compulsory offsetting and garnishee provisions for providers who does not voluntarily agree to repayment plans within 90 days. At present, these providers are still able to claim full Medicare benefits even when they owe significant debts. Where a compliance debt is issued, both the employer and the contracted provider will be responsible for part of the debt, reflecting their shared responsibility for accurate billing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also makes record-keeping requirements consistent across different health professions. In particular, allied health providers will be required to keep copies of referrals for two years, just like doctors. Pharmacists like myself will be required to provide prescriptions to justify queried claims. Dentists and pharmacists will face the same administrative penalties on unpaid debts as other Medicare providers. Further detail will be set out in regulations, and the new arrangements will start on 1 July 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the main reasons I'm in this House is my 20 years working in health, my 15 years in mental health and the last 10 years I spent at Wyong Hospital, working in the inpatient mental health units. I'm proud to be a member of the Labor Party—the Labor Party that introduced Medicare and will always properly fund and support Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is about universal health care. It's about every Australian, wherever they live, whatever they earn, being able to afford health care when they need it and access it where they need it. The Labor Party is always willing to support sensible improvements to Medicare. The Labor Party is justly proud of its work over many decades to create, properly fund and properly protect Medicare. It is our universal public health system, the foundation of our healthcare system, the pillar that underpins universal access to health care in Australia and the envy of many countries around the world. It means Australians can access life-saving treatment and life-saving medications when they need them, and it means that they can afford them. More than 20 million Australians access Medicare services every year, including GP visits, vital tests and scans, and hospital treatments, and it is without a doubt one of the most important programs the Commonwealth government delivers. It is fundamental not just to our health system but to our economy and our society. It took two Labor governments more than two decades to shape and establish the Medicare that we know and benefit from today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians don't know what health care in Australia was like before Medicare. My colleague Dr Mike Freelander is here in this House because he knows, and that was one of the things that drove him to stand for parliament. He didn't want to end his career with children not being able to access health services that they need, as it was when he started his career. People should be able to rely on Medicare whenever they need it, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances. Let's not forget that the conservatives opposed Medicare each and every step of the way. Labor had to fight hard to set it up, and now we fight hard to protect it. Official Bureau of Statistics figures show that one million Australians delay or avoid seeing a GP each year due to cost, with another 1.7 million Australians skipping specialist appointments. About the same number don't fill a prescription because of cost. As a pharmacist and someone who's worked in health for 20 years, this really troubles me. Older Australians fare the worst, with one in eight telling the Commonwealth Fund that they have problems getting care because of cost. This is only made worse by delays with My Aged Care and Centrelink and the problems we've seen recently with homecare packages and residential care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have always been challenges to Medicare's universality, such as the difficulty of accessing services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as well as people in regional and rural communities and remote Australia. But in recent years, out-of-pocket costs have become a significant barrier to access. Medicare statistics show that 10 years ago Australians paid an average out-of-pocket fee of $21 to see a GP. If that cost had increased in line with inflation, it would be around $26 today, and we know that's not the case. The last Medicare data shows the cost of seeing both GPs and specialists is at a record high. In the first three months of 2018, Australians paid an average out-of-pocket fee of $38.44 to see a GP, up to nearly $47 in some states and territories. The national figure has risen nearly $4, from $44.53 at the end of 2017. The same is true for specialists. Ten years ago, Australians paid $44, which would be equivalent to around $54 today. Out-of-pocket fees to see specialists have soared even higher than those for GP visits, up to an average of $87.62 in the March quarter. Recently, my sister, who's expecting her second child, had to see a neurologist. The up-front cost was $400. That's just out of reach for most Australians. In some jurisdictions, the average out-of-pocket cost of seeing a specialist is now well above $90.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How has this happened? How have we landed here? Well, remember when the Liberals tried to introduce the $7 co-payment? That was an unprecedented attack on Medicare and access to Medicare, effectively trying to end bulk-billing. When they couldn't get that plan through, they resorted to extending their freeze on Medicare rebates. That freeze is still in place today. Again, under intense pressure from Labor, doctors and the public, Minister Hunt announced a thaw in the freeze in May 2017, but he still hasn't actually lifted a single element of it. Some elements will finally be lifted on 1 July, delivering GPs a paltry 55c increase in the rebate. That won't have much impact on soaring out-of-pocket costs, and other elements of the freeze will stay in place until 2020. That's six years of slugging doctors and, ultimately, patients simply because they need care. The rebate freeze has saved the government billions of dollars, and they're still banking those savings right now. That is billions of dollars that should've gone to providing health care, not paying for tax cuts for big business and big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the government is out there trying to portray a static GP bulk-billing rate as some kind of achievement. The Australian people are too smart for this spin. They know that the cost of going to the doctor has gone up. They feel it every time they get sick or injured and every time they get a prescription filled. That's why so many of them are delaying going to the doctor, delaying urgent treatment from their GP. Yet the Liberals claim that Medicare has never been stronger. Whether it's making Medicare more expensive, cutting public hospitals or trying to sell them off, as they attempted to do to Wyong hospital in my community on the Central Coast, the conservatives can never be trusted with our health care. You just can't trust them with Medicare. They keep talking about their rock-solid commitment to it, but we all know the truth: they want to dismantle it. They just don't believe in universal health care like we do. They look to health systems like in America, where people increasingly have to rely on private means to access health care, where people suffer for years because they can't afford to see a doctor, go to a hospital or get medication, and where you have to get out your credit card rather than your Medicare card whenever you visit the doctor or pay for medication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They might say what they think the public wants to hear, because they know how much the Australian people value Medicare. It underpins health care in Australia. Australians certainly sent that message loud and clear at the last election, when the government was plotting to outsource parts of Medicare to the private sector. Labor, of course, opposed that move. In the two years since the election, the government has been busy trying to rewrite history, pretending it was all a scare campaign—but we all know that's nonsense. The public knows it's nonsense. This government was actively planning to outsource the Medicare payment system to a corporate player—one of the big four banks, perhaps, or a private health fund. If we had let them get away with it, that would have been the beginning of the end of Medicare. The government only dropped their plan because of Labor's tireless efforts to highlight the damage it would have done to our health system and because the Australian people agreed it wasn't a good plan and punished the government for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eventually, as we all know, the Liberals will have another crack. They'll come up with another scheme to undermine or weaken or sell off parts of Medicare. In stark contrast, in his budget reply speech the Leader of the Opposition announced the first of Labor's new investments in Medicare—a significant investment in MRIs. Unlike other diagnostic imaging services, MRI scans only attract a Medicare rebate if they are performed on an eligible machine. The licence system worked relatively well until 2013, given that the last Labor government granted 238 licences. Unfortunately, the current government has neglected MRIs, granting only four MRI licences in almost five years in office. Labor established Medicare. Labor will always defend Medicare. Labor will properly fund health care for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude by again going back to my community and to the hospital that I worked in, in Wyong, on the New South Wales Central Coast. In communities like mine, where there are pockets of extreme disadvantage, people need to know that they can trust and rely on being able to access healthcare services. In my work, particularly in mental health and working in inpatient units in public hospitals, I have seen the most vulnerable people in our community, people whose circumstances are such that they are unable to care for themselves. These are the people that we need to protect. These are the people that we need to support. Undermining Medicare sends a strong signal to these people that the government doesn't care and thinks that these people don't matter. And this is a real risk. People need to feel secure. People need to know that they will be able to see their GP. They need to know that they will be able to go to their psychiatrist and be able to afford it. They need to know they will be able to get their prescription filled and get other treatments that they need. This is something that really matters; it matters to all Australians. As a pharmacist and a mental healthcare worker, and as someone who is new to this House, I feel that we really need to make sure that Medicare is always properly funded, and Labor will always do that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I want to thank all of the speakers to this bill. The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2018 amends the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Dental Benefits Act 2008 and the National Health Act 1953 to implement measures announced in the 2017 budget. These measures will support the integrity of Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and will strengthen Medicare as part of a broader package that includes record funding for Medicare, each year, every year; record funding for hospitals, each year, every year; and record bulk-billing levels, up 3.8 per cent since we came to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are supported by our historic compacts with the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. These compacts reflect shared principles that support a stronger, sustainable health system, including improved compliance processes to ensure Medicare overpayments are detected and recovered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the majority of health practitioners claim Medicare benefits appropriately, a very small number of practitioners do not. Where inappropriate claims are made—again, I emphasise that it is a rare and infrequent occurrence, not reflective of the extraordinary general practitioner population—some practitioners refuse to agree to repayment arrangements, yet they are still able to claim benefits through Medicare. In these cases, the amendments will allow future bulk-billed claims to be reduced or offset by up to 20 per cent until the debt is recovered. For those practitioners who do not bulk-bill, the amendments will allow garnisheeing of other funds owed to them if they do not enter into a repayment plan within 90 days. No patients will be affected by these arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note there has been an increase in the role of practices, corporate entities and hospitals in the billing of MBS services on behalf of the individual practitioner. The amendments ensure that where these arrangements exist both the practitioner and their employer, or other related party, are responsible for the repayment of the debt. This change represents a significant shift, moving to a fairer distribution of the liability for debt, and is supported by key stakeholders, including the AMA and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2018 provides additional safeguards to protect doctors. Through further consultation, the AMA identified that proposed changes to the Professional Services Review Scheme may have had the unintended consequence of subjecting a practitioner to both disqualification from billing Medicare and a possible criminal prosecution for failing to attend in accordance with summons. This is not the intent. We have listened and we will therefore amend the bill accordingly. The amendment bill will also ensure that existing debts owed to the Commonwealth can be recovered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the members for their contributions to the debate on this bill and in particular the AMA and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and other proponents within the health sector for their support and assistance with this bill. I also want to thank the opposition for their support. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  What is it with the out-of-control New South Wales state government? Every time they decide we need something new in Parramatta, every time they decide for us without consulting us, they take away something valued and loved. We knew they planned to move the Powerhouse Museum to Parramatta, but we hadn't seen the business case, the previously secret business case. Now we have and we find yet other absurdity. It turns out the state government is going to demolish eight heritage-listed properties in order to build a museum of heritage. To build a museum of heritage it is going to knock down eight heritage buildings! It makes no sense at all, and it makes even less sense when you realise that part of the site will be sold for a commercial megatower to make the museum more viable. Willow Grove, a gorgeous old house that we all know in Phillip Street, was built in the 1870s and it is there, including its front yard and heritage listed fence and gates. St George's Terrace, just up the road, was built in 1881. It was converted to a hospital when the influenza pandemic swept across in 1919. It is one of the last remaining heritage homes in the CBD, and we love it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the state government: leave it alone. Stop destroying things that we love that tell our story. Give us our community and the Australian stories that unfolded in our region some respect. Hands off our heritage.</span>

I see this in all my interactions with local schools, and it was reaffirmed when earlier this month I hosted my annual lunch for year 12 school leaders. I was joined by 20 school captains and student leaders from 11 local high schools. The lunch was a small way for me to acknowledge their leadership within their school communities. Under the pressure of year 12 it is a considerable extra responsibility to serve as a school captain or student leader, and they do an incredible job. The gathering was an opportunity for us to discuss the issues that they feel most strongly about. We talked about matters ranging from climate change to women in STEM. I should also report that a common theme was their hope to see more civility and consensus in Australian politics, a message we could all do well to heed.</span>

They are a fine group of leaders with big futures ahead of them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  In a week where Eurydice Dixon's tragic death has united the country in grief and outrage, I would like to speak about a tragedy no less heart-wrenching that happened on the borders of my electorate last week. Justin was a five-year-old boy who lived in Carlingford and attended Carlingford Public School in my electorate. Last week his life was cut short when he was stabbed and killed by his father. By all accounts, the father loved his son deeply and had been trying to get into mental health facilities in the days prior to the attack but was turned away. I'm sure the House will join me in sharing our deepest sorrow for the boy's family, including his distraught mother and his grandmother, who found him and nursed him as they tried to take him to hospital. This is a tragedy that should never have happened and will leave a permanent mark on this family.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this awful time, the local community has banded together, led by Carlingford Public School Principal Neil Hinton, who has been coordinating the tributes. A GoFundMe page has been set up by local families to help the boy's mother meet the costs of the funeral, which will be held this week. If you too have been moved by this awful situation and would like to donate, please contact my office on (02)98694288 to get the details of this page. Thank you.</span>

We on this side of the House are pleased to welcome TAFE teachers, and others who work in this sector, to the building today, because we've got a lot to celebrate—going forward, if this side of the House takes government. Let's face it, in the fifth year of this LNP government, there's just been bad news for TAFE, very bad news. We've had campuses closed all over the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like most Australians, I'm appalled when I hear that Australia is importing tradespeople in traditional trades at the cost of our local Australian kids. I'm appalled when business says we've got a skills shortage in bricklaying. We haven't got a skills shortage in bricklaying; we've got a shortage in commitment from the other side. For five years, we've had a shortage of commitment. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have great plans for TAFE. We're going to spend $100 million modernising TAFE facilities. Two of every three dollars of Commonwealth priority training dollars will be spent on TAFE filling Australian apprenticeships. One on 10 jobs in Commonwealth priority projects will be filled by Australian apprentices. There will be 10,000 pre-apprenticeships and 20,000 adult apprenticeships, and that's on top of the 100,000 training positions that we will pay for. It will be a great day for TAFE—sometime in the future when that government is gone from those benches. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Last week I had the great pleasure of joining the local mayor of Scenic Rim, Greg Christensen, and a number of councillors, at Jubilee Park, to welcome no less than 12 new Australian citizens to our community. Many have lived in our region for many, many years and have come from vast and very different backgrounds; however, one interest that they all shared was they all wanted to become proud Australians and share in our Australian values and our rich history, to defend and protect our hard-fought-for freedoms, and to embrace all that it means to be an Australian. We are all proud people, having survived and thrived as a nation following the cruelty of wars, depressions, droughts and floods. The 12 new Australians who received their citizenships are now part of the great story. I officially welcome each of them as proud Australians. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beaudesert residents also enjoyed a fantastic day of fun, market stalls and activities as part of the Scenic Rim's Queensland Day celebrations. The Scenic Rim community celebrated Queensland's 159th birthday, complete with a birthday cake and songs. The celebration went on well into the afternoon and included displays, stalls from local services and communities groups, performances by artists, students and dance groups. In the spirit of Queensland Day and with the State of Origin looming, all I have left to say is: go the Queenslanders, go the maroons—and I acknowledge some proud Queenslanders up in the gallery. </span>

It is a day to reflect on how this government has failed TAFEs and TAFE students across the country. Since forming government in 2013, this government, the Liberal-Nationals, have cut $3 billion from TAFE apprenticeships and vocational education in our country, including $270 million in this budget alone. What is the result of these massive cuts to TAFE? We have seen 140,000 apprenticeships in this country lost. We have seen TAFE campuses close. We have seen courses lost. The member for Lalor mentioned bricklaying. That is one of the courses that was cut at Bendigo TAFE when this government cut funding to Bendigo TAFE. What do we have today? Because of cuts to courses like bricklaying, we now have a skills shortage in this country—because of this government's reckless attitude towards TAFE. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some of the issues we have. In National Party areas, where youth unemployment can be as high as 20 per cent, we have seen TAFE campuses close and we are seeing courses lost. It is a disgrace. Today, on TAFE Day, we acknowledge the hardworking TAFE teachers, we acknowledge the state Labor governments who are trying to reverse the damage that has been done and we call upon this government to stop attacking TAFE and, instead, to reinvest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  A story that shall stay with me forever occurred during the 2016 federal election campaign. I spoke with an elderly resident of Mount Waverley, a suburb in the heart of the electorate of Chisholm. This lovely man was emotionally distraught. Five days prior to my speaking with him, his wife had been diagnosed with cancer. A few days later, in the dead of night, he took a phone call from someone, likely a Labor union campaign worker, who said to him that the Liberals were going to sell Medicare. 'Tell me it's not true, Julia,' he said, the emotion palpable in his voice. I spent a good half an hour reassuring him that Medicare was guaranteed, and wished him my very warmest wishes for his wife's recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor followed up this landline telephone campaign designed to attack the elderly with a text message on election day to thousands of Australians—and they were impersonating Medicare. Labor's 'Mediscare' campaign was a blatant, cruel, deceptive lie and political propaganda of the worst kind. It also did harm and incited very real emotional fear in people. All Australians, like this lovely resident, will now be protected from such deliberately deceptive behaviour with the passing of laws that make it a criminal offence to impersonate a Commonwealth entity. Labor should reflect on their disgusting behaviour with respect to 'Mediscare' and the irony of them now supporting the passing of legislation that would regard Labor's 'Mediscare' actions and tactics as a criminal offence.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  The 22nd Alexandra Truck Ute &amp; Rod Show was held on the Queen's Birthday long weekend and it was bigger than ever. Over 200 trucks, 40 utes and 25 hot rods were on display and there was a major quilt exhibition. The show attracted over 13,000 people. I want to sing out to volunteer community members, including founders Andrew Embling and Gordon Simpson and chairman Ayden Embling—it really is a family business. They made it all possible. Originally established to offer something to the local community on the long weekend, this show has grown into a major tourism drawcard creating an economic benefit of more than $1.7 million for the greater Alexandra area. And the show continues to give back to community organisations, with the raffle of a truck that is hoping to raise over a million dollars for the Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Service Teen Challenge. So, warm congratulations and a huge call out to all the people of Alex. You do a fantastic job. The Alexandra Truck Ute &amp; Rod Show is a great example of how dedicated volunteers extend their effort, make our community a wonderful place to live in, create economic and social capital but, most of all, provide a really good activity for our community. I am so proud to represent you here. Well done to all the Alex community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  In January I was privileged, if that is the word, to go and inspect the refugee camps of the Rohingya crisis in Cox's Bazar. I had a walk around there and saw the very worst and the very best of humanity. We saw people doing whatever they could to help 700,000 refugees who had fled Myanmar and were in tent accommodation—dealing with water, toilets, medicine and accommodation. The monsoon season was coming at that stage. Because the land was denuded to make room for these people, they were very concerned about mudslides. I want to update the House that the monsoon season has now hit. There are some really challenging situations in those camps at the moment. They still have up to 180,000 people who are at risk of death from mudslides. The pressure on sanitation in that makeshift accommodation is huge, particularly for women.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians should be proud of Australia's contribution. We are the third biggest contributor to dealing with this crisis in our region. The next challenge will be to create economic zones so that we can integrate the Rohingya in the community there. The Australian government is doing a fair bit and we should be proud of it. There is certainly going to be more to do as the monsoon season impacts those people at this time.</span>

The latest one is 'jobs and growth'. Do you know what you need for jobs and growth? You need skilled workers. The challenge is skills now and skills in the future. Industry say they can't find enough skilled people in this country. With the unemployment rate the way it is, it is astounding that that is the case. We will need skills in the future because of what technology will do in terms of jobs. Knowing these two challenges, what are we confronted with? We've had $3 billion ripped out of skills development in this country since the coalition has been in. If that's not enough, they want to rip out another $300 million.</span>

What we're also saying is that we on the Labor side back TAFE. We will scrap up-front fees for 100,000 people wanting to use TAFE. We will modernise TAFE facilities, particularly in rural and regional areas. We will provide more opportunities for Australian apprentices. We'll also make sure that we give older workers the opportunity to retrain. It is about backing people in this country. TAFE is the flagship skills development authority in this country. It is time we backed them, not kept cutting their funds.</span>

It has led him to write his second book, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Korumburra </span><span style="font-style:italic;">&amp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> District: Road Names and Places History</span>, which I recently had the pleasure of launching at Coal Creek historical park in Korumburra. This was an eight-year project for Bob in gathering and detailing the stories of local families and local roads. The book launch was a testament to the community's respect for Bob, with the room filled with family, friends, community members and local history buffs. Bob's book is about not only an individual's love for the district, its people and its families but also the stories and histories of the region. With over 500 streets, roads and lanes detailed—in many cases including photographs of the pioneering families—Bob's book covers the accidents, the challenges and the sacrifices that went into setting up the South Gippsland region as we know it today. Bob is to be congratulated on the publication of this book. But Bob's not done with writing books yet; he has other books planned, including the history of the street names of Mirboo North, Foster, Leongatha and Inverloch. I think his wife, Marilyn, has had a lot to put up with over these last eight years!</span>

Of course, when you look at them, you can't help but think about the sort of future that they're going to face, a future in which they will need skills and training in order to be able to get the jobs that will exist in that future. But today, on National TAFE Day, we should also be reflecting on the $3 billion in cuts to vocational education and training that this government has made since they have been in. We should be reflecting on the fact that there are 140,000 fewer apprenticeships in this country than there were when this government got in. In my electorate, there has been a drop of 40 per cent in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships that have been undertaken across the period that the coalition have been in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's cuts to vocational education are bad for young people. They're also bad for people already in the workforce who'll want to retrain and reskill in the future as more and more change happens in our economy. There have to be genuine opportunities for lifelong learning, training and redevelopment in this country. Cutting vocational education is the opposite of what the Commonwealth should be doing. Labor will support vocational education. Labor will support properly funding TAFE. Labor will support properly fixing up the equipment available to people in vocational education. We want to support opportunities for apprenticeships. We want to support opportunities for older workers to retrain so that they can also have the skills they need for the jobs of the future. National TAFE Day is a great opportunity to recognise the importance of TAFE.</span>

Students in biology, maths and various other STEM subjects were all here, having been chosen from competitions in this country to make teams to go overseas for this very prestigious international competition. It was good that the Chief Scientist of Australia, Dr Alan Finkel, along with the Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation, Senator Seselja, was there to make all the announcements to these worthy young representatives from the scholarly future of Australia of their progress to go overseas.</span>

Marcellin College is one of the great secondary schools in my electorate, partly because one of my daughters teaches there. It's been a great school for many decades, and it's great that Stephen has been chosen to go to Portugal later this year to participate in the Australian team. To all of the students who were here yesterday, congratulations on your efforts to date and our very best wishes in your competitions to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Today is National TAFE Day. TAFE is a great national asset, and it has been for decades and for generations of Australians. It is our vocational education public provider, and we know so well that the words 'public provider' leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those opposite—as, for example, the ABC knows only too well. TAFE needs to remain a national asset—there for young Australians, there for restructured workers, there for regional and rural communities, there to ensure that people have a future in an ever-changing world—and it has had nothing but attacks from those opposite. They can barely bring themselves to say the word 'TAFE', to be honest with you, unless they're cutting funding from it—$3 billion since they came to government. TAFE must be sustainable. Only Labor has a plan for that, committing two out of every three dollars to our public provider. It must be accessible. We must make sure all people who have the capacity and interest get opportunity, and we are backing 100,000 places at TAFE for those people. It must be respected. It needs to be seen as an important part of post-secondary education, and Labor is doing the work to get a full review into an effective system that delivers for post-secondary education. We back our TAFEs; we back our teachers and our students and our communities. Those opposite have a disgraceful history and it should not be forgotten on National TAFE Day. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  The banking royal commission has exposed a lot of bad behaviour, but, given the chance to dig deep, it would find that ulterior motives drove deliberately dodgy behaviour by the banks. In 2009, McKinsey and Company published a bad-bank strategy template which detailed the rationale, benefits and processes for banks to dump unwanted business loans. The Commonwealth Bank clearly adopted this strategy with a very senior CBA executive stating:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bankwest story is very much an intentional one. We have deliberately got out of low credit quality lending in this space and on an annualised basis in fact our reduction in the target, low credit quality space is well over 20%.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bankwest loans were dumped, even though borrowers never missed a payment, simply because the CBA wanted to change its risk profile. Further investigations will reveal evidence the bank followed the bad-bank strategy, overriding grade systems to push down risk ratings, reducing property values to trigger non-monetary defaults, falsifications of documents and forgery. I support the small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell, in her call to extend the commission's time to investigate small business loans. It would be a tragically lost opportunity if the full extent of the deliberate dodgy practices were not exposed. I call on the government to grant the royal commission more time to investigate issues around small business lending so we can fix this problem. Small businesses were victims of the banks because of deliberate dodgy practices.</span>

Not only is it National TAFE Day and not only did I have the pleasure of meeting fantastic representatives of TAFE: Phillip Smith, a TAFE teacher from Victoria; Valerie Lester, a parent and TAFE teacher from Victoria; and Alanna Dennien, an apprentice and TAFE student from Queensland who is studying heavy diesel mechanics—I don't know if Alanna is in the gallery yet, but she is going to take over the world, I reckon; she's a fantastic young woman—but earlier today we had the first meeting of Labor's post-secondary school review, where we're talking about the type of TAFE system and the type of university system that Australia needs for the future. We're casting forward to think about what the workforce of 2040 will be like. Children born this year will experience a whole different world of work to the one that we are looking at today: different jobs, different skills needed and different knowledge. Certainly, they will need genuine lifelong learning with upgrading and updating of skills and knowledge right through their working lives, and TAFE is in a position to do that if we get the funding right. Those opposite have cut $3 billion from TAFE and apprenticeships and training since coming to government and there are 140,000 fewer apprentices today than when they came to office. We have to protect and value TAFE, not destroy it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Social and financial disadvantage is prevalent right across Australia, despite our best efforts as a community to prevent it. In Dunkley, we are incredibly fortunate to have an amazing network of volunteers who provide meals to the homeless and disadvantaged in the absence of City Life, which unfortunately, was unable to continue. Locally, I am working with a number of providers to find a long-term solution to provide meals to the homeless, particularly via Chisholm TAFE. Luckily, a number of local organisations have stepped up to meet the demand. One of these groups is Life-Gate, whom I recently secured $10,500 for, through the Stronger Communities program, for a mobile food trailer. The tireless volunteers who patrol our streets at night to provide the disadvantaged with free meals will now have access to a trailer that is fully equipped with a barbecue, a coffee machine, soup vats, storage for table and chairs, an extendable awning and a generator. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very proud to officially launch the Meals for Change trailer, bringing to a close the funding campaign supported by Karingal Hub, Bayside Shopping Centre, Frankston Business Network, St Kilda Football Club, Frankston City Council and the community through a GoFundMe campaign. I'm so proud of the way everyone has pulled together in the spirit of community. I congratulate Reverend Angel Roldan, Pastor Ulli Roldan, Lauren Hornby and others at Life-Gate for their terrific efforts to secure the Meals for Change trailer. </span>

I come from generations of tradespeople—shipwrights, boilermakers, printers and fitters and turners—so I find one of the great privileges of being a member of parliament the opportunity is visiting TAFE campuses around our nation. My colleagues and I get to meet TAFE educators, passing on their knowledge and inspiring others. We get to watch young Australians discovering what they can do and falling in love with the passions they can take through their lives. We get to see older workers retraining for a new opportunity, finding the confidence that comes from starting something new. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that at the next election there will be a very clear choice on TAFE: another three years of Liberal cuts to TAFE and apprenticeships or a Labor government backing public TAFE all the way. We will invest $100 million in rebuilding TAFE to renovate campuses and workshops, we'll hire more apprentices on Commonwealth projects—one in every 10 employees must be an apprentice—and we're going to waive up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want us to be a nation that simply relies on importing skilled workers when we can train our own. Where a town has a TAFE, a community has hope in the future; and, when public TAFE is strong and properly funded, we'll have a highly skilled workforce earning good wages, we'll have an economy that can compete and succeed in Asia and above all we'll have an Australia where no-one gets left behind. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  On Friday, 8 June, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, hosted MINCO here in Canberra. This was attended by the water ministers of the Murray-Darling states of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. One of the biggest issues has been the definition of the term, 'neutral or improved socioeconomic outcomes' as stated in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in relation to the delivery of 450 gigalitres of up water. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This definition sits in the plan in section 717. Clearly, the definition is an economic test only. In plain English, the definition of 'socioeconomic' in the Cambridge dictionary is related to differences between groups of people caused mainly by their financial situation. It has now been accepted that a definition has to be acknowledged as including the impact of communities, towns and regions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the intent of the plan has to be thought through and we have to deliver on what was the intent of the plan, as read out by Tony Burke in this place, then the minister for water, and as put into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> by the opposition leader Barnaby Joyce. With the Murray-Darling Basin Plan coming to its seventh year, hindsight now shows that considerable negative socioeconomic impacts have been caused. We now have an opportunity to secure the future of the irrigators of the Murray-Darling Basin, and this flow-on effect will make sure we secure the growth of the nation.</span>

Under Labor's tax plan, anyone earning under $125,000 will get a bigger, better, fairer tax cut compared to stage 1 of the government scheme, so why won't the Prime Minister support Labor's plan to give 10 million Australians a tax cut of $928 a year, almost double the tax cut they'll get from his government?</span>

Aspiration is at the very heart of everything we are doing, seeking to support Australians to realise their dreams. In the very DNA of our parties, the Liberal and National parties, we believe the government's job is to enable you to do your best, to realise your dreams, to aspire and to get ahead. You'd think that was pretty straightforward. You'd think that every Australian would embrace that, but not the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

The honourable member knows all about aspiration. He knows all about hard work. He knows all about getting in, having a go, realising your dreams and being prepared to back yourself. He knows that that is what makes the Australian economy work—the enterprise, the belief and the courage of Australians, overwhelmingly small and family businesses with under $50 million turnover, the ones that are getting the benefit of our tax cuts, which Labor wants to repeal. That's where most Australians work; that's where the jobs are being created.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to enable every Australian to have the highest hopes and the greatest ambitions and to make their aspirations a reality by giving them incentives to get ahead. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said today that aspiration was a mystery to her. It used to be what the Labor Party was about, but that was in the days when the Labor Party members had actually worked, when you had truck drivers, boilermakers and brickies, when you had real workers. Manual labour in those days was not the Mexican band that it is to Labor today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of that stronger economy that we are enabling, that we are seeing, and because of the record jobs growth we are seeing, we have the resources to pay for the essential services Australians need. That's why we can increase funding on public hospitals in the electorate of Longman, in the northern part of Brisbane, by 53 per cent over the time that Labor was in. It's why we're able to offer a five-year hospital funding agreement to the states, which will involve $30 billion more spent on public hospitals. That is why our comprehensive income tax reform rewards enterprise and initiative. It is reform that will see 94 per cent of Australians pay no more than 32½c in any extra dollar they earn from $41,000 up to $200,000—a marginal rate of 32½c. It's a massive reform. It rewards effort. It encourages enterprise. It provides the support for the aspiration that is at the very heart of our beliefs, but is now a mystery to Labor.</span>

Treasury has confirmed that the entire third stage of the government's personal income tax scheme goes to the top 20 per cent of income earners, at a cost of $42 billion. How is it fair that under this arrogant and out-of-touch Prime Minister a property developer in Arncliffe earning $1 million will get a tax cut of over $7,000 a year, while a worker in a charcoal chicken shop in the same suburb will only get a tax cut— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact of the matter is this: under the current tax regime, in 2015-16, for example, the taxpayers earning over $180,000 paid 30 per cent of the total personal tax take to the government, and they represented four per cent of taxpayers. Under our plan, in 2024-25, there will be six per cent of taxpayers earning over $200,000, and they will pay—wait for it—36 per cent of the total tax receipts from personal income tax. Our plan rewards aspiration, encourages investment, encourages employment and is thoroughly progressive. As is the case now, but more so, those on the highest incomes will pay most of the tax.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:13</span>):  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and for her tireless advocacy for low- and middle-income earners in her electorate, because she understands. She is from an electorate that understands aspiration, and she has been championing aspiration all her life and in this place on top of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget we announced a comprehensive and responsible plan for personal tax reform. A plan is when you're actually dealing with problems in the tax system. Yes, our personal tax plan goes first to provide relief to low- and middle-income earners, but in steps 2 and 3 of that plan, it begins the work of dealing with problems in our tax system, such as the problem of bracket creep. If you don't deal with bracket creep, as people's incomes creep up, they get taxed more and more and more, and that puts a stymie on aspiration and on their incentive to get ahead. Stage 2 of the plan sees the second threshold go from $37,000 to $41,000—that's hardly a millionaire—and stage 3 go from $90,000 to $120,000—also hardly a millionaire, as I'm sure the residents of Robertson would understand. So it's a plan that deals with problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party doesn't have a tax plan at all. They don't have a plan. They have no plan. I'll tell you what they've got a plan for, and that's to oppose $70 billion of tax relief for hardworking Australians; as Australians' incomes creep up, Labor will tax them more. What they've announced today is a creep tax. A creep tax is taxing people's income as it creeps up. As incomes creep up, they will tax people more. Labor's plan for low- to middle-income earners is to ensure they stay low- to middle-income earners by not supporting the plans for a stronger economy that we champion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But as the Prime Minister has already referred to today, we understand why. The member for Sydney has regrettably had to leave the chamber, but she was asked this earlier today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… [it's] part of a broader plan and it's about ensuring aspiration within the economy as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister reminded us, what did the member for Sydney say? 'W, w, I—honestly this aspiration term, it mystifies me.' That is what she said. I know a lot of things mystify the member for Sydney: government living within its means, economics, finance; even geography is a great challenge to the member for Sydney, who thought Africa was a country! Well, aspiration isn't in a country; aspiration isn't a continent even. But I can tell you what: it can drive a nation forward, and that's why we believe in aspiration. And the Labor Party have turned their backs on aspiration as they turn their backs on Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It encourages Australians to get on and have a go. It gets rid of bracket creep across that huge spectrum of incomes between $41,000 and $200,000 as 94 per cent of Australians won't have to pay more than 32.5c in any extra dollar.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give three additional reasons why Labor's plan lets down hardworking Australians on middle incomes. A police sergeant in Queensland—could be working in Longman, perhaps—would pay, under Labor's alternative, $1,253 more tax. A school principal in Tasmania—might be in Braddon—would pay an extra $3½ thousand more tax. A police inspector in South Australia—might be working in Mayo—would pay $4,050 more tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party talks about millionaires and billionaires, paying little attention to the reality that everything they are doing is patronising and seeking to hold back hardworking Australians who want to get ahead. Only the most arrogant and out-of-touch Deputy Leader of the Opposition would say aspiration was a mystery. How out of touch do you have to be to be mystified by aspiration? How smug about your big government salaries do you have to be to say you're mystified by aspiration? I tell you what: we understand aspiration drives the nation forward. It is the powerhouse; it is the ambition that we seek to support and enable, and Labor seeks to hold back.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:19</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, a whistleblower tells me that from 1 July Centrelink will stop backdating payments to the intention-to-claim date. This is unacceptable, because people needing Centrelink can initially be in crisis and unable to lodge the paperwork immediately—for example, women fleeing domestic violence—and, when they do, the process can be convoluted, with delays commonplace. This change would also appear to be illegal, because section 13 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 clearly intends that a person is taken to have made a claim when they first contact Centrelink. Prime Minister, will you stop this unfair, unlawful and sneaky attack on the most vulnerable members of our community?</span>

                  </a>  The government is committed to ensuring more Australians find jobs, maximising their ability to support themselves and their families. However, for those who are unable to find work, we have a strong social welfare safety net, and the only reason we can continue to guarantee that into the future is because we've got a strong economy. The honourable member from Tasmania understands well how much stronger the Tasmanian economy has become because of the great Liberal leadership of Will Hodgman, supported by our coalition government in Canberra. </span>

The honourable member would recall that it was a policy change that was part of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill, which was debated and passed by the parliament in March this year. The honourable member didn't speak in the debate, but he did vote against it. The change was made in schedule 11 of the bill, so it is both lawful and very transparent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">is that the deeming provisions were introduced at a time when claim forms were mailed to claimants, completed and then returned to Centrelink by mail. With the progressive rollout of online claiming, these provisions are no longer necessary.</span>

                  </a>  That is precisely why this government has put in place a tax system that is designed to help all Australians, whether they be business owners, employees, the young, the old and everyone in between. Under our personal income tax changes, under our tax plan, 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 32½c in the dollar. Those opposite, unbelievably, would not only stand in the way of that tax cut; they would hit Australians with more than $200 billion worth of new or increased taxes. It's enough for many Australians to think: what is the point? What is the point of expanding their business? The Labor Party will tax it. What is the point of doing an extra day of work, of going for that promotion or doing some overtime? Labor will tax it. </span>

We know they are encouraged by the stronger economy to get ahead, and we will constantly remind them that the greatest threat to that stronger economy is the modern Labor Party, with its denial of aspiration—the denials of self-advancement that workers for generations used to deliver through the efforts of Labor representatives. This Labor Party is a disgrace to all the Labor history and Labor leaders of the past.</span>

Well, there is one actually—with quite a lot of aspiration. The member for Grayndler knows all about aspiration. I don't like to contradict the minister for revenue, who said not one member of the Labor Party knows anything about aspiration, but our friend over here, 'old china', has quite a lot of aspiration. A few people have been saying that the member for Sydney might pip him at the post. Well, after this morning, I reckon he has already got her under the chariot wheels. He has only got one more to go—our friend over here, the Leader of the Opposition. If I were you, Anthony, I would be getting my suit dry-cleaned, because you might get there faster than you think. You are sitting there looking like a sphinx, but your aspiration is well known to us all. Mr Speaker, that's the introduction to my answer! My answer—</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, because of the government's excellent economic management of the budget and the economy, we have been able to make sure we can invest in our defence industry and our national security in this country. Because of the management of the budget and economic management, we can invest in 12 submarines, nine Future Frigates, 12 offshore patrol vessels and 21 Pacific patrol boats for our Pacific neighbours. Labor was never able to invest in any. We are able to invest in Poseidons and Tridents for our reconnaissance and surveillance. We are able to improve and upgrade every single Army, Navy and Air Force base in Australia and build combat reconnaissance vehicles here in this country, driving $200 billion of investment in our military capability that Labor could never have afforded.</span>

I would have lost all my resources as a university student. This privileged elite want to deny people $70 billion worth of tax cuts. We want to deliver $140 billion of tax cuts. They say it is $70 billion or zero. It is like offering people crispy roast pork with apple sauce and then just serving them the apple sauce. That's what Labor wants to do—half a hamburger, not all of it.</span>

I refer to the Prime Minister's earlier answer when he said that his government rewards aspiration. Should a 60-year-old aged-care worker from Burnie aspire to be an investment banker from Rose Bay so that, instead of their $10-a-week tax cut from the Prime Minister, they can get the Prime Minister's $7,000-a-year tax cut for investment bankers?</span>

He's a great local member. He is one of many on this side that supports the government's strong border protection policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When John Howard left government in 2007, there were four people in immigration detention, including no children. Yet, when Labor were elected, promising to the Australian public during the course of the election campaign that they would make no changes to the coalition policy on immigration and border protection, they allowed 50,000 people in on 800 boats and 1,200 people drowned at sea. We're hearing exactly the same rhetoric from this Leader of the Opposition that we heard from Mr Rudd and from Ms Gillard. And, as sure as night follows day, if the Labor Party is re-elected at the next election, the boats will restart—there is no question. There are certain limbs of our policy which cannot be changed, and, if they are, the boats will restart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see some interesting words from the Labor candidate for Longman. Ms Lamb was quoted as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At this point it's not Labor's policy to resettle people in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't put people on Manus and Nauru. The Labor Party put thousands of people on Manus and Nauru. We lifted another six people off Manus yesterday, so that brings, in total, the number of people we've taken from Manus and Nauru, who Labor put there, to 292. We've taken them to the United States. We are cleaning up Labor's mess, but it takes time. You would've thought that people like Ms Lamb and others would recognise that the people smugglers listen to every word that we utter in this place and they market on social media when there is a potential change or a softening or a weakening of border protection policy. Those people smugglers are up in Indonesia now rubbing their hands together at the prospect of this Leader of the Opposition being elected Prime Minister of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor brings people from Manus and Nauru and basically raises the white flag, they are sending a message of defeat and encouragement and, dare I say, aspiration to the people smugglers in Indonesia. The Labor Party has learnt nothing at all from the Rudd and Gillard years, and this Leader of the Opposition, who is weaker than Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard combined, is unable to stand up to people like Ms Lamb. If you're in Wamuran or in Caboolture or at the Burpengary Tavern having a beer tonight, have a look at what's happening in Europe at the moment, where hundreds of thousands of people are trying to make their way across the Mediterranean. If you think that can't happen in this country again, look no further than the failure of Labor's past record and what they would guarantee if they're elected at the next election. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's something on which the Prime Minister has often spoken, and he has, indeed, supported attempts to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. That's what the question goes to.</span>

For the assistance of the House, I'm going to remind the House of my previous rulings on parts of questions being out of order and I'm going to say quite candidly that, in my view, it was deliberately out of order. I'm going to say that very candidly and I'm going to rule very harshly on those in the future, as I have in the past. I'm giving the member for Isaacs, as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, the benefit of the doubt on this one occasion today.

Put simply, the approach of the Turnbull coalition government after the last election was to introduce the Registered Organisations Commission, the independent regulator for registered organisations, be they unions or employer organisations. The alternative is those opposite, who want to abolish the Registered Organisations Commission.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite, the Leader of the Opposition and his team, want to abolish the very organisation that was investigating individuals like Derek Bellan, the former secretary for the New South Wales branch of the National Union of Workers, who was sentenced to four years jail yesterday for intentionally defrauding union members of more than $650,000. As Magistrate Elizabeth Ellis told the court:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The workers that came under the NUW included factory workers, storemen—that is those at the lower end of the wage spectrum where membership came out of what I can only consider to be scant, spare funds …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what was Derek up to? He was up to a bit of the following: botox injections, home tanning kits, P&amp;O cruises. So the botox and the tanning kits now make some sense; you can't turn up with wrinkles and no tan. He had brass knuckle stubby holders—yes, you need those on the cruise, to hold your beer—a tattoo of his parents on his calf—jeez, that's a bit ordinary—and lawyers for his divorce. He was using members' funds for his divorce, so obviously the cruise didn't go that well. And he was using members' money on websites like cupid.com and match.com—so, obviously Derek's bounced.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would the Leader of the Opposition vow to get rid of a body that investigates individuals like this and prosecutes them where they see fit? Why, because, as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> revealed in August 2015, the National Union of Workers helped fund a slush fund to help Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, become the Leader of the Opposition against the people's choice, the member for Grayndler. These are the kinds of union members that the Leader of the Opposition has done his secret deals with. Whether it's the CFMEU—we still don't know what's in that—or whether it's John Setka as he kicks and assaults police, these are the people that the Leader of the Opposition is beholden to. Even those on his own front bench who don't know what's in these secret deals have claws. They are, to their credit, not naming themselves but they are talking to journalists. The Leader of the Opposition will put his union mates ahead of all Australians, whether or not they are union members, on every occasion. We must ensure that he remains the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

That's what a strong economy does. I thank the member for Capricornia for her passionate advocacy and for her aspirational people—the 98,000 or so constituents, all of them aspirational, in Yeppoon, Rockhampton and all those areas in the seat of Capricornia that she represents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She's a strong voice for the people of Central Queensland. She wants to make sure that, every waking moment, she is there trying to build community capacity, making sure that the livability of her communities is enhanced, and she's delivering in spades: $24 million of beef roads and more than $110 million under the Northern Australia Roads Program for the Bowen Developmental Road, Capricorn Highway and Peak Downs Highway. She's investing in her community with $5 million for the Rockhampton Airport Pavement Upgrade project under the Building Better Regions Fund. There's also $12.4 million under the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages—what a great initiative that is!—with a number of projects, including a crocodile-farming and agritourism value-added production system, an on-farm beef-processing facility, an accommodation village, the Fraser Park Redevelopment Project and a new fruit-processing facility for Central Queensland. All these projects build community capacity, as does the $176.1 million Rookwood Weir project. I know how much that's going to help to droughtproof Rockhampton. I know how much capital investment but also commitment has been put into that by the member for Capricornia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects, delivered by her, show exactly how the LNP Team Queensland is delivering for the sunshine state. It's something that the people of Longman also understand. The Liberal and Nationals government here in Canberra is investing $15.4 billion through the Infrastructure Investment Program in Queensland, including an additional $3.3 billion for the Bruce Highway, bringing the total from the Australian government up to $10 billion. There's a billion dollars for the M1 Pacific Motorway. That's going to help Longman. There's $390 million for the Beerburrum to Nambour Rail Upgrade Project, and I know how much the members for Fairfax and Fisher are relying on and investing in that particular project. That's going to help the people of Longman. There's $300 million for Brisbane Metro, $170 million for the Cunningham Highway—I haven't received any letters of thanks from the member for Blair, but I know it's going to mean a difference for his people—and $160 million for the Outback Way. The Liberal and Nationals' Infrastructure Investment Program, a $75 billion development program, is helping the people of Queensland and the people of Australia.</span>

Of course, we've seen net debt peaking; we're turning the corner on the debt that he and his colleagues in the Labor Party created. I notice the honourable member referred to a reduction in tax as spending. You can't spend money that's not your own, you know? Members of the Labor Party think that every dollar that every person earns and every business earns belongs to the government and that, if you reduce tax, it's spending; it's their money. That's the difference. And you know what? They have an aspiration to keep more of it.</span>

That, I am pleased to say, is now a reality. It's a reality because we can afford to do it and it's a reality because of his advocacy.

Federal Labor left us a huge mess when it comes to energy. They left us a huge mess! When Labor was last in office, energy prices doubled. The networks were gold plated. The gas market was ignored, and the warnings were ignored as to the impact of such large exports from the east coast. And what did the Leader of the Opposition do when he was a senior minister in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years? He sat idly by and did nothing—too busy plotting and scheming around the lazy Susan to do anything about energy prices. And what about the member for Port Adelaide? When Jay Weatherill conducted his big experiment in South Australia, the member for Port Adelaide wasn't sitting idly by; he was egging him on, saying, 'Let's take this project national,' even though South Australians paid the highest prices in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we have an energy plan that is working. We have reined in the power of the networks and, if the Labor Party had done it, it would have saved $6½ billion. We've ensured more gas is available for Australians before it's exported overseas. We're getting a better deal from the retailers for thousands of Australian customers, and of course the National Energy Guarantee will leave Australians $300 a year better off than they were under the Labor Party, and it's being supported by the big energy users: BlueScope, BHP, Rio Tinto and the national farmers. And, when it comes to energy prices, lower energy prices under the coalition are not just an aspiration, they're a reality, because in Queensland we have seen prices starting to come down. We've seen the big three reduce prices across New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland—like on the Tarome farm, a family-owned vegetable business in the electorate of Wright, which Glenn and Sally run, employing more than 60 pickers and packers, drivers and mechanics. Whether it's carrots or beetroot, whether it's onions or pumpkins, they are delivering it to the market and, with lower power prices, they can employ more people. This is what the coalition is delivering.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the next election, there will be a clear choice. Under the Labor Party, with their reckless renewable energy targets, with their track record of delivering blackouts and higher prices, you will get more of it. Under the coalition, we are reducing power prices and we will deliver a more reliable and affordable system for all Australian families and businesses.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:02</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports out of this morning's coalition party room and ask: will the Prime Minister acknowledge that Australians are paying the highest energy prices on record because of a lack of policy certainty caused by this government being obsessed by infighting? How can Australians have confidence in a government that fights with itself over energy policy everywhere: in the party room, in the parliament, through the media and even in charcoal chicken shops?</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. He knows what it's like when you combine Labor-Greens ideology and idiocy, which is precisely what happened in South Australia. It got to the point where the wind resource in South Australia could generate more than 100 per cent of the state's demand one minute and then zero per cent the next, and there was no planning to store it or back it up at all, and the honourable member knows that, as do all South Australians. The reality is this: our policies are working. Labor failed in allowing the export of gas from the East Coast without looking after the Australian domestic industry and demand. We have ensured there is sufficient gas available and we've seen wholesale gas prices come down over the last 18 months by around 50 per cent, and the honourable member is very well aware of that. We've seen wholesale generation costs come down by about 30 per cent over the last year. We're starting to see reductions in retail prices across the East Coast—the markets of the National Electricity Market—and there is a lot more to do with the National Energy Guarantee. We are already seeing and delivering lower energy prices. There's more work to do. Labor should support the National Energy Guarantee. It will deliver affordable and reliable power and, at the same time, enable us to meet our Paris commitments.</span>

A very strong advocate was needed in Barker, because in September 2013, when the coalition came to power, the number of premises connected to the NBN's fixed network wasn't 60,000. It wasn't 6,000. It wasn't 600. It was six! There were six premises connected to the fixed NBN network when the coalition came to power in 2013. Today, of course, the number is 51,000 ready for service, 28,177 connected—99 per cent of the rollout completed in Barker. You could look at another important South Australian electorate, the electorate of Mayo. In September 2013, there were 813 premises connected to the NBN fixed network. Today there are 42,710. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN is being rolled out across the country. Forty-three per cent of premises are now taking 50 megabits per second or higher. And what is the economic impact of the rollout of the NBN? If, for example, you happen to be somebody who is aspirational, somebody who wants to build a business, an interesting report by the Regional Australia Institute says that in the biggest town in Barker, Mount Gambier, it's expected that over the next three years there will be between 240 and 700 additional businesses and 1,200 to 2,370 additional jobs as a result of the NBN being available in Mount Gambier in Barker. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are a well-paid Labor MP married to a well-paid bureaucrat, aspiration might be very puzzling to you. As you sip your decaf soy latte, as you munch your kale and quinoa salad, you might wonder: what is this aspiration thing? But I can tell you that in Barker, in Mount Gambier, there could be up to 700 additional businesses and up to 2,370 additional jobs because of the NBN being connected and jobs and economic opportunity are being delivered because the NBN is being rolled out across the country. That is what the coalition government are doing. We are delivering for the people of Australia with the NBN rollout and in so many other ways.</span>

TAFE teachers, students and apprentices from all around the country are gathered in the gallery today for National TAFE Day. Can the Prime Minister please explain to TAFE supporters in the gallery today why he is cutting another $270 million from skills and apprenticeships in this year's budget while still giving $80 billion to big business? Will the Prime Minister reverse his opposition to Labor's plans to cover up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places and train more Australians for well-paid, secure jobs? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

And when it comes to the Labor Party's record on apprenticeships, they saw the biggest single drop in trainee numbers on record: a 22 per cent fall in their last year of office. And do you know who was responsible as the minister when 110,000 apprentices lost their positions? The Leader of the Opposition! He was the then employment minister.</span>

                  </a>  It's a set up, the Prime Minister said! In the years between 2011 and 2013, the Labor Party cut incentives for apprenticeships not once, not twice, not three times, but nine times—$1.2 billion. And who can remember the VET FEE-HELP disaster, where you had funding for courses like veterinary Chinese herbal medicine, graduate community advocacy and a diploma in lifestyle consultation? They were the courses of the Labor Party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Turnbull government is delivering a $1.5 billion Skilling Australians Fund and supporting 300,000 aspirational apprenticeships, while a $70 billion infrastructure rollout is looking to support apprentices all the way and the VET system is now getting going. At the end of the day, you can look at the Labor Party record, where they cut all the apprenticeships and they cut money out of the program, or, in contrast, you can see we're creating hundreds of thousands of new positions for aspirational apprentices across the country.</span>

And today will mean a lot to those survivors. Come 1 July, we will be able to provide them with redress, and our task now—and I say this very much in a bipartisan fashion—is to make sure we deliver that redress to the best of our ability. It will involve a payment of up to $150,000, access to psychological counselling services and personal apologies from the institutions.</span>

You will remember she cut your tie in half, she cut Dan Andrews' tie in half and then she cut Mark Speakman's and Martin Pakula's ties in half. She then headed to cut my tie in half. I said to Leonie I didn't want to do that because I wanted to see the passage of the bill through before I cut the tie in half that I wore that day. I will be going back to my office, I will be cutting that tie in half and I will be sending it to Leonie.</span>

Maybe he should wait until he sees Leonie and let her cut his tie. I'm sure she'll take great pleasure in doing so. I do want to associate the opposition with the words of the minister and thank him for his commitment and his hard work, frankly, to get to today. As he said, it is an extraordinary achievement, first and foremost, for the survivors of child sexual abuse, for the care leavers from institutions. Of course, as all of us know, no amount of money will enable these people who were abused as children to get their childhoods back, but this will be a way in which all of us, all Australians, can acknowledge and pay some compensation for the horrific abuse that people have suffered. Today is a very significant day. It will be a very, very difficult task for this redress to be delivered. A lot of people will have to remember again the abuse that they suffered. But it is something that people have worked very hard for, and I thank the government for their efforts.</span>

                </a>  In question time today, the Prime Minister partially misquoted me, saying: 'Honestly, this aspiration term—it mystifies me.' What I actually said was: 'Honestly, this aspiration term—it mystifies me. As if someone on $40,000 a year isn't going to want to earn $100,000 a year because they are going to pay a bit more tax. They are going to get a lot more income; they are going to pay a bit more tax. I think it's just an excuse and a cover for a government that is determined to give the biggest tax cuts to people like them—people that they want to look after, the big end of town. How is it fair that a surgeon on five times the income of a nurse gets 16 times the tax cut?'</span>

                  <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  After that bizarre question time performance from the government, you wouldn't know that we are in the middle of a very important debate in Australia about two competing tax plans. Today the battlelines have been drawn. The Labor Party have made very clear what we will do and say about the government's tax plans. But what have we had in response from the government in relation to tax? We just had that bizarre performance in which we were lectured about aspiration. We were told that an aged-care worker in Burnie shouldn't be satisfied with helping Australians who are in an aged-care facility and, after having worked hard all their life and at maybe the final stages of their life, they should aspire to a better job as an investment banker. That's what the Prime Minister said during question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were lectured that members of the Labor Party should not aspire to go to university—because, how dare we aspire to go to university! It's a bad aspiration, apparently, to be the first in your family to go to university—and, if your parents or grandparents didn't go to university, you should know your place. That was part of the government's great defence of their tax plan, and we were told other things about aspiration. We are happy to have a debate in this House about aspiration—more than happy. There are lots of Australians who aspire for their children to go to a good, well-funded school, which may be a public school or a Catholic school. There are lots of Australians who aspire to know that their local hospital will be well funded if they need it, at any time of the day or night. There are lots of Australians who aspire to work on a weekend and get decently paid for it. There are lots of Australians who aspire to work and then retire sometime before they're 70. There are lots of Australians who aspire to those things. On this side of the House, we support that aspiration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell you what: we also support the aspiration of low- and middle-income earners to receive a bit more support. This government must think that low- and middle-income earners are fools. This government thinks that a $10-a-week tax cut will make them forget that they've lost $77 in penalty rates, or make them forget that their wages aren't growing, or make them forget that their kids' school is receiving less money, or make them forget that their school leaver's TAFE is underfunded, or make them forget that this government has tried time and time again to rip away the social safety net in this country. I tell you what: the Australian people are not the fools that this government takes them for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more cynically than all of that, this government thinks that they can say to low- and middle-income earners: 'We are finally going to provide you with some modest tax relief, but there are strings attached. We are not going to give you that tax relief on 1 July 2018 unless we can bully our way to ensure that the tax cuts also go to high-income earners in seven years time.' The Australian people, the government thinks, will buy that. I tell you what: I don't think the Australian people will buy that. As I said, the battlelines are drawn. The choice is clear. There is a better way than this government is proposing, and there is a real alternative on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes, governments do unfair things, particularly Liberal and National Party governments, and sometimes Liberal and National Party governments do fiscally reckless things. This government has a habit of doing both all at the same time, which is a special talent. I do give tribute to those opposite; it is a special talent. This government's tax plan is unfair, unaffordable and irresponsible. No responsible opposition would support it, and we won't be supporting it. We won't be supporting their unfunded tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax plan is expensive. Not only is it expensive; it's unfair as well. Take the government's tax plan; it will cost $25 billion a year when it's fully implemented, if it's ever fully implemented. Fifteen billion dollars of that each year goes to Australia's top 20 per cent of income earners. That's the fact. The most regressive part of their plan is stage 3 of the plan. Stage 3 of the plan will grow when it is implemented at a rate of—wait for it—12 per cent a year. The member for Rankin and I have good relations with all our colleagues but if a colleague came to us and said, 'We've got a scheme which is really expensive, which will benefit high-income earners and will grow at a rate of 12 per cent a year,' we would tell them to think again—but not this government. They say, 'Approved! Great idea! Let's run it through the parliament and let's make it a condition. We won't support low and middle-income earners unless we get that through.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government thinks it's a good idea that everybody earning $200,000 should pay the same marginal tax rate as somebody earning $40,000 a year. This is a government which—when you take stage 3 of their tax cuts together with their big business tax cuts—wants to drain the public purse by $25 billion a year. And they lecture us about budgets! They have the hide to lecture us about responsibility. Well, we'll have a debate about responsibility and we're happy to have an election about responsibility as well as fairness. We are more than happy to do that, because under our tax plans every Australian earning less than $125,000 a year is better off. They would be better off now and better off next year in the first years of a Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if they got stage 2 of their tax plans through, every Australian earning less than $95,000 a year would be better off under the Labor Party's plan—70 per cent of working Australians better off—a fairer plan which is more responsible and better targeted when it comes to the budget. We'll provide tax cuts almost double what the government is providing, we'll provide them to 10 million Australians and we won't make them conditional on some never-never plan to benefit high-income earners either. We'll actually say to the Australian people, 'We'll provide tax relief that is fair, affordable and responsible, and we're more than happy to take it to an election.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it very clear: we will take no part in this government's reckless, irresponsible and unfair plans, and we'll be voting accordingly in this House. If the government wants to try to hold the tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners hostage, as they've indicated they will do, then there are two possibilities. They can split the bill—they can surrender and split the bill—and we'll pass that legislation today through the parliament. We'll pass it tonight; we will even sit late and we'll pass it, if the government wants. Or, alternatively, if they won't pass it—if they won't relent and split the bills—then an incoming Labor government will provide that tax relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the way the government has designed the tax rebate, it could be passed at any time in this financial year. It doesn't need to be passed by 1 July this year. It can be passed by 1 July 2019. That would give an incoming Labor government time to implement it, and we will if they won't. We will actually go to the people with a tax plan which is funded and which is affordable. We'll deliver it—unlike this government—and we won't put those conditions on it. The fact of the matter is that the lines are drawn and the choice is clear. And if the government really believe their rhetoric, if they really believe the case they're putting to the Australian people and if they really have the courage of their convictions then there is something they can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister had another line of attack during question time. He said, 'Okay, you don't like stages 2 and 3 of our tax plans, but why don't you vote for them anyway?' I can understand why he'd say that. He would understand a lack of conviction. He would understand a Prime Minister who wouldn't vote for his beliefs! I understand a Prime Minister who said he wouldn't lead a party that wasn't as committed to action on climate change as he is—now look who sits behind him as he is Prime Minister of Australia! So I understand that that's his approach, but we have a different approach on our side of the parliament. It's a novel approach for members opposite: we vote for what we believe in and we vote against what we don't believe in. And that's what we'll continue to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll vote for better tax cuts, for fairer tax cuts and for real relief for low- and middle-income earners, and we'll vote against schemes which are unfunded and unfair. We'll vote against them in amendments and we'll vote against them in the substantive legislation as well. We'll vote against them continually in this House, and I tell you what, we will also take that position to the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Prime Minister really believes his rhetoric, there is one thing he can do with the courage of his convictions. There is a building down the road, it's not far away. It's called Yarralumla, and he can get in a car, he can drive down there and he can say to the Governor-General: 'I can't get my tax plans through the parliament. It's all very terrible. The Labor Party are insisting on bigger tax cuts for lower- and middle-income earners but they won't let me get my scheme through. Governor-General, I'd like an election, based on our tax plans.' 'That's what he can do! He can get in his car, he can drive down there and he can call an election based on our competing plans. And do you know what we'll say? 'Bring it on!' That's what we will say, Mr Deputy Speaker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are ready. We relish it. We relish this argument. The Treasurer could have turned up to take this debate. He's in his office doing other things. He could turn up to take this debate to defend his tax plans, but he won't do it. I tell you what, he won't be able to hide if there is an election campaign on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  The hide of the shadow Treasurer! The hide of this man today, to come to this dispatch box and talk about working- and middle-class Australians on a day when he stood up and said to 10 million Australians, 'We want a bit more of your money and we are going to deny you a tax cut.' That's what this shadow Treasurer got up and said today, and now he is desperately trying to scramble and desperately trying to justify it. But, once again, we see a shadow Treasurer who just wants to reach his hands a bit deeper into the pockets of hardworking Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see it time and time again. We saw the bluster of the shadow Treasurer at the dispatch box—the bluster, the faux-hairy-chested shadow Treasurer, running around the country talking about his faux class welfare. The only people that the shadow Treasurer wants to go after are those who work hard or those who are vulnerable. He is running around the country talking about going after billionaires and millionaires. Who are the groups that he has gone after? Who are the two groups that contribute the most to the $220 billion of additional taxes as proposed by this shadow Treasurer?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it's not all of the millionaires and the billionaires; it's not the Apples and Googles of the world. The two groups that this shadow Treasurer's going after, the two that contribute the most to his cash grab, are retirees, with his retirees tax; and small-business owners, who own small retail shops, who own cafes and who might employ one or two people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, for hardworking Australians, for those who are on low and middle incomes, this government has delivered in spades and will continue to do so. Last year, we had 415,000 new jobs created. The shadow Treasurer said five years ago that there was absolutely no way the coalition commitment of one million jobs within the first five years could be met. Well, no: we met it in 4½ years.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SUKKAR:</span>
                  </a>  The shadow Treasurer believed us. Well, that's wonderful. If the shadow Treasurer believed in that commitment, he should walk out of this chamber, do a press conference and say, 'I always believed that the coalition government could deliver it,' but we know that he didn't. We know he said it was impossible, and last year 415,000 jobs were created. Every single one of those people—and let's remember, nearly 80 per cent of those jobs were full time—are better off because of the decisions made by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we've got the shadow Treasurer saying to 10 million of them—4.4 million of them who will receive the full tax benefit of $530 and the remainder getting up to $530—that they don't deserve a tax cut. How on earth can the shadow Treasurer justify to those people that they don't deserve it, in addition to every other policy of this shadow Treasurer that seeks to hurt those individuals. This shadow Treasurer's capitulated on energy policy. He's capitulated to the 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target as outlined by the shadow environment minister, which is just going to see energy prices rise further and further and further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This shadow Treasurer, sadly, has form. We knew the shadow Treasurer when he was in the Gillard-Rudd governments, as the worst immigration minister that this country's ever seen—even worse than the Manager of Opposition Business, which is a pretty high bar. But then he went on to become shadow Treasurer, and we all remember the very infamous coined term of the 'Bowen $16 billion black hole'. Now we've seen a black hole again. This week we saw a very, very big black hole from the shadow Treasurer. We remember a couple of months ago when the shadow Treasurer said: 'We have a very calibrated, well-thought-through policy on our retirees tax. It's very calibrated and it's very well thought through'. Then the shadow Treasurer, within a fortnight, backflipped. This well-thought-through, well-calibrated policy was changed on the run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, again, we see that the shadow Treasurer's been caught out with a huge black hole in his costings. But we're used to that from him. We're used to that from when he was the Treasurer—$16 billion. Now we see it again, with $1.1 billion over the forward estimates. It isn't a surprise from this shadow Treasurer, because we see it time and time again. We say to the shadow Treasurer: come clean on your approach to small businesses. We know the shadow Treasurer refers to the owner of a small cafe that employs one or two people or a hairdresser that employs a couple of staff as a millionaire or billionaire who doesn't deserve a tax cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer is going to go to the next election and say: 'We're denying 10 million Australians a tax cut. We're going to reach our hands into the pockets of retirees, people who are on low incomes, and reduce their income by up to 25 per cent by denying them refunds on franking credits. We're going to increase taxes on small and medium businesses.'</span>

How much does the shadow Treasurer believe that the top 20 per cent of taxpayers should actually pay? The top 23 per cent of taxpayers pay 65 per cent of all tax. How much more should they be paying? The shadow Treasurer never says that, because that would require him to go out and say to people who are getting up at 6 am every day, working hard, missing out on family obligations, saving and trying to do things for their family: 'You're not contributing enough and you don't deserve a tax cut.' How much do you want those 23 per cent of people to pay? Or, if we talk about the next 53 per cent, who pay another third of the income tax, that 70 per cent of Australians carry our tax system, and the shadow Treasurer got up today and said: 'You do not deserve a tax cut. In fact, you're not paying your fair share, and we're going to go after you a bit more.'</span>

It's boiled down to him attacking working Australians on low and medium incomes, going after retirees, people who are on low incomes, and denying them up to a quarter of their income—</span>

He's saying to them, 'No, you don't deserve a tax cut either.' This shadow Treasurer is so divorced from what ordinary working Australians need that he thinks they don't deserve tax cuts—in fact, they should contribute a bit more because, apparently, carrying the whole system is not enough for those 70 per cent of taxpayers. And, in addition, to top it all off, they should be paying higher electricity costs in order to fund mad green schemes, because Labor has capitulated to the Left. On this side of the House, we will always fight for those people who want to strive hard, who have aspiration and who want to do better for their families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  In the member for Deakin's contribution just now, he managed to do two things which, until then, I had thought would be impossible. First of all, he made the member for Bradfield sound like Martin Luther King and, secondly, he made that Liberal Party punch-up at charcoal chicken seem enlightened in comparison to his contribution. In his defence, the Prime Minister is no better. We had a question time where the Prime Minister did some extraordinary things which I suspect he might be seeing in some campaign videos between now and the next election. But he also did something else: he quoted one of the Labor greats; he quoted Paul Keating in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of people on this side of the House know and admire Paul Keating. The member for Lilley does; the member for McMahon knows him well. Paul Keating has been right about a lot of things in his political life, but he's been especially right about the Prime Minister. He was the one who described the Prime Minister as a fizzer, and he got that spot-on. The other thing he got right, which we don't talk about enough in this place, is that the current Prime Minister went grovelling to Paul Keating, with Richo in tow, and begged him for a Senate seat, saying, 'Please give me a Senate seat.' So devoid of principles was the current Prime Minister that he was prepared to show up here in any party. Paul Keating was right to say, 'No, off you trot!' He was especially right to predict that Malcolm Turnbull would bob up somewhere in the party with the lowest standards. That's what we've seen.</span>

                  </a>  The other thing Paul Keating was right about is something we're very proud of: the Labor Party is the party of aspiration. The Labor Party is the party of aspiration. Those opposite wouldn't know the first thing about aspiration. They don't have the necessary affinity with working people that we have to understand that aspiration is fundamentally about working hard, studying hard, getting ahead, providing for your family, looking after your community, making a contribution to your community and making a contribution to your country, as the member for Jagajaga said. What our parents wanted for us we want for our kids and for every Australian kid: the opportunity to get ahead in this country. The government don't have the necessary affinity with working people to understand that. They don't understand that the key to this country and the thing that makes this country extraordinary is social mobility. The fact is that someone in a suburb like the one I was born in, like the member for Lalor's electorate and like all of our electorates can work hard and get ahead in this country. They just don't get it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we were treated to today from the Prime Minister was the sickening spectacle of a Prime Minister who, from that despatch box, thinking he was being clever—he had the angry teapot out and he was doing all of those sorts of moves—boasted that, 'I've seen a lot of wealthy people in my time.' How sickening is the sort of stuff that he goes on about! The thing that really stuck in our craw was when we asked him about a 60-year-old aged-care worker, and the Prime Minister of Australia said to a 60-year-old aged-care worker, 'If you don't like the tax cut you're getting, go and get a better job.' A disgraceful slur! A disgraceful slur on the aged-care workers of this country! They just do not understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a party that likes to talk about how much they hate the redistribution of wealth, those opposite sure are doing a lot of it. The key fact about the tax cuts that they want to impose on this country is that 60 per cent of the benefit goes to the wealthiest 20 per cent in this country. That's redistribution. By anyone's definition, that is redistribution. That's what they are into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will continue down this dangerous and perilous path of rising inequality and less social mobility for as long as these characters are on that side of the parliament. That's why the member for McMahon was so right to say that there are two ways to resolve this big barney we're having about tax right now in this parliament. One is to split the bill so that we can vote for genuine tax relief for 10 million working Australians. But we can also have an election and take it to the people. Let the people of Australia resolve this. Let the people of Australia choose between our bigger, fairer tax cuts and the trickle-down Reaganomics proposed by members opposite. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  The member for Rankin says the Labor Party is the party of aspiration, one of the most ridiculous things that has ever been said in this chamber. Just today, the Labor Party said, 'Let's increase taxes on Australians by $70 billion.' That's just today. The government says $140 billion of tax relief to Australians across the spectrum; the Labor Party says no. They want to cut that by $70 billion. That is the exact opposite of supporting aspiration. They wouldn't understand aspiration if it came up and hit them in the face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also say that a business that has $2 million of revenue is some sort of big multinational that mustn't be provided with any tax relief, so they voted against that. A business with $2 million of revenue is a small, striving, suburban, regional business—precisely the sort of business that should be supported. These are precisely the sorts of businesses that create millions of jobs in this country. Yet they say, because they voted against it, that that business should not have any tax relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, the rest of the Senate was sensible and supported tax relief for those businesses and, as a key consequence of that, we have rampant and record job creation in this nation—the greatest job creation in Australian history under this government, with some 415,000 jobs created in 2017. That was no thanks to those opposite, who seek to crush and sit on aspiration at every opportunity that they get. They want to put a $20 billion new tax on the housing market, going after the most important asset of the vast majority of Australian households. They want to put a $20 billion new tax on housing and, perhaps most shamefully of all, they also want to go and pick the pockets of Australian retirees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened over there was that as they sought to finance their extravagant spending—because they can't control government spending; we've seen that before when they're in office—they said, 'Where can we get some money?' They said, 'We know where we can go; we can go to Australian retirees that have saved for their retirement and smash them with a multibillion-dollar tax increase.' That would come in immediately, basically, if those opposite came into government, affecting some 900,000 Australians—an absolute disgrace. They say that it is a bad thing to get to a position where 94 per cent of Australians pay a marginal tax rate of no more than 32½ per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We say that's a fantastic thing, because it will encourage aspiration. It will mean that people earning anywhere between $41,000 and $200,000 a year will pay no more than 32½ per cent of their income to the government. That is good, because that means those people are going to keep more of their own money. It's their money, it's not the government's money; it's the employee's money. Those opposite want to take more of it and it is an absolutely inappropriate policy. We believe that people should keep more of their own money.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this policy, the people who earn over $200,000, who are in the top bracket, will pay an even higher proportion of tax than they do today. So it is a policy which is still progressive, but it is a policy which says to the average Australian worker who's out there aspiring: 'Go for it! Work harder! Work hard for that promotion. Work hard to take on those extra responsibilities and you will not go up into a higher and tougher tax bracket'. That's exactly the sort of thing that governments should be doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in this passionately. Those opposite do not believe in it because they believe that all money resides with the government. They believe it's the government's and they believe that it's some sort of act of largesse if the government lets you keep some of your money. We believe the absolute opposite: money earned by employees is their money and we should take the bare minimum of that to finance the operations of the government. And we should encourage aspiration, we should promote aspiration and we should celebrate those people who go out, work hard and build the economy of this nation. We should not smash them with hundreds of billions in taxes, as those opposite would do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  Aspiration, aspiration, aspiration! I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker, sitting here in question time and listening to the Minister for Defence Industry, who has been a member of parliament for the good part of forever, talk about aspiration just epitomises how out of touch this government is. They say that they believe in aspiration, but we know that they certainly do not believe in the aspirations of working- and middle-class Australians because of their failure to prioritise them—their complete failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from a very proud working-class background. My dad was a bus driver and my mum was a nurse. In fact, my mum worked in aged care. She was a very proud aged-care worker—I believe she looked after Mr John Howard's mother in her day. If the Prime Minister suggested to my mother, as he did today, that she should 'aspire' to a better job than being an aged-care worker, I hazard to guess what my old mother might have had to say to the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a long time since I was a struggling single parent but not that long ago that I was a middle-income earner. I will tell you just how out of touch this Prime Minister is. This Prime Minister is so out of touch that he wants someone on a $200,000 salary, which could hardly be described as middle income, to pay the same rate of tax as someone on $40,000—someone like Renee, from Marangaroo in my electorate. Along with her husband, she is raising her two girls, Aisha and Sarah, on a $40,000 middle income. And not only that; this government's grand plan for working-class and middle-income Australians includes an $80 billion tax cut for corporate Australia, $17 billion of cuts to schools, $270 million cut from TAFEs, unfair cuts to pensions and a requirement for people to work until they are 70. How is that going to work if you are a roof tiler or a carpet layer? There will be a $77-a-week cut to the penalty rates of hardworking Australians. Families and pensioners are paying $20 a week more for private health cover. Parents are paying $40 a week more for child care, and there are record costs to see a GP. Australians are now another $9 out of pocket when they go to see a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been a struggling single mother living from pay cheque to pay cheque, I have seen it all. I have seen how it adds up—$20 here, $9 there, $40 there. It all adds up. And what does this out-of-touch government have to offer? A measly $10 a week. It is insulting that this government thinks it can throw crumbs to hardworking Australians who have lost penalty rates, who haven't seen wage increases for years and who can't access TAFE or higher education for those who aspire to more. It is insulting to parents like me who today are feeling the sting of having to leave half their groceries at the shopping centre counter because they simply can't afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In question time the Prime Minister talked about aspiration, as he often does. I am convinced that he doesn't actually know what aspiration means. Aspiration, according to this out-of-touch Prime Minister, is directly correlated to the size of your pay packet. As a low-income earner who aspired to send her kids to school, to get an education and to lift her family out of poverty, apparently I was not one of Malcolm Turnbull's aspirational Aussies—because I didn't earn enough, because I wasn't a banker and because I didn't have rich parents.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  It must be very disheartening for the Australian people to listen to the sanctimonious and hypocritical blather from those opposite. They come in here and preach about looking after all Australians when at the same time they are planning to rip billions and billions of dollars away from hardworking Australians. The hypocrisy is breathtaking; it is arrant hypocrisy. I think Australia has actually woken up to it. To come into this place and on the one hand say that you are the friend of the Australian people while on the other hand you are ripping away tens of billion dollars from Australia's most vulnerable—Australia's retirees—is shameful in the extreme. Our retirees are people who helped to build our nation. They worked hard, they saved, they took out mortgages and they did the right thing by putting away money for their retirement. Now 800,000, 900,000 or a million of them are going to find that the hand of the Labor Party is going to go into their super accounts and take their retirement funds away. It's disgraceful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just wealthy Australians who will be hit, even though that's how they portray it. You've got to remember that the median income for retirees is just over $31,000. As reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> recently, retiree Toya Adams, a former nurse and flight attendant, is angry about it because she and her husband are going to lose $20,000 every year under the Labor party's proposal. She said that it's 'mischievously misleading' for Labor to attempt to portray this as just for wealthy people. She said, 'I am not a privileged mega-wealthy tax bludger'. No, Toya, you're not. You're one of the hardworking Australians who helped build our nation and build a future for your family. That is now at risk because these people are out to destroy your retirement savings. It' an absolute disgrace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a $9.9 billion black hole in the costings. No-one should be surprised about that, given these are the people who brought you the pink batts fiasco. They can't manage anything. It's a management issue. We're talking about the cash blowouts for school halls, the Rudd money that was literally shovelled out the back of a truck. They squandered the wealth of our nation. That's what they did. Now they're coming after vulnerable retirees—people who've worked hard and helped build our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reckon the best thing that we can do to help Australian people, besides leaving their retirement savings alone, is to give them a job. Wasn't it wonderful to see the unemployment rate dropping to 5.4 per cent? It continues to drop. But it's not just in the cities that we're seeing these drops. If you compare how we're going with the days of Rudd-Gillard-Rudd, we're travelling extremely well. Last year jobs growth was the best on record, and, in May 2018, the level of employment increased to a high of 12,518,300—2.5 per cent above the level recorded a year ago. As I said, if you compare that to the shaky days of Rudd and Gillard, the contrast is stark. I'd like to draw your attention to a few examples in my own electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since June 2013, unemployment in Lithgow has dropped 4.7 per cent from 10.1 per cent under Rudd-Gillard-Rudd to 5.4 per cent. Oberon, in the high country out in the Central West, unemployment went from 5.5 per cent under Rudd-Gillard-Rudd down to 2.5 per cent now. These are real figures. These are impacting on people's lives, because we're giving them jobs. In Bathurst, unemployment was 6.2 per cent in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era. It's down to 3.5 per cent. In the Mid-Western Regional Council area it is down from seven per cent to 4.3 per cent. In the Cabonne council area it is down from 4.1 per cent under Rudd-Gillard-Rudd to 2.3 per cent. In Blayney—you can't forget Blayney—unemployment was 5.1 per cent in 2013 under Rudd-Gillard-Rudd; it's down to 3.2 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Total employment has increased by over one million jobs since September 2013. That's an 8.8 per cent increase since the government came to power. These are real results, and they're making a real difference to the lives of people, not only in the cities but also in country areas. One of the most important things that we can do as a government is make sure that our people in the cities, but most importantly in the regions, actually have jobs. Compare this to those opposite, where the days of high unemployment reigned supreme—and now they're coming after retirees' savings! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is the government's approach when it comes to managing our economy. Listening to question time today, there were the top-five hits that we focussed on inside the Labor Party. I think my favourite was when the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services got up to answer a question and said 'What's the point?' Then we had the message from the Prime Minister—as the member for Rankin, my colleague and friend, when defending aged-care workers, referred to—'If you're an aged-care worker and you're 60 years old, you haven't amounted to much and you should get a better job.' Then there was the hypocrisy from the government in saying that somehow members on this side of the chamber who attended university don't have a right to be in this place, or that somehow members who have achieved something from humble beginnings, if they'd gone to university, have risen above their station. Talk about class warfare. Talk about attacking those—like my family and my father and my mother, who came from very humble beginnings and who were lucky to finish year 7—who didn't go to university. My grandparents didn't go to university. The Prime Minister of this country says, 'You have no right to be in this place.' It's outrageous. What a pack of snobs.</span>

                  </a>  All those opposite sit in complete ignorance about what is happening out in the real world. Let's be clear. Let's get some real facts into this debate. Labor members and the government have an opportunity this week to ensure that working and middle-class Australians will receive income tax relief starting in 12 days time. This could be passed today, as the Leader of the Opposition said, and passed in the Senate. If you are true blue about giving real tax relief, you will join us and make it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter what the hissy fit, no matter what the dummy spit, like we saw from the Prime Minister and all those opposite in question time today, it doesn't hide the fact that the government are standing in their own way to deliver real tax cuts to millions of working and middle-class Australians. Instead, the priority of this Prime Minister and every other member of the Turnbull government is to give tax cuts to big business and high-income earners—at a cost to the budget of $25 billion a year in 10 years time. Over the medium term, this tax cut will cost the Australian economy a whopping $140 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw today that the Prime Minister was quite happy to see an executive earning $200,000 a year pay the same rate of tax as a cleaner earning $32,000 a year. That is the definition of fairness under the LNP. Come and speak to the cleaners in my electorate and come and speak to the food-processing workers who are struggling to make ends meet. In my community, a teacher in Mount Ommaney on $65,000 will receive a tax cut of $928 a year and a couple working in Forest Lake earning $90,000 and $50,000 respectively will receive a tax cut of $1,855 a year under a Bill Shorten Labor government. That is under a real government that will deliver real tax reform for those who need it. Almost 70,000 people in my community would be better off under a Shorten Labor government, with our bigger, better and fairer tax package—because we live in the community; we live in the real world every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's vote on it and let's make it a reality today. But, if you don't want to do that, take it to an election. Take it to an election and, in the seat of Corangamite, Libby Coker will be standing up for real working people—in contrast to the sellout that we are seeing with the current member. In every electorate, whether it be Corangamite, my electorate or the 150 electorates in Australia, we will be reminding the Australian people that, when it comes to real tax reform and genuine tax relief for those who need it, only a Shorten Labor government will deliver it.</span>

The member for Oxley spoke about Libby Coker, who is currently a councillor with Surf Coast Shire. I've never seen a more pathetic and hopeless councillor than Libby Coker. She can't even stand up for the people of Anglesea. She had an idea to create the Messmate Track bypass—an idea which has been comprehensively rejected by the people of Anglesea. She had this 'great' idea to destroy the Anglesea Bike Park, and 5,500 people signed a petition supporting that bike park. She had no plan to find an alternate location; nor did she have any funding. She has now had to crawl back from her position. She has been a weak and pathetic councillor and would make a terrible member for Corangamite. She does not have the guts to stand up for the community she represents in Anglesea, let alone for Corangamite. Today and every single day, I will continue to hold to account those who fail the people of Corangamite, like Alcoa, who botched the demolition of the power station, which has asbestos in it, as far as we know—and she has not said a thing. The member for Oxley has made a pretty big error in raising Libby Coker's track record, because I can tell you that the people of Anglesea think it's absolutely pathetic.</span>

                  </a>  Like most hardworking Australians, many of us work very hard to make sure our kids have a great future. My mother did that, and I am incredibly proud of what she did for our family and the contribution she made to the Geelong community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one thing for certain with this dishevelled and unprincipled opposition—lies and taxes directed at the most vulnerable Australians. There was no bigger lie than Labor's 'Mediscare' campaign, a big fat lie directed at senior Australians to scare them and to make them fear for their future. This was the most disgraceful lie—a deliberate, deceptive, disgraceful campaign. Australians, I'm very pleased to see, will be protected from this deliberately deceptive behaviour because of the legislation that we have now passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now what are we seeing from Labor? We're seeing a plan to deliver more than $200 billion of taxes. Australians don't need campaign videos to know what this mob is all about. The biggest slug is on retirees—$5 billion a year—including some pensioners, and self-funded retirees, many of whom are sitting just above the pension threshold. Nine hundred thousand of the most vulnerable Australians are under attack by Labor. What hypocrites are members opposite! They're quite happy to provide the tax deduction from franked dividends to high-income earners but, if you are a low-income earner and you rely on the cash refund from the ATO to pay bills and to put food on the table, Labor says, 'Tough; don't worry about it!' Labor know they have huge problems with this policy. They know that this policy, more than any other, attacks the most vulnerable of Australians. It's a $57 billion tax slug over 10 years—but, of course, as we know, Labor can't even get their costings right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aspiration is not about having your life savings ripped out from under you, which is what Labor is all about. Consider what we've seen from Labor's plan to attack businesses. Let's not forget that a few years ago Labor supported lower company tax rates. The Leader of the Opposition and others argued that this was good for business and good for jobs and investment. Now, in an unprincipled reversal of that position, we have seen Labor declare a war on business—and they were the Leader of the Opposition's very own words. This pathetic and weak Labor Party is so unprincipled that it can't stand up for Australia's coal workers and it's now planning to drive jobs offshore by this terrible policy, including the $70 billion it is penalising Australians with. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I come from an area in Sydney that is undergoing rapid change. The south-west is experiencing unprecedented growth, and one welcome result of that growth is the increasing number of young families moving into my electorate. These people are optimists. They are often in their first home and starting a family. However, they're also the first to feel the effects of the increased cost of living that we're seeing now. They're the ones who most need tax relief, not the big end of town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locals in my area are struggling because of the Medicare freeze, where fewer doctors are able to sustain bulk-billing. They're struggling because of the massive price increases in electricity after Liberal governments, both federal and state, sold off infrastructure to private interests and because there has been a vacuum where energy policy should be. They are struggling because of childcare costs. They're struggling because of the lack of infrastructure, which sees them spending more time in their cars in traffic jams than with their children and not able to find parks at railway stations after 7 am.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being in government is about choices, and I'm afraid that this government has not chosen the working and middle class in my electorate or Australia-wide. What they are saying to locals in my area is that they are happy with inequality and happy to see them continuing to struggle. Moreover, they seem to think that a person earning $200,000 is struggling just as much as someone who's earning $40,000. Apparently, in the bizarre world of this government, it is actually the families struggling the most in my area that should be doing more for the top 20 per cent of income earners. It simply isn't fair, but those opposite don't seem to understand that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just the latest chapter in the story of this government's continuing attacks on the quality of life of locals in my area. They've chosen to give a tax cut to the big end of town, with $17 billion to the big banks rather than $17 billion to properly fund our schools. They have cut penalty rates, and now workers in retail, food and accommodation are set to lose up to $77 a week. They've stood by while private health insurance premiums have increased by $20 per week and childcare costs are up by $40 a week. The cost of seeing a GP is now at a record high, over $9 out of pocket for each visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These pressures mean that middle-income and lower-income earners have more financial pressures to contend with than ever before. Australian households have one of the biggest debt-to-income ratios in the developed world. They are struggling. These pressures will only continue to grow under this government's unfair plan. In my region it is difficult enough to physically access these essential services. Transport is scarce and driving is an increasingly costly necessity, with the New South Wales Liberal government's plan to extend the toll on the M5 for another 40 years. From what I have seen in the New South Wales budget today, it's going to take them 10 years to build the road that will access the airport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can young people in my area be expected to obtain their full potential if they can't access decent schools and universities? How can their families support them if parents are working and commuting for longer periods just in order to cover the essentials? It's the job of the government to ensure that support is there for everyone to have a decent quality of life no matter where they live. Moreover, we all have a responsibility to ensure that no aspect of a child's background is a decider of their potential. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer do not see this inequality. To them, it would appear that welfare is about the few and not the many, as they support a package that would deliver more inequality. On the other hand, they have the option of supporting bigger, better, fairer income taxes today—tax cuts that actually target those who need them most. Labor's plan would mean that those earning up to $125,000 a year would be better off when compared to the government's plan over the next four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is ready to vote today for tax cuts for 10 million people from 1 July 2018. We're ready to work constructively to provide better tax relief for the Australians who need it most. What we're not prepared to support is the creation of a situation where someone on $40,000 pays the same tax rate as someone on $200,000. This is unfair, and this government should know better. I call on everyone opposite to show some real compassion for working- and middle-class Australians like those in my area, and to work with Labor today to deliver the tax relief they sorely need.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PITT:</span>
                  </a>  And some aspiration on top of that! I note that the member for Rankin has left the chamber, but I would like to congratulate him for his contribution. He actually could describe what an aspiration was. He knew what it was and he could explain it. I thought it was a very good explanation, unlike the member for Sydney's earlier in the day, who went with the INXS song 'Mystify'! I think it's a very difficult proposition to put forward for some.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here to talk about working-class and middle-class Australians. I haven't heard a lot of contributions from the other side that have actually focused on those people we are here to represent. It is about them, and there are many of them in my electorate. In fact, in my electorate, the per capita annual income is just $34,000 a year. That is not a substantial amount of money, but they manage to make do. They manage to put their kids through school; they manage to do all the things that normal families would do. What are we doing for them? That is our job as the government. We are here to encourage them and provide them with opportunities. We're going to provide them with tax relief. In my electorate, almost 49,000 individual taxpayers will benefit from the low- and middle-income tax relief that will occur in 2019 if, of course, we can get it through the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the contribution from the member for McMahon. The Labor Party are making threats about what will and what won't pass the Senate. I notice he didn't mention that in the House of Representatives they supported the bill. It went through the House, it went to the Senate and they've changed their mind. So, in this instance, who do you trust? It's clearly not those opposite. It is clearly not the Labor Party. People in my electorate want tax relief. They want us to continue to build the economy. They want us to continue to provide opportunities for them. Those are the almost 49,000 taxpaying individuals in my electorate. I'll give you some examples. If you're a high school teacher on $75,000 a year in my electorate, you'll have an extra $530 in your pocket in 2019. Five hundred and thirty dollars is a significant contribution in an area where the per capita annual income is just $34,000. If you're a shop assistant on $45,000 in my electorate, you'll have an extra $440 in your pocket from the budget year of 2019 onwards. That is a substantial increase. Whether you're an apprentice, a hairdresser, an accountant or a takeaway food operator, there are opportunities for you. It is your hard-earned cash that we are trying to inject back into your pocket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the alternative? What's been put forward by those opposite is an additional $200 billion in taxes. No matter what they say, they're not Robin Hood: they are not robbing from the rich to give to the poor; they have their hands in your pocket through their retiree tax, their housing tax, their investment tax, their tax return tax, their higher income tax, their family business tax and their savings tax. We can go on. Who can forget the tradies tax. All of these are about taking more money from hardworking people in low- and middle-income areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the contribution from the member for Calare. He spoke about the impact that this would have on self-funded retirees, pensioners and those who have put away a little bit of money. The proposal to take away imputation credits is wrong. If you are earning money through shares in a company, that company has paid tax on your behalf at a particular rate. If that rate is not what you would usually pay when it comes to tax time, like every other Australian in this country who pays tax you can put forward what your actual rate is and it is adjusted. Sometimes you pay a bill, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, as you may have. On other occasions, people may get a return, and I think that's great for them. In my electorate, we are doing everything we possibly can to provide more opportunities for those in the low- and middle-income area, and that includes developing local infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm sure you saw the announcement on the Bruce Highway: the Cooroy to Curra section, section D, the final piece of the puzzle—an $800 million contribution from the federal government to complete that section of the Bruce Highway. Once again, I congratulate the member for Wide Bay on his sterling lobbying work. This will make a substantial difference to all of the people in both of our electorates because our people drive on that highway. We know how dangerous it is. It will make a real difference to the people who are working in, living in, retiring in or travelling to the capital cities for any reason. I certainly look forward to that work commencing. The state government is making a lot of noise up there through the member for Maryborough, who, I must say, is wrong, because we are ready to commence that work when the state government hits the 'go' button.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' <span style="font-style:italic;">Human rights scrutiny report: report 5 of 2018</span> and the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual report 2016-17</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the new bills contained in report 5, 26 have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit or do not engage human rights. The committee is seeking further information in relation to 11 bills and legislative instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to highlight one of these bills, the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. The statement of compatibility accompanying the bill draws extensively upon the committee's previous human rights analysis of the Commonwealth Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2017. This approach was valuable to the committee in undertaking its technical analysis. The department and minister are to be commended for their work. This example also illustrates the constructive role of the committee in helping to ensure that human rights issues are appropriately considered in legislative policy development.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also contains the committee's concluded examination of eight bills and instruments. Following correspondence with the relevant minister, the committee has concluded that three of these bills and instruments are likely to be compatible with international human rights law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual report 2016-17</span>. This report covers the period from August 2016 until the end of 2017 and provides information about the work of the committee, including the major themes and scrutiny issues arising from the legislation examined by the committee. The annual report details the significant work the committee has undertaken during the reporting period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this respect, the committee tabled 17 scrutiny reports examining a total of 405 bills and acts, and 2,942 legislative instruments. Of the bills considered in this period, the majority, 309, were initially assessed as either promoting human rights, permissibly limiting human rights or not engaging with human rights. The committee requested further information in relation to 54 bills in the reporting period, and provided 42 advice-only comments to legislation proponents. The committee also tabled one inquiry report during the period, a <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of speech in Australia report</span> which contained 22 recommendations, including those aimed at improving the complaints-handling process of the Australian Human Rights Commission.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's annual report to better inform their consideration of the committee's work during the relevant period. With these comments, I commend the committee's fifth report of 2018 and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual report 2016-17</span> to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  Labor will be supporting this Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018, and I foreshadow that I will move a second reading amendment later during my comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018 extends for another year a measure first introduced in the 2015 budget which allows small businesses to deduct immediately purchases of assets they start to use, or install ready for use, that cost less than $20,000. The measure applies to businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million. Over the forward estimates, the measure will cost $350 million to the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supported the initial measures, which went from 12 May 2015 to 30 June 2017, and Labor supported the measure when it was extended for another year, to 30 June 2018, in last year's budget. Of course, we should all remember that the accelerated depreciation, or the ability to deduct assets, particularly in the first year of an asset's life, was originally an initiative of Labor. Labor originally recognised the value of an increased immediate deductibility threshold for small business entities. It was Labor that increased that threshold from $1,000 to $6,500 as part of a broader package of reforms contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Stronger, Fairer, Simpler and Other Measures) Bill 2011. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor subsequently opposed the Abbott government's decrease in that threshold from $6,500 to $1,000, which they announced in the 2014-15 budget. We all remember that horror budget. It came in the wake of the election of the Abbott government. The then Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, said there would be 'no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to the ABC or SBS', and then proceeded in the first budget to do exactly that. They undertook massive cuts to health, education and, of course, the ABC. And they're doing that again. We learned what they really think about the ABC on the weekend, when the federal conference of the Liberal Party voted to privatise Australia's national broadcaster. Nonetheless, I digress. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Abbott government did reduce that threshold from $6,500 to $1,000, making it more difficult for small businesses to use the ability to write off those assets, it was Labor that actually opposed it. For that measure, it was Labor that was standing up for small business in the wake of this government attempting to make things more difficult for small businesses in this country by reducing that threshold from $6,500 to $1,000 dollars. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then we saw the government change its tune. Thanks to the good lobbying of the Labor Party, and indeed many in the community, in the 2015 budget they changed their tune. Labor has supported the government's measures since that time. We all know that these types of measures provide tangible benefits to businesses and their investment plans. Many Australian businesses, operators and their advocacy groups, the peak bodies, have actually indicated that these types of measures are more effective and have broader support than the proposed company tax cuts that the government is looking to get through the parliament. That is because these provide tangible and real benefits that are immediate to a small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the great benefits of the company tax cuts flow to foreigners compared to Australians, because of the operation of dividend imputation. The real beneficiaries of the company tax cuts, which the government is proposing will take $80 billion out of the budget—and bear in mind that the government is cutting funding to hospitals, schools, TAFE, the ABC and other organisations—will be overseas investors, because they're not affected by dividend imputation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has proposed a very different option to what the government is proposing in terms of relief for small businesses in particular. We have said we will support the government's tax cuts for small businesses up to a threshold of $2 million. But we won't proceed with the corporate tax cut that the government is proposing, the $80 billion corporate tax cut, which applies to all businesses, including the big mining companies and, indeed, the big four banks, who have done such a wonderful job in representing the interests of their customers and acting in their best interests over the course of the last decade! But Labor has come up with an alternative, which is based on our consultations with the small business community and their requests for relief, and we're calling it the Australian investment guarantee. This will allow all businesses to immediately write off 20 per cent of all new investments in tangible and intangible assets in the first year. The balance is then depreciated in line with normal depreciation schedules for the rest of the period in the life of that particular item. It's a real boost to the cashflow of small businesses, helping improve the prospects of the marginal projects that may otherwise be struggling to get up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our investment guarantee is an accelerator for small business growth in Australia, driving new investment in essential plant, machinery and equipment. It is also a measure to help the development of knowledge assets supportive of new investments in our economy which embody innovation and human capital. From firms expanding the capacity of their factories in outer metropolitan areas to farmers wanting to buy the most sophisticated trucks and machinery in regional areas and advanced manufacturers wanting to upgrade their computerised technology in Australian cities, Labor's policy supports all of those businesses and provides them with instant relief and instant encouragement for investment in small pieces of machinery and capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us also be clear that our support for this measure does not in any way influence Labor's position on the government's company tax cuts. As I said earlier, we remain opposed to the government's proposed corporate tax cuts for the big end of town. Unlike the government's company tax plan, Labor's Australian investment guarantee will provide targeted tax relief for businesses that invest in Australia and in Australians. It's part of our economic plan for our nation, which includes properly funding schools, universities and TAFE; boosting apprenticeships; building a better NBN; and investing in job-creating infrastructure. Our responsible economic plan will grow the economy, create jobs and improve the budget bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to detail for the House some examples of businesses that would benefit from Labor's investment guarantee. A food manufacturer operating in regional Australia may be looking to spend $6 million upgrading to new energy-efficient freezers to ensure it can store its growing stock of food. Labor's Australian investment guarantee would help deliver the investment because it would deliver an immediate cashflow of $1.2 million to the manufacturer. That money could then be used to hire new employees and continue their business development and expansion plan in key markets in the Asia-Pacific region. As part of Labor's measure, the food manufacturer gets both the benefit of the instant cashflow through the write-off and the improved energy efficiencies from the new freezer equipment. More efficient equipment can help to reduce the carbon emission intensity of the production processes and, of course, produce significant savings in energy costs each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's Australian investment guarantee would significantly boost business investment in energy-saving projects, lowering energy bills, cutting carbon pollution and growing jobs. While the Turnbull government tries to talk up their commitment to improving energy productivity, the fact is that Australia's performance has been dismal in recent years in this area. We only need to look at the latest report card on national energy productivity, where it's revealed that energy productivity growth has fallen from a long-term average of 1.7 per cent per year to just 0.4 per cent in the last year. This poor performance puts a break on business and jobs growth. It also amplifies the effect of energy price hikes under the Turnbull government and makes cutting industrial carbon pollution harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The case for backing Labor's Australian investment guarantee is clear. Along with energy efficiency benefits, recent modelling by the University of Victoria shows that, compared to straight-out company tax cuts, an investment concession like Labor's investment guarantee can produce up to three times more effective stimulus to investment. And Labor's plan is permanent. The Australian investment guarantee won't be subject to annual budget cycles like the government's instant asset write-off and like this particular bill here. This is the reason we need to update this once again; it's reviewed every year by the government. Labor's investment guarantee, if we are elected at the next election, will be permanent. Of course, the government's corporate tax cut does not guarantee any new investment on each dollar spent. It's a clear contrast to what Labor is proposing. The corporate tax cut can go directly to paying for share buybacks or dividend increases here and offshore, and not to new investment. Labor's plan guarantees that the government is supporting investment in Australian businesses, and we all know that there's been underwhelming performance when it comes to business investment in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's broad support for the measure that Labor is proposing. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in its prebudget submission called for more incentives exactly like the one that Labor is proposing, specifically arguing:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. James Pearson, the CEO of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor's announcement is a welcome one as it would make it easier for Australian businesses to invest and grow. The fact that this measure is available to all businesses, big and small, is also very positive as it will help small businesses directly as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest in the products sold by small business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's the voice of industry. That's what small business representatives, medium business representatives, bigger business representatives and the peak industry bodies in this country are saying about Labor's proposed Australian investment guarantee. It's clear that the investment guarantee really is about jobs, growth and rewarding businesses that make new investments in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While our plan guarantees that new investments in Australia are made in Australia, the Liberals' $65 billion tax handout will only guarantee windfall profits and windfall advantages for foreign shareholders and bigger executive bonuses. Labor's tax relief is targeted and affordable, and it works. That's why I move the following second reading amendment:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that unlike the Government's company tax cut plan, the Opposition's Australian Investment Guarantee will provide targeted tax relief for businesses that invest in Australia and Australians, and guarantees new investment".</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  Wasn't that speech from the member for Kingsford Smith a typical Labor speech? Of course, there were some wonderful lies in there—typical Labor lies—suggesting that the government is cutting funding for hospitals and schools when they know full well hospital and school funding are at record highs under the Turnbull government. But that won't hold them back. They shall lie, because Labor tells lies very well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something else Labor does well is raise taxes. Despite the member for Kingsford Smith's long speech about their—as they call it—alternative economic plan, the Australian public know full well that the Labor Party has a plan for an additional $200 billion of new taxes. I want to say to every mum and dad out there: vote Labor and you will be poorer. Vote Labor and you will have less money in your pocket. They know that if they are owners of homes they will have to pay more, and they know that they will be able to save less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for retirees, they are absolutely in the sights of the Labor Party. They have a model—as we worked out this week—and they have totally botched it; it's a $10 billion black hole. But the Labor Party are absolutely going hard after retirees, because they love taxing. They love to tax. This is why I'm so happy today, because I sensed in the member for Kingsford Smith's speech that they actually support at least instant asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation. That's good news. It's a hallelujah moment. The Labor Party has had a come-to-Jesus on this one. They have realised that we actually can reduce the impact on business, and we can help businesses out. We need to capitalise on that and move forward. It's once in a lifetime that we see the Labor Party actually wanting to help small and medium businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am happy to rise today to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018. I do so with my electorate of Fairfax sitting smack-bang in the middle of one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia. I constantly hear two things from small businesses in my electorate. No. 1 is that they want to keep creating jobs for Australians. No. 2 is that they want to see government continue to support small business. Indeed, this is what the Turnbull government is doing. We know we are delivering for small businesses, because we have seen more than 1,000 jobs being created every single day. That's over one million jobs created since the coalition was elected in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is supporting Australian businesses to capitalise on an economy that is now in its 27th year of consecutive growth. We are supporting Australian businesses to grow and to capitalise on growth beyond our own borders, with global growth now at its fastest in six years. There's a reason the Australian economy's GDP growth is looking so strong, why the last quarter of national accounts showed a one per cent increase in our GDP, why we're now looking at a 12-month improvement of 3.1 per cent. It is because this Turnbull government wants to empower and is empowering small and medium businesses, and all businesses alike. It is fundamental in our DNA to empower people to achieve their best. That is precisely what we are doing with our tax regime. That is why we are supporting tax cuts for businesses. It is why we have already delivered tax cuts for small business and it is why we are also cutting bureaucracy to make their lives easier. In fact, the latest regulatory reform report shows the bureaucratic burden on business was cut by more than $800 million a year between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this bill before us today is a popular one. I believe that, despite the comments from the member for Kingsford Smith, it has widespread support among people in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also has extensive support from business and industry. That's because it's good policy. We know good policy when it works, and this policy has been proven to work. Extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off to 30 June 2019 supports small businesses to invest in their own core assets. This extension is for all small business entities, even those who have previously opted out of the accelerated depreciation rules. As for assets over $20,000, these can continue to be pooled and depreciated at a 15 per cent rate in the first year and 30 per cent each subsequent year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our accelerated depreciation measure, coupled with the Turnbull government's 2017 initiative to change the threshold that defines a small business from a turnover of $2 million up to a turnover of $10 million, is having a broad and positive impact on the small business sector right across the Australian economy. In my region of the Sunshine Coast, in Queensland, more than 5½ thousand small businesses have already taken advantage of the instant asset write-off. That is, 5½ thousand businesses have already used this measure, and what they're seeing as a result is more money put in their pockets. What they are typically doing with that money is investing in their business and employing more locals on the Sunshine Coast. It is giving them confidence to invest and grow. It is giving them the confidence they need to create more jobs. As early as March this year, more than it 12,700 new jobs had already been secured by Sunshine Coast residents. This number would have no doubt doubled by now, as we're heading towards the end of June.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are real, tangible outcomes resulting from a highly practical set of measures adopted by this government to help small businesses grow and be successful. As sure as night follows day, it also leads to the employment of more Australians. I know this because I used to own and run my own small business. While I'm no longer in business myself, I speak regularly with business owners right across the Sunshine Coast, and they're singing praises for this measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been fortunate enough to have visits to my electorate of Fairfax recently from the Hon. Craig Laundy, Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation, and Senator Zed Seselja, the Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation, and last year from the Hon. Michael McCormack in his then capacity as the Minister for Small Business. These visits allowed me to introduce the ministers to many small-business owners and visit their workplaces, like the printing business in Maroochydore that employs 10 locals. The instant asset write-off tax concession helped them purchase a new finishing machine for their printing press. Also, the self-employed photographer who purchased a much-needed drone to expand his business into aerial photography. These are just two simple examples of the Sunshine Coast's 40,000 small businesses investing into their businesses because of measures such as the instant asset write-off.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those around the chamber may not know that the business environment is quite unique on the Sunshine Coast. In fact, according to the Chief Economist of Australia, the Sunshine Coast is one of Australia's only non-urban regions fostering innovative entrepreneurship, comprising a unique clustering of R&amp;D expenditure, IP generation and entrepreneurship attributes. That may have something to do with our burgeoning medicinal cannabis industry, or maybe even our 13 craft breweries. I'll admit I felt a warm glow at budget time, when the Turnbull government took the popular decision to lower the keg tax for craft breweries while increasing the alcohol excise refund cap to $100,000. Even though some have joked about the keg tax, these measures are producing tangible outcomes—delivering for small businesses, increasing their production, helping them invest in quality improvements, and, more than anything, helping them hire more staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that small businesses are vulnerable to sudden adverse business conditions. They can put a strain particularly on a company's cash flow, and the smaller a business is, the more that strain on cash flow hurts. That is precisely why incentive measures such as the instant asset write-off are so important. Further, and quite deliberately, it is the temporary nature of the measure through to 30 June 2019 that the government hopes will encourage small businesses to bring their capital investments forward to help feed business confidence and drive economic activity at the local level. Continuing the support for immediate deductibility for businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10 million by allowing an instant deduction in the year the cost was incurred for depreciating assets of less than $20,000, while also offering the potential to leverage a small business asset pool for other depreciating assets that cost $20,000 or more, is excellent news. It's excellent news for the more than 3.3 million small-business owners across the country and the 40,000 small businesses on the Sunshine Coast. It's for those reasons that I'm more than happy to commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I'm actually really pleased to be getting up to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018. Labor will support this bill, although we have moved a second reading amendment. The bill will extend for another year a measure, first introduced in the 2015 budget, that allows small businesses to immediately deduct purchases of assets that cost less than $20,000 that they start to use or install ready for use. Over the forward estimates, the measure will cost $350 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having listened to the previous speaker claim that the Labor opposition had had some sort of epiphany in supporting this, I'd just like to correct the record a little. It's a good reminder that it was Labor in government that originally recognised the value of an increased immediate deductibility threshold for small business entities, and we increased the threshold from $1,000 to $6,500 as part of a broad package of tax reforms contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Stronger, Fairer, Simpler and Other Measures) Bill 2011. That change was permanent. It was a permanent change in the tax law that allowed businesses to plan ahead on the assumption that, in any year, if they bought a piece of equipment, they would be able to have an instant write-off of $6½ thousand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We opposed the Abbott government's decrease in the threshold—the effective abolishing of that change—from $6,500 back to $1,000 announced in the 2014 budget. We introduced the instant tax write-off; the Abbott government abolished it again in 2014-15. But then, a year later in 2015, the Abbott government decided to re-introduce it on a temporary basis until 2017, and we supported that. It was increased to $20,000 at that stage, but it was a temporary measure for two years. We supported it again when the government decided to extend it for another year to 2018 in last year's budget, and we support it again now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we don't have the same admiration for the temporary nature of these kinds of tax laws. It's incredibly important for businesses of all kinds to be able to plan ahead. When you introduce a tax law which expires in a year then you affect the way that businesses spend their money; you affect their investment decisions. They pull things around. You can see that in the forwards. You see the cost of these measures during the years of operation, and then you see a dramatic increase in the tax take the year after because businesses have pulled their spending forward in order to make the most of a temporary change in tax law. We on this side of the House prefer to introduce tax laws that are affordable and on a more permanent basis. That allows businesses to plan under their normal business cycles rather than a cycle matching a short-term tax benefit—which this government clearly prefers, because this is the third time they've done it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The instant asset write-off is a measure that benefits small business, and that is why, as the shadow Treasurer has said, Labor will support this bill. Labor has supported and recognised the value of increasing the deductibility threshold for small business entities, because we know it is the strength and diversity of our small and medium enterprises that will determine Australia's prosperity over the next decade. We want to get right for small businesses how we best position ourselves to take advantage of the massive wave of change that will revolutionise how our businesses operate and the world in which we live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know small businesses will be significant drivers of future economic growth. Small businesses are often the first to recognise new technologies, apply the energy, passion and entrepreneurial skill required to grow their business and find new ways to work in an ever more connected world. Strong local small businesses support community cohesion through the family businesses and local businesses that contribute to the fabric of our community, that satisfy local need, that create relationships and support other local businesses and that contribute to our sense of place and identity. We know that these types of measures help small business with their strategic development and their investment plans, but we don't flip-flop on our support. We believe these measures should be on a permanent basis. We opposed the Abbott government's decrease in the threshold for that reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also put forward our own policy, the Australian investment guarantee, which is a permanent tax write-off. It's a little different to the way the government has structured theirs. Theirs is on equipment up to $20,000. Ours allows business to immediately write off 20 per cent of all their new investments in tangible and intangible assets in the first year, with the balance depreciated in line with normal depreciation schedules from the first year. So there are two options on the table here: the government's temporary instant tax write-off on equipment up to $20,000; and Labor's Australian investment guarantee, which I believe is a superior plan and is a permanent one that allows businesses to immediately write off 20 per cent of all of their new investments in tangible and intangible assets in the first year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth looking at the problem that our approach solves. The economy is not delivering for middle-class and working Australians. Growth is below trend, wages are flatlining, more than 700,000 people are unemployed and nearly 1.1 million are looking for work. Business investment has declined by 20 per cent over the past five years, and the RBA has said non-mining business investment has been disappointingly low. This is despite a strengthening global economy. The government's only plan is a company tax handout to big business and multinationals, which doesn't guarantee any new investment or a single new job; it only guarantees a windfall to multinationals and costs the budget $65 billion over a decade. Labor believes that the Australian investment guarantee is a better way forward. Policies to grow human capital through substantial investments in education and skills, our physical capital through targeted investments in national and local infrastructure and an Australian investment guarantee that charges business investment into the future is the way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe the Australian investment guarantee will boost investment and create new jobs, with the Australian investment guarantee providing targeted tax relief for businesses that invest in Australia and Australians. Under Labor's Australian investment guarantee, all businesses in Australia will be able to immediately deduct 20 per cent of any new eligible asset worth more than $20,000, with the balance depreciated in line with normal depreciation schedules from the first year. Assets such as tangible machinery, plant and equipment—for example, trucks and utes, but not buildings—and intangible investments such as patents and copyrights would be eligible for the immediate deduction. The Australian investment guarantee is a pro-growth, pro-jobs reform that rewards businesses for making new investments in Australia. Under Labor's Australian investment guarantee, only companies that make the decision to invest in Australia will benefit from this tax relief, while up to 60 per cent of the conservatives' company tax handouts, in contrast, go directly to foreign shareholders. So there are the two options: an Australian investment guarantee, which goes to companies that decide to invest in Australia, or the government's big business tax cut, 60 per cent of which goes directly to foreign shareholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past five years, business investment in Australia has collapsed by 20 per cent. Despite strengthening global economic conditions, business investment in Australia has remained subdued, and we must act to change that. Our first plan was permanent, our instant tax write-off scheme back during the global financial crisis was permanent and so is the Australian investment guarantee. It's permanent into the future and that allows businesses to make big investment decisions and to plan ahead what they intend to do for the growth of their businesses, without considering the tax cycle as a factor in deciding how and when they invest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to run through what this actually looks like. Under normal depreciation rules for a piece of machinery, assuming the straight-line depreciation method, which is standard, manufacturing company A is allowed to deduct 10 per cent, or $1 million of the $10 million price, in each year over the effective 10-year life of the asset. So they spend $10 million on the equipment, their machinery, and they can deduct one million—that's the current situation—with the other $9 million, in equal proportions over the remaining nine years. But these arrangements aren't actually quite attractive enough to get the project off the ground. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's Australian investment guarantee, the manufacturing company will be able to immediately expense 20 per cent, or $2 million, of its investment in the first year. The remaining 80 per cent of $8 million would then be depreciated over the effective life of the asset from the first year, in line with the original depreciation schedule. This means that the business would be able to write off $2.8 million in the first year of its investment instead of $1 million under existing arrangements. Again, because this plan once introduced is ongoing, business would not need to consider pulling that investment forward in order to get it into a year, as you would have to do with the government's plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it quite extraordinary that a government that talks about certainty and talks about supporting business comes back into this House three times in a row and extends this instant tax write-off for another year as if that has no effect. We all know in this place—any of us that pay attention to tax, and some of us do because tax is quite a fascinating subject—that best practice is that tax law shouldn't inadvertently affect the decisions that business makes. You shouldn't choose this investment or that investment because of the tax treatment. You shouldn't choose to spend now rather than later because of the tax treatment. In a perfect world, your tax system doesn't inadvertently change the behaviour of a business or an individual. Sometimes you do it on purpose—for example, you tax tobacco. You introduce taxes that incentivise or de-incentivise a particular behaviour. But you do that on purpose. You don't do it by mistake. I would say to this government that removing the permanent tax write-off and introducing a temporary one and then extending it for a year and then extending it another year and doing it so late in the year—I mean, we're doing it now for the next financial year—leaves businesses right up into this moment assuming that they need to spend their money now, because if they spend it next year the tax write-off will no longer exist. It really is quite extraordinary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, your own figures show that you know that's the case, because the year after the tax write-off finishes your tax take suddenly increases. You know full well that what this does is pull the spending of businesses forward into another year, not because it's in the best interests of the business, but because you've introduced a short-term tax incentive that has that effect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge all businesses out there to have a very real look at our Australian investment guarantee. It gets an incredibly good response from the broader community. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in it's prebudget submission called for more incentives for businesses to invest, specifically arguing the government should adopt the opposition's proposed enhancement to accelerated depreciation. James Pearson, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Business welcomes this commitment from the Opposition – it's good policy. What's particularly positive is the proposal to make this a permanent feature. This is important as policy certainty and policy consistency is critical for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Investment Guarantee would provide a significant boost for businesses to invest particularly for longer-lived investments.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  On this side of the House we all know that small business is the absolute engine room of the economy. There are 2,101,607 small businesses in Australia, with over 218,152 in my home state of Western Australia. In WA, 512,000 people are employed by those small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is absolutely backing small business, and we always will. We're backing business with more competitive taxes to help them invest, grow and employ more workers. As the Prime Minister has said repeatedly, jobs and growth is not just a slogan; it's actually an outcome, and more than a million Australians are now in work since this government was first elected back in 2013. It's an absolute credit, though, to the hundreds of thousands of businesses around the country who have actually taken the risk themselves. They've invested their own money, they've done the hard work, they've often mortgaged their house and, as I've said, they often don't sleep at night either. They put in a massive effort and have given so many other Australians the best of all opportunities, which is, of course, a job. Often, small businesses give Australians their first job, and their last job as well. I've seen this repeatedly in the south-west in my electorate, the transformation of someone who's been able to come off welfare and get into work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is backing industry and small business particularly to invest and create jobs. It is the central plank of our stronger economy that was set out in this year's budget, and the Turnbull government is delivering on that commitment. Employment is now at a record high of over 12.5 million Australians now in work. The government has already legislated tax cuts for 3.3 million small and medium Australian businesses, employing 6.8 million workers. This is a very key part of our 10-year enterprise tax plan. We've increased the unincorporated small business tax discount rate from five per cent to eight per cent, up to a cap of $1,000. This rate will increase to 16 per cent by 2026-27.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key and important way we've supported small business is by lifting the small business entity turnover threshold from $2 million to $10 million. This measure has helped small businesses all over Australia. Another one of the measures that we've introduced that I hear so much about when I'm out in my electorate is the $20,000 instant asset write-off that we see in this bill here; this has been extended by this bill to 30 June 2019. I talk to so many owners for whom this has been such a great benefit to their businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday night, I was fortunate enough to attend the South West Small Business Awards. They're the small business awards for the South West region in my electorate. They were held in Bunbury. I want to congratulate all of the winners and to speak about some of the small businesses that are actually benefitting from the decisions we've made on tax and also this decision to extend the instant asset write-off. When I look at the winners, I see Nudge Psychological Assessment and Consulting, based in Busselton and Bunbury. It's a private practice providing psychological services in areas around educational assessment, EAP services, victims of crime counselling, workers compensation and the NDIS. It employs a number of specialist clinical psychologists. It was awarded the best business with five to 10 employees, and co-owner Melissa Harrison, an absolute powerhouse in Nudge Psychological Assessment and Consulting, was named the Business Person of the Year. What a great result, Melissa; you've done a fantastic job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The major winner of the award for a business with zero to four employees was The Barberia of Bunbury. It is a vintage style barbershop based in Bunbury. Adam and Saylor do a fantastic job in styling and cutting hair for everyone around the region, not just those in Bunbury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the award category of businesses with 11 to 20 employees, Constructive PD was the winner. They are a group of passionate local people who are absolutely making their mark in what are landmark construction projects. Innovative and cutting edge, they have dedicated employees who are led very, very competently by Ian Meachem. They're working so hard to provide quality building services in Western Australia. Ian was the runner-up in the Business Person of the Year award.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major awards in the South West Small Business Awards was SportsPower of Bunbury and Eaton Fair. In 1978 a group of individuals had the foresight to see an opportunity and had the courage to actually have a go. Eight independent sporting goods retailers got together and formed a co-op called Sports Star. Their idea was very simple: operating as a group offered greater advantages than trying to survive as individual retailers. This strategy was so successful that Sports Star became SportsPower in 1985. The group has continued to increase its advertising and marketing presence and has embarked on an expansion program that has seen SportsPower create a significant network that is very highly regarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to talk about the Home Based Business Award winner, The Goodnight Nurse. It's a fantastic home-based business. The Goodnight Nurse provides expert help for babies and new mothers to get through solving sleep issues. When you talk to new mums, the thing that challenges them the most with a young baby is dealing with issues around sleep. Emma Pollard is an absolute character, and she has an international following. She's providing in-house and phone consultations, as well as running her very much sought after public workshops. She established this business in 2008. She is an absolute character; a multi-multiaward winner. From her home-based business, Emma does amazing work helping not only young babies but also toddlers with sleep and behaviour issues. What an amazing business this is. I'm very, very proud of Emma and the work that she does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Start-Up Business Award winner was Eco Warehouse. They are a small, family-owned business. Michael and his wife and two young boys run Eco Warehouse from Bunbury. It's an amazing and diverse business. It has been built around a zero waste lifestyle. If you're becoming aware of the issues and the challenges facing us, Eco Warehouse is the place to get help and advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the tourism section of the small business awards was Holberry House of Nannup. Louise Stokes offers people a wonderful getaway. It was built in the late 1980s, but it was inspired by the classic two-storey English manor. It's very comfortable, it's country style and it's enhanced by antiques and collectables. But mostly it's Louise there. She is an amazing local entity in Nannup.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the retail sector, I need to mention Stepping Out. Established in 1996, it's a local supplier of dancewear. These are small-business people who take the opportunity and who are really good at what they do. Nicole and her team at Stepping Out are a wonderful example of that. Nicole invested her own money, she believed so strongly in this. She has filled a fabulous niche as a leading supplier of dancewear and accessories to dancers and dance schools throughout Australia. She is based in Bunbury. They have a massive range to choose from, and they are absolutely committed to delivering high-quality service. That's what small- to medium-sized businesses do: they deliver high-quality service. I know that Sienna Deane from Stepping Out was one of the finalists in the Employee of the Year Award.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Industry Award for Service, 3D HR Legal, which provides special employment law services for business, were the winners. The Industry Award for Construction, Mining and Manufacturing winner was the Caravan Doctor, based out of Busselton. People can just drop off their caravans for a service, without worrying—it's a drive-through yard. So they know their market, and that's what small business does so well too. Like the Caravan Doctor, they know their market and provide what their customers need, and people keep coming back. That's what's so good about small businesses. Keip Filtration won the Aboriginal Business of the Year and the Young Business Achiever Award. Daniel Macmillan from H&amp;H Automotive was the Employee of the Year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really wanted to mention all those small businesses, not just because they won awards but because these are the people who actually had the courage to invest in a business that they believed in. Often it was a brand new business and a brand new idea, and they did it so well. The process that Business South West runs in enabling the businesses as part of the application process for this Business of the Year—going through their individual businesses—actually gives them the capacity to look at their business as well as work in their business. On the night I heard so often that that process was so valuable to each one of those small businesses, because they actually stepped back and had to look at their business almost in a hands-off approach. Those businesses that come back have all really benefited, year after year. They have actually learnt so much about their business and what else they need to do to progress and grow their business and their profits. The process has been very useful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that has also worked very, very well for them is the support they've received from Business South West. I want to thank Business South West for everything they've done for the small businesses in the whole of the south-west. Robyn Morris, as the chair of the board, and Fiona Fitzgerald and her fabulous team have offered extraordinarily valuable services. I've recommended them so often to small businesses in my part of the world, and they have been very, very much part of the success of many small businesses. They don't just provide the support; they provide the care for the employees, the family members and the businesses more generally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure in this bill of defining small businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million is one of the biggest issues. It's one of the biggest things to happen to small business taxation in generations. It comes from our deep commitment, acknowledgement and understanding as a government about what small-to-medium enterprise actually is. A small business has a turnover of up to $10 million: I have quite a number of these in my electorate, and they certainly appreciate the opportunity from what's in this bill. Allowing businesses to grow by extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off for a further 12 months will have impacts for businesses of up to $10 million. They can repeatedly buy eligible assets costing less than $20,000 that were first used or install-ready for another year to 30 June 2019. This really matters to small business. It can be something as simple as an oven if you're in the hospitality sector. In my electorate I have many of these types of businesses, as well as those in the small manufacturing and construction space. Each $20,000 matters and each new piece of equipment gives them the opportunity to grow their business and employ more people in my part of the world. I want to see more and more small to medium enterprises now—because they can as a result of this legislation—take advantage of this $20,000 instant asset write-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by saying a huge thank you to each of those small businesses. They are helping the government in its ambition to see over a million more people in work. That frequently comes back to the work and the efforts of people in small to medium businesses. I say thank you to each of them. Thank you for the fact that you actually had the courage to invest, to follow your passions, but to take a genuine commercial focus on your business—as we heard at the small business awards on Saturday night in Bunbury. Nudge Psychological Services said on the night that, at the end of their first full operating month, they made the princely profit of $1.40—I think that was the amount; I'm not 100 per cent sure, but it was some small amount—and grew their business from there. They persisted. That's what small businesses do, and that's why this government will continue to support their efforts.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  It sounds like the member for Forrest has some terrific local businesses in her part of the world, and I enjoyed hearing some of their stories in her contribution just now. I'm also pleased that the member for Parramatta is here in the chamber. The member for Parramatta is an extraordinarily dedicated champion of small businesses not just in Parramatta but right around Australia. She has a small business background and is a very valuable and respected contributor to small business policy on our side of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chambers of commerce—they've got different names all around Australia—are so important. They do a really good job of representing the interests of small to medium sized businesses in our community. I want to begin my contribution by acknowledging the work of the Logan Chamber of Commerce. I've been a member of the Logan Chamber of Commerce for some years now. It is a great group, and a very well motivated contributor to our local community. I want to acknowledge in the House of Representatives just how much I appreciate the engagement that we have with the Logan Chamber of Commerce. Just two weeks ago I gave a breakfast briefing to the Logan Chamber of Commerce at Diggers RSL. I was joined by my friend and colleague Cameron Dick, a terrific minister in the state government. He is now the Minister for State Development and Infrastructure. What I told the Logan Chamber of Commerce then—and it is the crux of what I want to tell the parliament today—was that when you've got pretty serious budget constraints you want to make sure the tax relief you give to businesses is targeted to where it can do the most good. We want to make sure that we get the maximum bang for our buck when it comes to tax relief for Australian businesses. And that's why we wholeheartedly support the bill before the House, which is about the instant asset write-off. We wholeheartedly support it for a range of reasons. An important reason why we support it is that we were the authors of it. I worked on this policy in another role in this building. I worked for the member for Lilley, who was the first Treasurer to implement this instant asset write-off. Unfortunately, it was chopped by the member for Warringah and the member for North Sydney in their first budget and, frankly, I'm pleased to see it back and pleased to see it extended. We support that because it is an important way to deliver targeted tax relief which will make a real difference to businesses in our local areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to target tax relief to where it can do the most good, where we can get the maximum bang for buck. For the same reason, we have proposed an Australian investment guarantee, which is all about accelerated depreciation for businesses of all sizes to ensure that the money we're investing in that tax cut or the money foregone from that tax cut in the budget is guaranteeing investment onshore in Australia. That means investment in Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues that we have with the government's alternative—the $80 billion tax cut—is that, as Goldman Sachs, the Prime Minister's former employer, and others have pointed out, a large chunk of that $80 billion in tax cuts will actually spray around overseas in the form of executive bonuses, share buybacks and puffed up dividends. So we don't think that an $80 billion outlay on a tax cut like that will actually do the good we need it to do onshore. That's why we've proposed an alternative. That's how we roll on this side of the House. If we don't like something the government has put up, whether it be to do with personal income taxes, company taxes or other policy areas, we propose an alternative. Our alternative is the Australian investment guarantee. I think, together—</span>

                    </a>  What an absurd interruption that is! I'm talking about company tax. If you don't understand that this bill is about company tax, you should go back to your office and have a read of it. That's just pathetic behaviour, and you should be above it. Stop wasting the time of this parliament with such childish and petty interventions. Anyway, back to the substance of the bill, which the government should be proud of. It's their bill; given I'm giving a speech about supporting the legislation, you'd think you wouldn't want to interrupt that, but I don't think we should judge you by normal standards, by the sounds of that intervention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, back to the issue. We think that businesses deserve tax relief in this country, and it needs to be targeted. It shouldn't be the $80 billion gift to multinationals, of which $17 billion will go to the big banks. It should be stuff like what is in this bill. It should be the instant asset write-off for small businesses. It should be the Australian investment guarantee that we've proposed. That's how we get maximum bang for the buck when it comes to tax relief for businesses in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't propose to deal with the bill in any detail in terms of its specific contents. As other speakers have said, the main aspect of the bill is that it will extend the government's accelerated depreciation measure for small businesses for a further 12 months, to 30 June 2019. The measure applies for businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million. It means they can immediately deduct those smallish capital purchases. As the member for Forrest rightly said, it might be an investment in a fridge or something like that if you're a cafe. You can imagine all the capital needs of genuinely small businesses. A lot of stuff that they need to conduct their business is under $20,000, and this allows them to write it off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, we support it. We are the authors of this policy and we're pleased to see it extended. We were terribly disappointed when there were cuts made to this initiative in the 2014 budget. We made the point at the time that the government should reverse course on that, and we are pleased that they did. Whether it was a humiliating backdown or not is a matter for the political argy-bargy of this building. It probably was a humiliating backdown—there have been a few of those—but we're pleased to see the outcome will be what we called for at the time. If only the government would see the light when it comes to their $80 billion tax giveaway to multinationals and big banks as well. If they were able to swallow their pride on that, like they swallowed their pride on this measure, then the budget would be better off and we'd get more bang for the buck for our tax relief for Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, when you lay out the alternative tax proposals of that side and this side, really the main difference is the targeting towards smaller businesses and targeting towards investment onshore in Australia. It makes very little sense to give so many billions of dollars to foreign multinationals and the big banks at a time when we've got record and growing debt in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also makes no sense to give a tax cut of that magnitude or that nature to multinationals and the banks when, at the same time, while the government can find $80 billion for those purposes, they say they can't find $17 billion for schools; they can't find $715 million for hospitals; they can't find $3.8 billion for universities; they have $270 million in new cuts to TAFE in the most recent budget; they're taking the pensioner energy supplement off Australian seniors; and they say they can't afford to give $14 a fortnight to pensioners in this country to help them deal with energy costs—the list goes on and on and on—but they can give $17 billion to the banks. Really what I'm saying is that there is a series of warped priorities in their budget and in their approach to public policy when it comes to company tax.</span>

                    </a>  I withdraw. I consider that the commentary made by the member over there was stupid, and it was stupid for so many reasons. Principal amongst the reasons that it was stupid was that central to anything that should be proposed in this parliament is how we pay for it. I'm talking about how we pay for this measure of company tax relief for small businesses, and the point I'm making—and the point I will continue to make—is that the budget is not in especially good nick. That's a fact; it's in the government's own budget papers. Net debt has doubled. Gross debt is over half a trillion dollars for the first time in Australian history, and stays above half a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years and is higher at the end of those 10 years than it is now. I would have thought that that was pretty central to our considerations. I will continue to make that point and those opposite can take as many points of order as they like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Australian Investment Guarantee, as I have said, is all about targeting business tax relief. It's got a lot of support from the business community. We're very heartened by the support that our alternative has received, because it goes hand in hand with the measure that we're discussing. The $20,000 instant asset write-off in conjunction with the Australian Investment Guarantee is a superior way to give Australian businesses the support that they need to invest in our local economy. We've had modelling done by the Victorian University Centre of Policy Studies, which found that our policy is more effective in stimulating investment than the company tax cuts proposed by those opposite. The modelling found an investment subsidy like ours, compared to the company tax, is 'three times more effective as a stimulus to investment'. The authors of that report said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... we strongly recommend that policy-makers consider an investment subsidy instead of a cut to company tax as a better value-for-money policy initiative to increase both investment and domestic material welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a ringing endorsement. It didn't stop with the economic modelling performed by that university. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... the government should adopt the Opposition's proposed enhancements to accelerated depreciation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO of ACCI, James Pearson, welcomed the commitment from the opposition and said it was good policy. From the Council of Small Business of Australia, Peter Strong, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Industry Group supported it, as did the Property Council and the Energy Efficiency Council. The list goes on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we can afford to do the Australian investment guarantee hand-in-hand with accelerated depreciation for small businesses is that we wouldn't be proceeding down the path that those opposite proposed, which is to give the multibillion-dollar tax handout to multinationals and the big banks. We've also made some other difficult decisions and announcements in other areas of the budget to make sure that we can pay for our commitment.</span>

We agree with much of what the member for Forrest said about it and what contributions on this side have said about it. This has the capacity to make a genuine difference, so we support the bill. We're proud to be the original authors of the instant asset write-off. I support the amendment by the member for Kingsford Smith, which says:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018, which is in favour of supporting Australian small businesses. Nine out of 10 Australian businesses are small businesses. They make up over 33 per cent of Australia's GDP, employ over 40 per cent of Australia's workforce and pay over 12 per cent of total company tax revenue. We are, in short, a nation of small businesses. My electorate of Mackellar is full of hardworking and enterprising Australians who are committed to making a difference. From the boutiques of Pittwater Place to the coffee shops of Narrabeen, Mackellar, like the rest of Australia, thrives when its small businesses are performing well. Never before has supporting small business been so important. Small businesses create jobs and investment and add so much to the Australian economy. However, they are often confronted with issues such as cashflow problems and disproportionately higher compliance burdens. This is where there is a role for government to conduct sensible policy and to create the conditions for good performance and growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend tax laws to extend the period during which small businesses can access expanded accelerated depreciation rules by 12 months, to 30 June 2018. This includes the availability of an immediate deduction for depreciating assets, amounts included in the second element of a depreciating asset's costs and small business pools, with a $20,000 threshold still available rather than a $1,000 threshold. The amendment specifically focuses on businesses with an aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million to ensure that there is scope for a variety of small businesses to make the most of the changes. Such amendments will facilitate and boost the capacity of small businesses to operate for another year by providing cashflow benefits and reducing red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Depreciation can be a major issue for small businesses. Given that many are asset-reliant and have very little extra cash following asset purchases, the initial years of a business are when it is often most vulnerable and prone to failure, which is why it is important that the government enacts sensible policy to assist. Asset depreciation schemes are used around the world, such as those outlined in section 168 of the United States tax code. Other countries' providing such concessions requires us to match them in order to remain internationally competitive and to encourage investment in our small businesses and industries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a proud track record of supporting small businesses and giving all Australian entrepreneurs a fair go. We understand that the economy will not function to its full capacity without a thriving small-business sector. We also understand that it can be tough as a small-business owner to meet demands and to survive financially. The coalition is committed to reducing red tape in order to give small businesses a fair go. I know from experience how difficult it can be to go out on your own by starting a business and I know about the stress and uncertainty that can come with it. This is particularly the case when it comes to purchasing assets and the large costs associated with their maintenance. When Australians back themselves to start businesses they often make spending sacrifices in other areas of life so as to be in a position to buy those assets that are crucial to success. This can be extremely stressful and risky, and often puts individuals off pursuing business ideas in the first place.</span>

                    </a>  I appreciate your tolerance, Mr Deputy Speaker. They smother entrepreneurial spirit and the will of everyday Australians to have a go by creating businesses. This is an issue that shows that the contrast between the coalition and Labor has never been starker.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must stand up to such attempts to stifle our nation's small businesses and economic performance. If the Leader of the Opposition—whose name is Bill Shorten—and his union bosses get their way, then both our current and our future generations shall be faced with an economy riddled with uncertainty and a jobs market beset by lack of confidence. We simply cannot allow this to happen, particularly given the crossroads which our economy finds itself at. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent book by the Institute of Public Affairs and the Fraser Institute, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Demographics and Entrepreneurship: Mitigating the Effects of an Aging Population</span>, delves into Australia's declining small business entry rate. It calls for governments to cut red tape, reduce taxes and create an entrepreneurial-friendly environment to combat stagnant productivity in order to support new drivers of economic growth. If the conditions for new and small businesses are not friendly, then they simply will not grow or will go elsewhere. Individuals need to feel that the government is working for them, not against them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of Australian enterprise software company Atlassian is a remarkable one. It was founded in 2002 by Sydneysiders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar. The two started out with the ambition of replicating the $48,000 graduate starting salary typical of the big corporations, without having to work for someone else. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All their early staff were mates. They started out with a $10,000 credit card, and from there they developed their issue management software, known as Jira, reaching 2,000 paying customers by 2004. From there it was all uphill, recording revenues of $100 million in 2011, without a single salesperson, before a 2015 initial public offering on the Nasdaq stock exchange. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That Atlassian story is viewed by many as the fairytale story of Australian small business and start-ups. There is nothing more inspiring than two young Australians deciding to try their luck on their own and take on the business world. It is often said for every small business and start-up miracle there are a thousand failures. More precisely, a 2013 Google and PricewaterhouseCoopers study found only a tiny percentage of today's 1,500 technology start-ups were survivors from 2001. Yet this does not have to be the case. I want to see Australia produce more Atlassians, but this will only happen if government does its part by supporting the next Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians should feel confident that they live in a country that encourages and supports entrepreneurship and innovation. The end of the mining boom has left many wondering where the next major driver of economic growth will come from and what will happen if unexpected international shocks hit the economy. This is where small and innovative businesses should be filling the void and stepping forward to drive Australia's next era of growth. Recent OECD rankings on measures of economic complexity and sophistication place Australia 36th out of 36—dead last. Our great dependency on primary exports has resulted in what some argue to be overexposure to cyclical economic conditions. This must change, and this government supports small businesses and innovation wherever practical. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Innovation drives productivity growth and, in turn, long-term economic performance. The jobs and economic drivers of the future often stem from nations investing in and encouraging innovation entrepreneurship. The intense competitiveness of the global economy has made the need to innovate and have an adaptable economy more important than ever. We cannot rest on our laurels and assume that export sectors such as mining are going to continue to drive export growth indefinitely. Australia needs strong industries across the board, and the success of small business will underpin this. An economy full of innovative and prosperous small businesses will not only help to retain our best talent; it will also encourage the best and brightest from all around the world to view Australia as a destination for success. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians, young and old, should feel that there are ample opportunities and jobs for them here in Australia. This government recently delivered on a significant commitment. There are one million more Australians in work than there were when we were elected. This truly is a reflection of the hard work of Australian businesses and the government's strong economic management and shows how effective the two can be when working together. A record of consecutive years of growth will only continue if our industries and businesses are strong and providing jobs for Australians. This is why bills such as the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018 are so important. They showcase the commitment of this coalition government and represent an important step in ensuring the growth of this critical sector. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian business owners and entrepreneurs do it hard enough, so when government is going to step onto the scene it should be in a well-thought-out and calculated manner. This government is committed to small business and Australian jobs, while recognising the need to improve the options available for small businesses regarding asset depreciation. Without such measures, our small businesses will face an increasingly difficult and uncertain environment. I'm proud that this government is actively making changes for the benefit of small businesses and I urge the House to support the bill. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I'm pleased to rise this evening to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018 and also address some of the issues raised in the amendment by the opposition: company tax, the opposition's so-called Australian investment guarantee, relief for small businesses, business investment and so on. The subject of this bill is so wide that it would enable anyone to speak on it, and I would hope that members of the opposition do not try and make frivolous and unwarranted interventions when we are speaking on the topic of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You know why they do it? They don't want to talk about the economics, because they know that when we talk about the economics of this nation and which side of government is best for the nation, when anyone looks at the details, it is the coalition government. That is why those opposite want to try and shut this debate down and not have a wide-ranging discussion. They know, as the health minister pointed out today, that it's the hard work that the coalition government has done on the economy, on enterprise and on small business and getting that investment that has grown the economy and enabled this coalition government to finance many things in the health sector. We've been able to put many drugs on the PBS. The Labor Party was not able to put a single new drug on the PBS, leaving Australians waiting for life-saving drugs, because their blundering and incompetence when it came to economics shrunk the economy and put the budget into deep deficit. It is the coalition government, with our policies to cover investment and wealth creation, that has made the difference for those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I'll deal quickly with some issues on the amendment. The amendment that the opposition has put forward here talks about the government's company tax cut. What I see time and time again is that members of the opposition simply do not understand how incentives work in the economy. We've seen company tax rates in this nation cut from the high 40 per cents—48 and 49 per cent—down to the current 30 per cent. If you followed the opposition's logic, every single time those corporate tax rates were cut, the government would've ended up with less money because they would've been giving away all this money to big business.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this nation's history, every single time we have cut or reduced the corporate rate of tax, two things have happened: we have grown the economic pie of this nation by enabling businesses to come and invest and, more importantly, at the same time, that slice of the company tax receipts pie has grown. Today, in the economy, company tax, at 30 per cent, makes up a greater percentage of GDP than it did when it was at 36 per cent or when it was at a rate in the high 40s. Paul Keating understood that. That is why Paul Keating cut the rate of company tax.</span>

                    </a>  I hear the comment from the member for Wills, saying that former Prime Minister Paul Keating was a great Prime Minister. Paul Keating understood the importance of reducing the rate of company tax. We have seen not only Australia but almost every OECD nation this century understand the same thing. Almost every OECD nation has reduced their rate of company tax. Why? They understand that that is the way you can grow your economy. We are now faced with a situation where our corporate rate of tax of 30 per cent is no longer internationally competitive. We have seen the US reduce their rate from 35 per cent all the way down to 21 per cent. We are trying to compete against countries like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have corporate tax rates of 15 and 17 per cent. We have seen New Zealand reduce their corporate rate of tax. It was great to see the former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key here in Sydney last weekend. When he reduced the corporate rate of tax, do you know what happened in New Zealand? It was exactly the same thing that has happened here: the economy grew, and they actually ended up with more tax revenue to spend. That is more money to spend on all the things that we need to provide welfare for those Australians who are unfortunate and less well off. The greatest contrast between the Labor Party and the coalition that I can recall was spoken of in the speech from the health minister this afternoon in question time. He said that it's all about creating more wealth so we can afford to put things such as life-saving drugs on the PBS. Everyone on this side of the House should be very proud of what we've done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to have a competitive economy in the years ahead, we have to have an internationally competitive rate of corporate tax, yet we have the opposition over there doing every single thing in their power to stop that from happening. How can we have First World wages or the best public hospital system that this nation can afford if we no longer have an internationally competitive corporate rate of tax or internationally competitive energy prices? Those are the two policies that the Labor Party want to inflict upon this nation. They want to see us have the highest electricity prices in the world because their policy is to copy the failed South Australian experiment. They want us to stick to an uncompetitive international rate of corporate tax. Those policies forebode terrible things for our nation should Labor ever sit on this side of the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular bill is just another example of how the coalition is backing small business. It's through the backing of small business by this coalition government that we have seen over one million jobs created since we were elected in 2013. I remember that, back then, we said that we would set a target that, in two terms of government, the entrepreneurs would create another million new jobs in this economy. They laughed. They scoffed. They said it wasn't possible. And you know what? We have delivered that million new jobs and we've delivered it before we said that we would. You would expect the opposition to sit back and simply say: 'Well done. Congratulations. You guys got it right and we got it wrong.' That's what you would expect. You would expect them to say: 'We apologise. Coalition government, you put in the policies that created a million new jobs, something that we never dreamed of doing.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to some of the specifics of this bill. As announced in the 2018-19 budget, this bill extends a $20,000 instant asset write-off for a further 12 months, to 30 June 2019, for businesses with an aggregate turnover of less than $10 million. This is something that we need to explain, because the Labor Party thinks that any business with a turnover of more than $2 billion is a big business. They simply don't understand the difference between turnover and profit. They have no understanding whatsoever. Any business in the country listening tonight should note that if they go out and they want to make a $20,000 investment in some new capital investment for their business they will get an instant asset write-off from this government. There are around 3.3 million unincorporated businesses with an aggregate turnover of less than $10 million dollars that will be eligible for it. Every single one of those 3.3 million businesses will be eligible for that $20,000 instant asset write-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extending this threshold for a further year is the government striking a balance between helping small businesses' cashflow and investment and the revenue impact on the budget bottom line, which we are returning to surplus. We expect that the budget will be returned to surplus. We've finally turned the corner on the damage that was done by the previous Labor government, who drove the budget into deep deficit year after year after year. One year early we'll be getting that budget back into balance. And then we have the long, hard job of paying back that debt. The coalition have done it before. Going back to the previous century, in 1996, we know that the Howard government inherited a $96 billion deficit. They paid back every single cent. It took them at least six years. They not only paid back every single cent; but along the way they also had to pay back $54 billion in interest. Then they put $40 billion in the Future Fund and they had the budget in a $20 billion surplus. That is what the Labor Party inherited, and they squandered it. We are now within striking distance of getting that budget back into balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot more that the government is doing to help small business in addition to this $20 million instant asset write-off. We're also investing $20 million to help small businesses form local and regional business hubs so that entities can work together and access new export markets and global supply chains. We're providing $17.7 million to support entrepreneurs—the drivers of the economy; the wealth creators—including mentoring support and a focus on those aged over 45 years. We should be doing that, because over 45 years of age should almost be the time when many people start their entrepreneurial career, because they have the experience—the life experience, the business experience—that can help them make important entrepreneurial decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also protecting small businesses from businesses that deliberately go bust to avoid paying their bills, with tough new measures to counter illegal phoenixing. We are continuing to reduce red tape burdens across the small-business sector. We are launching FTA negotiations with the European Union. That's also another huge difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these small businesses that can take advantage of the accelerated depreciation will be working in export markets, because we, on this side of the House, understand how important it is to give Australian businesses access to markets. We have confidence that, if they get access to the markets, then they can compete on that international playing field as well as any other business from any other nation in the world. This is in contrast to what we have seen from the Labor Party. During the free trade negotiations with Japan, we had the Leader of the Opposition bring up midget subs. That was his contribution to the debate, to bring up the midget sub attack on Sydney during World War II. During the China free trade agreement discussions, the opposition quoted xenophobic statements about how, somehow or other, we shouldn't be doing that with China. We've seen the success of those free trade agreements. We've seen them give thousands of businesses opportunities to increase their exports across all sectors of the economy, and that's why we're continuing those negotiations with the European Union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also redefined 'small business' as a business with a turnover of up to $10 million, which now includes 99 per cent of all businesses. We've cut taxes for small and medium enterprises to 25 per cent and increased the unincorporated business discount to 16 per cent. I've already mentioned that we've extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off for another 12 months. And, importantly, we've abolished $5.8 billion worth of red tape—or I should more correctly say red and green tape—whereas the opposition want to tie businesses up, put more regulations on them and give them more forms to fill out, because the opposition think that form-filling is productive. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I'm really pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation that is addressing this very important issue of accelerated depreciation for small business, which makes a huge difference for businesses right around Australia. I'm also pleased to have the opportunity to speak to some of the issues raised by the absurd amendment moved by the opposition in relation to company tax more generally, and to highlight the very real contrast between this government, which is about lower taxes and more jobs, and those opposite, who are about higher taxes and fewer jobs. This is a very important contrast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn my attention to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018 that is before us. This bill is really important because, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, in small business cash is king. If, as a small business, you are considering buying a capital item, then you've got to pay for it today. If you're going to buy a coffee machine or a bunch of computers or any other sort of capital item, you need to pay for it on the day. But the way the tax system works, you generally can't claim the cost of that expenditure immediately; you have to do that over a number of years. It can be three years or five years; it varies, but you can't claim that expense immediately. While you've got the cash going out the door today, the cost from the perspective of your tax accounting actually comes through over a number of years and effectively you're out of pocket in the short term in a cash sense. That's a really difficult problem for small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does is extend the accelerated depreciation for small business entities. What we say in this bill is that any incorporated business with turnover of up to $10 million will immediately be able to expense capital expenditures of up to $20,000. There are 3.3 million businesses around the nation who are affected by this, and those businesses will be able to go forward and invest with confidence, knowing that that capital purchase can immediately go through their account and that tax deduction for the cost associated with that expenditure will immediately return to them in the form of reduced tax on their next tax bill. That's a really, really important initiative, and it's absolutely tremendous that it's being extended for a further 12 months in this important bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, of course, exists in this broader context of supporting businesses to go out there, to invest and to create jobs. We on this side of the House can speak on this issue with great authority, because in the last calendar year, 2017, more jobs were created than in any other year in Australian history. We can pick any year in the calendar in the nation's history and ask, 'Well, how many jobs were created?' Every single year will have fewer than 2017, with a huge 415,000 jobs created across this great nation in that year. A big part of the reason those jobs have been created is the pro-business and pro-investment policies of this government, and tax is an important element of those policies. Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, as you know, this government has moved very strongly to provide tax relief to businesses to ensure that they can invest, to ensure that they can compete and to ensure that they can put their best foot forward, go out there and create jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those opposite have done everything they can to oppose tax relief for Australian businesses. This isn't a theoretical thing; this isn't just what people like the Leader of the Opposition say on the daily news. This is about what they actually voted against. It's a very important point: this isn't theoretical; this is real. The opposition voted against tax relief for businesses with a turnover of $2 million or more. We hear those opposite talk about the 'big end of town' and multinationals. Those are favourite rhetorical devices for them. But they voted against tax relief for businesses with a turnover of $2 million. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, a business with turnover of $2 million is in fact a very modest-sized business. It may well be a small suburban manufacturer, it might be a distributor of goods in rural or regional areas or it might be a farm. But those opposite say that business shouldn't have any tax relief and that that business should pay one of the highest tax rates in the world, some 30 per cent. Again, that's what they voted for. It's very important that people understand this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the tax reductions that we've seen for those smaller businesses and that have filtered through into the economy—helping those businesses to be confident, helping them to invest and helping them to create good jobs—all of that good work happened despite the vehement opposition of those opposite. It's very important that the Australian people understand that for a small- or medium-sized business with $2 million in turnover or more, the policy of those opposite is to increase their tax. They voted against tax reductions for those businesses. They want to increase their taxes—that is their policy, and that is a shameful policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we know that jobs are created by the private sector. The overwhelmingly vast majority of Australians work in the private sector. They benefit when their employers invest, because you can't work for a business that doesn't exist. You can work for businesses that are investing and you can work for businesses that are creating jobs. You can't work for a business that isn't out there investing. That's why it's so important that we support small- and medium-sized—and, indeed, larger—businesses to be competitive internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oxford university recently found that Australia ranked 27th of the 33 OECD nations they looked at, with one being the lowest tax rate and 33 being the highest. Australia ranked 27th in terms of the competitiveness of our corporate tax rate. We've seen very significant movements in the tax rate in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, with tax rates going to less than 20 per cent. Corporate tax rates are less than 20 per cent in the UK and in the low 20s in the United States. Those opposite say: 'Oh, well, just leave the Australian tax rate at 30 per cent. It will make no difference.' That's what they say. It's an absurd argument, because it basically says that business does not respond to incentives to invest and that the cost of doing business is irrelevant to business. That's what those opposite say, and that's just an absurd argument. Anyone who thinks at the most basic level of common sense can appreciate the bankruptcy of the position of those opposite. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this isn't theoretical. They actually voted along these lines. They voted for it. They voted to say a business worth $2 million should pay 30 per cent tax. They did. It's a very inconvenient truth, but they voted to seek to ensure that a business with $2 million of turnover maintains a 30 per cent tax rate, which is one of the very highest in the world. That's what they think is good for Australia. It's very important to remember this. The member for Kingsford Smith, no doubt seeking to make some sort of contribution to the debate, moved this amendment, but it's pleasing in that it gives me the opportunity to reflect on the absolute failure of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all. There's quite a bit more to talk about on this topic of tax and the failings of those opposite. They say that capital gains tax should go up by 50 per cent for everyone. The policy is called 'housing affordability', so that might make you think it's just about housing. It turns out it's not. It turns out it's actually about every form of investment in the entire Australian economy. So, in order to encourage investment and in order to encourage jobs, they say: increase tax on capital gains—50 per cent on everything! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone might say, 'I want to invest in getting a new factory off the ground,' maybe in suburban Perth, and they might seek some investment from people to get that factory off the ground so they can go out and employ 20 or 30 people to get that factory happening. What those opposite say is that the person who invests in that factory should pay 50 per cent more tax on their investment. That is just an absurd policy. This just shows the paucity of understanding of the most basic economic principles over there. If you want people to invest more—and we do want people to invest more because we want more jobs—you don't say to them, 'Well, hey, here's what we're going to do. We're going to make you pay 50 per cent more tax.' But that's what they've done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect that, when their so-called housing affordability policy came out, some of the members opposite didn't actually realise that the 50 per cent capital gains tax increase would apply to absolutely everything in the economy. But, if they have any confusion about that, they should consult with the shadow Treasurer, and he will confirm that their plan is to increase tax by 50 per cent. So, if you've got a small business in Braddon or in Longman, or perhaps you're involved in some sort of business in the Adelaide Hills, and you're seeking investment, it's very important that people understand that under those opposite those investors who come forward to invest in, to help that business, would pay 50 per cent more tax. It's an absolutely ridiculous policy!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We say less tax means more investment. We say that the money in the economy is not the property of the government. It is generated by the hard work of individuals. It is generated by the hard work of businesses all around Australia. It's their money. It is not the government's money. Now, of course, government must charge some tax in order to manage the operations of the government and provide those essential services upon which we rely, but it is not our money; it is their money. We must respect the fact that it is those individuals and businesses who have gone out there and created that economic activity. The last thing we should do—the last thing any sensible government would do—is seek to penalise those people who are going out there and investing and creating jobs by hitting them over the head with more and higher taxes. It's the wrong thing to do. Certainly, on this side of the House, we will never behave in that way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proof of the pudding is 415,000 jobs created last year—the greatest number of jobs in Australian history. Those opposite should be celebrating. They should be saying to the government, 'We will back your economic policies because they're working.' It's the logical thing to do, isn't it? If something is working, you do more of it. The economic policies of this government are very, very successful. We have very strong job creation, and that is great news because it means more opportunities for Australian families, more opportunities for people to pursue their dreams and a greater sense of wellbeing across our community. These are all very, very good things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor want to increase company taxes by $59 billion. They want to talk about the so-called 'big end of town' whilst they're hitting over the head basically everyone, even retirees who have done the right thing: they've worked hard, saved and put away for their retirement. Labor come along and say, 'Oh, gee, there's a very attractive pot of money over there with those retirees. How do we get that and how do we get it straightaway?' The retiree tax is not grandfathered. There's no phasing in. No—bang; it's straightaway, under those opposite. They will take billions and billions of dollars from the retirement savings of ordinary Australians who have done nothing wrong. They've played by the rules, they've worked hard, they've supported their families and they've put a little bit away for their retirement. The shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition want to come in and take billions and billions of dollars from those hardworking, ordinary Australians. You can see a massive contrast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kingsford Smith, in his perhaps misguided enthusiasm, has invited us to talk about the big contrast on company tax and tax in general. We created a record number of jobs last year. A big part of that is our support for small business through tax relief. This bill will provide more tax relief. It's absolutely the right thing to do. I'm pleased to speak in support of the bill. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  I'm really pleased to rise and speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Accelerated Depreciation for Small Business Entities) Bill 2018. I'm pleased to do it because it's part of our plan for jobs and growth. We know that our policies are working. We've seen record jobs growth in the last 12 months—some 420,000 jobs, in fact, throughout Australia over the last 12 months, with the vast majority of those being in small and family owned businesses. Funnily enough for senators and MPs on the other side of the House, most of those jobs have been created in businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. Why is that so significant? Because that's where we've reduced company tax, in businesses up to $50 million. They are the ones who are employing people. They're the ones giving people a head start, a job and aspiration as they move from one job to another. What's really interesting as well is that today those opposite opposed $140 billion in income tax cuts. They want to make sure that Australians don't keep their own money. They want to actually take more of your money—your hard-earned income tax. They don't want to pass that through the Senate, and it's an absolute shame. We know that hardworking Australians do extremely well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked a little bit today about aspiration. The Deputy Leader opposite said she has no idea what that means or what it is, or she has no aspiration. The fact is that I know people who were earning $40,000 about six years ago and now they're on well over $80,000. Other people I know were on $90,000 and are now on over a couple of hundred thousand dollars. So aspiration is a good thing for everyone. For every young person in this country, for everyone who wants to get ahead, for everyone who has a goal or a dream, this is important. That's why we're eliminating bracket creep and providing aspiration to the people who want to do it. The Labor Party stand opposed to it because we know that, heading to the next election in next 10 months, they're for higher taxes and we're for lower taxes; they're for more spending of your money and taxing you more and we're for better management of your money and want to see the economy come back to surplus next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this bill in particular and company tax, we also know that small businesses aren't just businesses under $2 million, like those opposite would have you believe. It's an absolute fantasy. They need to get out in the real world. This bill will apply to all businesses earning up to $10 million. I want to say to the businesses in my electorate: you've got a great opportunity in the next week and a half. Go grab it. Before 30 June, next Saturday, you've got the opportunity to buy products—and it can be any product you like—up to $20,000 and you can instantly write it off this financial year, rather than having your accountant depreciate it over three, four or five years, or whatever is applicable. This is a good measure that was extended in this year's budget, so it will go next year as well. The Treasurer put it forward, and I'm very pleased to support it. But businesses should take advantage of it in the next week and a half. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of opportunities for businesses in my electorate and, I'm sure, in every member's electorate to take advantage of this measure. In my electorate, I have some fantastic artists. I have a lady called Jo St Baker. She is an individual artist who runs a business out of Mon Komo Hotel in Redcliffe. She does some fantastic artwork in relation to the local environment, the local seaside of the Redcliffe Peninsula. She has pieces from a couple of hundred dollars up to a few thousand. You might find that a business has just fitted out their office and they want a new piece of artwork for their front foyer. They can go down and see Jo St Baker and pick up a piece and instantly write that off this year, which is important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lady called Sharron Tancred, from Tailored Artworks. Sharron is a lovely lady and does some fantastic work. She's a really good networker. She lives just over in Murrumba Downs and goes to the North Lakes Chamber of Commerce. Tailored Artworks customises artworks and transforms spaces. A business might put in a new kitchen—we'll get to new kitchens in a moment—that has a splashback and they want to create a special art piece for it. They will be able to take advantage of the instant asset tax write-off, if Sharron can get it done within the next week and a half. I imagine she would be pretty busy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're a business and you need a new kitchen, people like Kingswood Cabinets at Narangba in my electorate have a whole range of different kitchen products for a few thousand dollars. Not only will you be able to give business to them and instantly write it off this year; you will also be able to give the local carpenter or installers some work, which is important as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses may be after a new car or a second-hand car. They could go and see Village Motors at North Lakes or Jeep and VW down near Redcliffe at Kippa-Ring. There are a whole load of car dealers in my electorate. There's Mazda at Aspley as well. People may be able to pick up a new vehicle for under $20,000—a small single-cab petrol ute—or a second-hand vehicle. They've got a week and a half to do so and take advantage of the instant asset tax write-off. Not only that, they can whack a new bull bar on the front. In my electorate, there's East Coast Bullbars at Clontarf, and also Ultimate Bullbars at Narangba, who make custom bull bars. I'm very fond of what East Coast Bullbars do in particular, because they employ over 100 people. They make the best world's alloy bull bars right in the Petrie electorate. So people can once again take advantage of the instant asset tax write-off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, if this wasn't extended, businesses buying these products would have to depreciate them over seven years. For the member for Kennedy, these are Australian made and manufactured bull bars; they are made right here in my electorate. I know he is always on about manufacturing. He should be jumping for joy on this one. We've also got Kennedy's Timbers at Narangba, which sell a whole lot of recycled timber, which is fantastic. If a business is looking to do up their foyer with some new timber, they could take advantage of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can also buy new computers, new servers or new monitors, perhaps from one of the Harvey Norman stores or from an individual small business that sells computers in my electorate. You may want to reward the staff and get them a new coffee machine. I have a great coffee roaster in my electorate, Neli Coffee at Clontarf, that also sell machines. If you want to buy a coffee machine for $1,500, rather than depreciating it over a few years, you can instantly write that off in the next week and a half. Because the government has a plan for small business, it will be extended next year as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another good manufacturer in my electorate is Polyworld at Clontarf. They sell all types of water tanks. If you want to get a water tank for your business—you may be using a lot of water—you can hook it up to the roof, catch some of that water and use it in your business. You will not only be providing some work for Polyworld but also for those individual plumbers that will install it for you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know businesses are very sensitive with energy prices at the moment. Energy prices are a real issue. I've spoken on this. We need to make sure that we have reliable, affordable energy, as well as renewable energy. We need to make sure that we adopt the government's RET and not go to the reckless 50 per cent renewable target of those opposite, which will continue to send prices up. When those opposite were in government, energy prices doubled for businesses in my electorate. You might want to take advantage of Springers Solar or Sunelec in Clontarf, local businesses who sell solar. They can put it on your roof. If you are a business, I would encourage you to take advantage of that now. Most businesses operate between 8 or 9 am and 5 pm—I know the days are a bit short in winter. That is the perfect place to install solar because, as you are producing it, you can use it at the same time. Don't worry about selling it back into the grid; just use it as you create it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole range of businesses in my electorate where people can take advantage of the instant asset tax write-off. I am very pleased to support this bill. I know that it is creating jobs. It is part of the government's plan. Once again, I go back to the 420,000 jobs created in the last 12 months. This stuff doesn't just happen by accident; it was a detailed plan in relation to jobs and economic growth that centred around business tax cuts. We have seen the advantage in cutting company tax for businesses up to $50 million. Again, that is where the jobs are being created. The instant asset tax write-off is benefiting businesses as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free trade agreements have also been beneficial. Moreton Bay Seafoods in my electorate sells prawns and so forth into China. They have been able to take advantage of that, which is really important. In defence manufacturing, I am very pleased that the government will be building the Land 400 project at Ipswich. That is good news for Queensland, and there are businesses in my electorate that will be able to take advantage of the supply chain as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen the free trade agreements helping in agriculture. A lot of people in my electorate really care about farming. We have seen some boosts to agriculture because of free trade agreements as well. Our plan around defence manufacturing, our plan around free trade agreements in agriculture and our plan around business tax cuts are all producing jobs and economic growth. The more economic growth we get, the more income tax and company tax we have. That's why next year we will be balancing the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is all at risk if the Labor Party is elected. We know they are reckless. We know they don't understand small businesses. If they did, they would certainly be supporting the instant asset tax write-off for businesses up to $10 million. It is outrageous that they think only businesses under $2 million should take advantage of this opportunity. This is good policy. I support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  In summing up, it is wonderful to follow the member for Petrie's very eloquent contribution and I want to thank all other members for their contribution to the debate on this bill. With 3.3 million small businesses employing 5.7 million Australian workers, the small business sector contributes in many important ways to every single town, community and city and to the entire country. The government is committed to continuing to back these Australian businesses. We have legislated tax cuts as part of our 10-year enterprise tax plan to reduce their tax bill. The government has increased the unincorporated small business tax discount and lifted the small business entity turnover threshold, very importantly, to $10 million. By backing these small businesses, they can invest more, grow more, employ more Australians and, ultimately, pay higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the opposition, sadly, doesn't have a plan for a stronger economy and delivering jobs. At every opportunity, they seek to attack these small businesses who are, in the end, the engine room of job creation in our economy more broadly. We know that the Labor Party used to believe in competitive company tax rates. The Leader of the Opposition, as the Minister for Financial Services when Labor was last in government, said in March 2012: 'Any student of Australian business and economic history knows that part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate. We need to be able to make life easier for Australian business, which employs two in every three Australians.' He was dead right. In 2013, the shadow Treasury spokesperson also wanted to cut the company tax rate, saying: 'It's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.' But that is unbelievable. The Labor thing, in the end, is not about reducing company taxes but playing politics, and this is a very, very sad class-envy approach. The problem is that because Labor can't control their spending, they won't commit to a speed limit on taxes, and this is a recipe for higher and higher taxes that in the end we know will suffocate our economy, as the Treasurer has often said, just like a snake eating its tail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we have a plan for a stronger economy and we have a plan to guarantee the essentials and deliver tax relief. This bill is part of a suite of measures that the government's taking to deliver on our plan for a stronger economy by backing small business. The bill will extend the instant asset write-off for a further 12 months, to 30 June 2019. It will also allow immediate deductibility for assets below the $20,000 threshold. Extending this $20,000 instant asset write-off means we're continuing to help small businesses reinvest in their business and replace or upgrade their assets, making their business, in many cases, more efficient and more productive. Small businesses with annual turnover less than $10 million will be able to immediately deduct purchases of eligible assets which cost less than $20,000, with the requirement that they are first used or installed and ready for use by 30 June 2019. Assets valued at $20,000 or more can continue to be placed into the small business simplified depreciation pool and depreciated at 15 per cent in the first income year and 30 per cent in each income year thereafter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $20,000 instant asset write-off is a phenomenally successful initiative that is supported by the small business sector. The extension of this measure benefits hardworking Australian small businesses, boosting their activity and their investment for another year. In this sense, the government has a plan for a stronger economy and a plan to enable and encourage small businesses to contribute to that and to keep business competitive, which grows jobs and grows wages as well. I therefore commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should give extra support to businesses wanting to cut pollution. One of the best ways that businesses can take steps to cut pollution is by investing in new assets, and one of the best ways that parliament can support that is by giving targeted tax breaks to industries and businesses that decide to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This series of amendments does two things. One is that it extends up to $30,000 the amount of expenditure that a business can invest in their capital to be entitled to get the write-off. The second thing it does is to make it permanent. So we're not just dealing with a year-by-year potential instant asset write-off; we're dealing with something that businesses now know will be there in perpetuity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures that have been announced and legislated so far, and that have been in place for some time, certainly have the support of the Greens. One of the reasons we've supported that is we know it enables investment in renewable energy technology by businesses, and also in some areas of energy efficiency. The Smart Energy Council, for example, has been rightly promoting the availability of the write-off to enable the investment in some forms of generation of renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the challenges we've got in this country at the moment is that the government does not have a policy to reduce emissions in industry. We used to have a policy that would do that. We used to have a carbon price that applied across the economy. We used to have funds that were established precisely to support businesses that wanted to invest in products or new equipment that would reduce the amount of energy that they used. This government got rid of all of that. The problem is that it's put nothing in its place—absolutely nothing. When you have stationary energy, excluding electricity, accounting for about 18 per cent of Australia's pollution, and industrial processes accounting for about another seven per cent, you've got up to 25 per cent of Australia's pollution, currently without any meaningful policy to reduce it. But you've got many businesses in that sector wanting to do the right thing. There is a lot of opportunity in that sector, if we had some policy, to actually start bringing down our pollution and reducing the power bills of businesses in that sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that we need to start encouraging our businesses to do is fuel switching. There is ample opportunity for many businesses to switch off gas and onto electricity, and if we then make our electricity powered by renewables, that will reduce Australia's pollution. Some good work has been done on this front by government agencies, including ARENA, that shows many businesses currently use gas not even as a feed stock; they use gas for low-temperature industrial processes where you could substitute electricity. They might use it to create steam, for example, as part of their industrial processes. If we could get people off gas and onto electricity, and if we could make that electricity more renewable, then we could help bring down pollution in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that a lot of businesses are increasingly seeing power bills going through the roof and wanting to take steps themselves to bring down their power bills through energy efficiency. It might not be fuel switching from gas to electricity; it might be straight energy efficiency measures. We should actively take steps to encourage those businesses that want to do that. That's why these amendments would extend the amount that a business is able to claim if they want to invest in energy efficiency measures and make that deduction available to them permanently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll say this in conclusion: the Greens do not support giving an across-the-board company tax cut. That is not the right way to go, especially because we know that a big chunk of the money from that company tax cut is going to flow overseas and is not going to do anything to grow the Australian economy. What we do support is targeted tax incentives, which is why we've supported the R&amp;D tax incentive over many years, and why we're now proposing that we should extend a series of measured tax incentives to those businesses that are wanting to take active steps to reduce their pollution by investing in new capital equipment for things like fuel switching or energy efficiency. That is a much better way to stimulate the economy and support the growth of a clean economy without the additional, unnecessary and unfair cost of an across-the-board corporate tax cut.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2018 includes four measures: a one-off 12-month superannuation guarantee amnesty to encourage employers who have not paid their employees the SG to do so; allowing employees who have multiple employers to apply to the tax commissioner for an exemption certificate from the SG for one or more of their employees, so as to avoid breaching the concessional contributions cap; ensuring that the non-arm's-length income rules for superannuation entities apply in situations where the superannuation entity incurs non-arm's-length expenses in gaining or producing the income; and amending the total superannuation balance rules to prevent self-managed super fund members from being able to use limited recourse borrowing arrangements to circumvent the $1.6 million transfer balance cap and the unused concessional carry forward rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have no problem with three out of the four measures contained in this bill and have no problem supporting those measures through both houses. Avoiding a breach of the concessional contributions cap, the non-arm's-length income rules and the limited recourse borrowing arrangement changes are sensible provisions and we support them. But we have a very fundamental problem with the first measure—the amnesty for employers who have not paid their workers the superannuation guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very clear: superannuation is the member's money; it is the employee's money. Superannuation is a condition of employment. It is part of an individual's remuneration. Not paying the superannuation guarantee is wages theft. Not paying the superannuation guarantee is theft from your employees. It should not be provided with an amnesty. If anything, it should be provided with greater penalties for noncompliance. This amnesty would be a penalty holiday for people who had not provided the superannuation guarantee for up to 25 years. Somebody who has never paid the superannuation guarantee to their employees would be able to benefit from this amnesty. This is a serious problem.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been various mechanisms to look at this problem. There was a Senate Economics Committee inquiry into superannuation guarantee nonpayment. It made a series of recommendations—some of which the government supports and some of which we support, but most of which were good-faith sensible recommendations. What was not recommended was an amnesty. At no point did the Senate committee recommend an amnesty. The Turnbull government's own Superannuation Guarantee Cross-Agency Working Group did not recommend an amnesty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is making changes that will mean that an employer could have kept superannuation entitlements from an employee for more than 25 years and now will not face any penalty at all if they pay it back. Usually when an employer does not does not meet their superannuation guarantee requirements—and it is found that they have not paid it; it's reported—there are two things that happen: a superannuation guarantee charge is levied, and that is not tax deductible if the superannuation guarantee charge is levied in that circumstance; and additional penalties of up to 200 per cent of the amount of the superannuation guarantee charge can be levied. The government's proposed amnesty will have the effect that the employer in question will be able to claim a tax deduction for the superannuation guarantee charge and avoid penalties. So they are going to make it tax deductible and take the penalties away. Honourable members might recall that we asked the Prime Minister about this in question time a few weeks ago. It was quite clear that the Prime Minister had absolutely no idea what we were talking about. He was unaware that this was his government's policy. It was one of the more embarrassing question times. Although today might have surpassed it, it was a pretty embarrassing question time for the Prime Minister.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a fundamental issue with this. I would say that over my 14 years in this House I would have seen—as many honourable members certainly on this side of the House would have seen—scores of people who have not been paid their superannuation guarantee and who have been at their wits' end about how to get their employer to pay their superannuation guarantee. You work with those people and you refer them to the tax office. A lot of women are affected by this in lower-paid, precarious employment, and employers think that they have the whip hand over those employees and that they don't have to pay the superannuation guarantee. It is a big problem. We're not talking about a few people. The Productivity Commission's draft report on superannuation estimates that, conservatively, there is $2.8 billion a year in unpaid superannuation. They did a model simulation of somebody aged between 21 and 25 whose employer did not pay 50 per cent of contributions and would have a retirement balance of $63,000 less than somebody who got all of their contributions, and, if they didn't get any of their contributions at all, they'd be self-evidently close to $120,000 behind. What we do not believe is that an amnesty is an appropriate way to deal with this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If an employer has legitimate reasons, if an employer has made a very legitimate administrative mistake—there's been a natural disaster and their systems have been affected in some way—then, of course, people would understand, but not when an employer has knowingly engaged in theft from their employees and has knowingly engaged in noncompliance with the law of the land. This parliament legislated that the superannuation guarantee should be universal and compulsory, and 'universal and compulsory' means it should be paid to everyone. It's not an option. There are certain workplace conditions in this country which are not optional anymore. Workplace health and safety rules used to be optional. This parliament and state parliaments have improved working conditions. Working hours are regulated; conditions are regulated; there are obligations on employers and employees. You don't pick and choose. It's not a smorgasbord of what you're going to comply with or not going to comply with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could look at the issue of superannuation guarantee noncompliance and say, 'Well, we could increase penalties, we could look at the Senate committee recommendations and we could look at the recommendations of our own working group. We could do all of those sensible things. We could engage with the opposition and we might get a bit of bipartisanship. This is a very serious issue and the opposition are very interested in working with people, with goodwill, across the board to try to fix it. We could do all of those things.' But, no, what does the government do? With no warning, with no indication of any consultation with anybody—certainly no public consultation—and with no process of draft legislation, they simply say, 'We're going to let people off. We're not going to enforce the law of the land.' It's been the law of the land for 25 years. 'We're not going to require employers to pay the superannuation guarantee of their employees. If they haven't, we're going to provide them with a penalty holiday. We're going to make it tax deductible and we're going to waive the penalties.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, frankly, appalling. This is just an appalling piece of legislation. This legislation is an affront. It's an affront to the House and it's an affront to the hardworking Australians who deserve a dignified retirement. We are not talking about luxury; we are talking about people, often on low incomes, who, the parliament decided, under a Labor government, deserved a dignified retirement by having some money put aside for them from every pay packet for their future retirement, and it was legislated. I recognise and accept that the Liberal and National parties opposed that legislation. They opposed compulsory universal superannuation. They argued against it. They said it was a con job. They said we shouldn't have dignified retirement. They said superannuation should be kept the preserve of the few. That's what they argued when the Keating government legislated for compulsory universal superannuation. They made that argument and they lost, and it has been the law of the land for 25 years, like it or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament should be saying to everybody, 'If you breach the law, there's a consequence. If this parliament passes a law, we expect it to be complied with.' That's how the system is meant to work. You can't pick and choose which laws you comply with. This is a government who say they're tough on law and order. They lecture us about the people they don't like and how we should be tough on unions and they hold royal commissions, but, if you have an employer who's not complying with the law and is ripping off employees, that's okay—'We're going to let them off.' Well, it's not okay and it won't be okay if we have anything to say about it in this House or the other House. We don't think that this should be the law of the land—that all of a sudden it's optional as to whether you comply with the superannuation guarantee. There is a difference of approach here. The Andrews government in Victoria has announced that it will criminalise wage theft. The Foley opposition in New South Wales have announced that, if they're elected, they will criminalise wage theft in New South Wales. Yet this government says superannuation theft is just fine. Just fine. No penalties. No reason to comply with the law. Don't worry about it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amnesty applies for 12 months, but it applies retrospectively for 25 years. What's to say that, when this 12-month period is over, the government's not going to do this again in a few years time? This legislation sends all the wrong signals about the importance of the superannuation guarantee. It sends all the wrong signals about all the wrong priorities of this government. I move:</span>

There are some measures in this bill that we support, but the government should go further. They should accept the recommendations of their own inquiry, the Murray inquiry into financial system, as well. I can feel that the honourable gentleman here, the member for Scullin, is very keen to second the amendment. I commend the amendment to the House, and I hope the government sees sense and actually thinks that the law of the land should be complied with, implemented and policed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  The Turnbull government is committed to the financial security of all Australians. This was acutely evident in 2018 budget handed down last month, a budget that builds on a strong economy—an economy now in its 27th consecutive growth year. It's a budget that supports Australian businesses to grow and capitalise on global growth. Global growth is now the fastest in six years. It's a budget that continues to create jobs, to build on last year's average of 1,100 extra jobs every single day. This is a budget that plans for the future and the future prosperity of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An essential part of that planning is to ensure all Australians have adequate retirement savings courtesy of our superannuation system, a fair superannuation system with reliable measures and enforcement regimes to protect the hard-earned savings of all Australians—measures such as placing a cap on superannuation account fees and a ban on exit fees; changing life insurance in superannuation from being a default option to an opt-in option for those who have low balances or have not received a recent contribution, or those under the age of 25; giving the ATO greater powers to consolidate lost superannuation accounts into active accounts; and compelling superannuation funds to provide more information to help consumers compare and choose products that best suit their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is introducing a suite of measures to further protect our hard-earned savings and help ensure that all workers get their full superannuation guarantee entitlements, and this bill does just that. Firstly—and this is important—this government will provide a 12-month superannuation guarantee amnesty for employers to voluntarily come forward to remedy historical nonpayment of their workers' superannuation. Those who fess up, those who cop it on the chin, those who voluntarily come forward and make good on historical nonpayments will not face the usual penalties. But here's the kicker: if they miss their chance, those employers who do not fess up will be found out and will face higher penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is expected that $230 million in retirement savings will be recouped for some 50,000 hardworking Australians under this superannuation guarantee amnesty. Some will argue, including the opposition—and we've heard it already from the shadow Treasurer—that this measure is in some way weakening penalties for noncompliance. Nothing could be further from the truth. How the shadow Treasurer, how the Labor Party, how the union movement could stand in the way of 50,000 Australians recouping their own hard-earned savings is beyond belief. There is no weakening. This is simply an incentive for employers to come forward voluntarily to pay all historical entitlements, with interest, in full, to employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will deliver a real difference to the savings, financial security and retirement plans of at least 50,000 Australians who would otherwise miss out on a combined $230 million in superannuation entitlements if it were not for the amnesty proposed by this bill. Any suggestion, as the shadow Treasurer implied, that this is letting employers off the hook is patently untrue and wrong. Employers will only get the benefit of the amnesty if they pay their employees' entitlements in full and with interest and if they voluntarily disclose their noncompliance—that is, they aren't already under investigation by the ATO. Here we have $230 million that can be given back to those people, those 50,000 hardworking Australians, who have actually earned it for their savings, and who stands in the way right now? The Labor Party and the union movement. The very people who purport to represent hardworking Australians are the ones standing in the way of $230 million being returned. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill recognises that some employees may inadvertently breach their concessional contributions caps when they have multiple employers contributing to their superannuation. This bill streamlines the process and allows employees to opt out of the superannuation guarantee system by applying to the ATO for an exemption certificate to avoid such breaches. Once an exemption has been granted, employees can negotiate higher take-home pay in lieu of these contributions, if they so wish. Once again, this measure will provide a practical solution to a very real problem and, thereby, make a real difference to the financial security of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, this bill protects the integrity of the 2016 superannuation taxation reform package. I remind the House that this package was supported by the opposition. The changes before us today will ensure that super funds cannot evade contribution caps by using non-arm's-length expenditure to enhance their total income. This bill also ensures that limited recourse borrowing arrangements aren't used inappropriately to access concessional cap carry-forward arrangements, or to circumvent caps on non-concessional contributions. These measures improve confidence in the system and ensure it is fair, equitable and used for its core purpose: to provide income security in retirement, whatever one's circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite don't have a good track record when it comes to the security of Australians' retirement savings. I do not need to remind the House, or the Australian people for that matter, of Labor's plans to abolish dividend imputation credits and increase capital gains tax as part of their so-called tax plan. As the Institute of Public Affairs astutely points out:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All 15 million prospective retirees who hold a superannuation account stand to be affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate office has been contacted by hundreds of constituents, many elderly and meagre of means, all worried about their retirement savings and superannuation balances should Labor ever win government. Some of them were in fact traditional Labor voters, many of whom were pained to concede that the Labor Party had no idea of what it was doing. We know those opposite are very keen to immediately raise the superannuation guarantee rate in a historic low-wage-growth environment, even in the face of warning of their own so-called experts—the Grattan Institute, for example—that it would affect the retirement savings of Australians, particularly low-paid workers. In fact, under a Labor government, the superannuation guarantee rate was projected to increase to 11½ per cent at the end of this month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And who pays for these increases? The employees pay for these increases with less take-home pay. There is less disposable income for workers—that's what Labor delivers, and Labor knows that. I really believe those opposite understand that their tax plan is going to adversely impact hardworking Australians. But they were happy, and they remain happy, to see that happen. The Leader of the Opposition knows that all too well himself, because he admitted it back when he was Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, during an interview with Neil Mitchell on 3AW in 2012. Neil Mitchell says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Okay. So you're saying that the superannuation increases will be paid for by absorbing money out of the wage increases.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2018, includes four measures. The first is the one-off 12-month superannuation guarantee amnesty to encourage those employers who haven't paid their employee super to do so. The second allows employees who have multiple employers to apply to the tax commissioner for an exemption certificate from the SG from one or more of their employers. This helps to avoid breaching the concessional contributions cap. The third ensures that non-arms-length income rules for superannuation entities apply in situations where a superannuation entity incurs more arms-length expenses in gaining or producing the income. And the fourth amends the total superannuation balance rules to prevent self-managed super fund members being able to use limited recourse borrowing arrangements to circumvent the $1.6 million transfer balance cap and the unused concessional cap carry-forward rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The three latter amendments have merit, but Labor is certainly opposed to the first principle in this legislation of providing an amnesty for employers who have not been paying their workers the superannuation guarantee. It is clear that what the government is doing with this is basically letting dodgy employers off the hook from prosecution for breaking the law. There is a well-enshrined law in Australia that has been in place for the last 25 years that says employers are obliged to pay superannuation once they're above certain thresholds. And this government now wants to give those employers who have been breaking the law a free pass. You can get away with breaking the law under a Turnbull government because they'll give you an amnesty for it in respect of not paying superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It shouldn't be a surprise that this government has consistently supported big business and corporations over workers, which is what they're again doing with this particular aspect of this legislation. The fact is that this government is more concerned with the ideology of removing regulations on big businesses and giving handouts to big businesses through their corporate tax cuts than actually ensuring that people are paid properly, that people are paid legally, as they should be, under legislation. Instead of cracking down on bosses who have clearly done the wrong thing, the government is handing out leave passes. It wants to give employers who have not paid superannuation to their employees for 25 years a penalty holiday—that's right, 25 years, a quarter of a century. So you can be an employer who hasn't paid your employees' superannuation for the last quarter of a century and you will get away with it under this government. Imagine if the average taxpayer or the average small businessman didn't pay tax for a quarter of a century and then just rocked up to the Australian tax office and said: 'They're letting the employers off from paying superannuation. How about you give me a break. I'm not going to pay back any of the tax that I haven't paid to the government over the course of the last 25 years.' You would be laughed out of town—and so you should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when it comes to superannuation, those bosses who haven't been paying superannuation for the last quarter of a century will get a break and be free from prosecution. That says everything about this government's approach to big business and their approach to superannuation. We all know that they've never really supported superannuation. They don't believe in the philosophy of compulsory superannuation contributions. They certainly don't believe in industry funds. At every opportunity they reduce the number of people who pay into industry funds and reduce the mechanisms to put people into industry funds. They oppose them. Superannuation theft is as bad as wages theft—and it is illegal. Why should dodgy employers get away with stealing hard-earned money from their employees? Why should employers who have ripped off their workers be given a tax break when the Australian average worker or small business isn't when it comes to paying their fair share of taxes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government just can't help themselves when it comes to giving more to business at the expense of Australian workers. And it is a common theme. For too long they ignored Labor's push for a royal commission into the banking industry. Their history on this has already been written. The evidence shows that the Turnbull government continues to get this and other big calls wrong when it comes to financial services regulation and acting in the interests of workers, families and small businesses. They even shut down calls to action on a royal commission from their own backbench. Calls to action from the likes of Senator Williams have been coming from their party room for many years. For 600 days they said there was no need for a royal commission. Given the evidence that has been given before the royal commission so far, Labor has been completely vindicated in our calls for a royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And here we are with an amnesty for dodgy employers, a surprise announcement that was made without consultation. It came completely out of left field with not a mention at all to the industry, to workers or, indeed, to the opposition. There was no mention of it in the budget. It was presumably a decision that was taken but not yet announced. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no recent parliamentary reports into unpaid super that actually recommend such a measure. The superannuation guarantee amnesty wasn't recommended by the Senate Economics Committee when they looked at superannuation and nonpayment. They conducted an inquiry into this, and they didn't even recommend it. Neither was it recommended by the government's own superannuation cross-agency working group, and recent reports of the announcement on the amnesty was a surprise even to the industry—peak organisations like the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA, the Financial Services Council or Industry Super Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the Turnbull government decided this at the last minute. It was decided by the minister as another break for big businesses that haven't been paying the right amount of superannuation for their employees. They didn't even bother to consult with key stakeholders in the industry. They will always place ideology above effective policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Usually, when employers don't meet their superannuation guarantee obligations, they can be liable for penalties and charges: the SG charge, comprised of the SG shortfall, nominal interest and a $20 per employee per quarter administrative component. Penalties can be up to 200 per cent of the amount of superannuation guarantee charge that is not paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are general interest charges where the SG charge or penalties are not paid by the due date. Under the government's proposed amnesty, the administrative component of the SG charge and the penalties would be waived as well. Even worse, the SG charge and contributions offset against the SG charge would become tax deductible for employers, so dodgy employers get a tax break for doing the wrong thing. Yes, it's another unfair, undeserved tax handout from this government to large corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is out of touch. You've got to laugh at the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister coming in here and saying that Labor has been out of touch when it comes to economic policy and tax policy. We are the ones opposing the big tax cut for large companies, which is overwhelmingly opposed by the Australian public, particularly Australian workers, who haven't been getting wage increases for the last decade, really. They can see that it's unfair to be handing out a tax cut for big businesses. Only someone as out of touch as the Prime Minister would be seriously suggesting a reform such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses who do the wrong thing and steal from workers should pay the price for their misconduct, not get another tax handout from this government. When employees steal from employers, they rightfully have the book thrown at them and they are prosecuted. Why is it one rule for businesses and another rule for workers? The government is really saying that it's okay to steal from workers but it's not okay for employees to steal from their bosses—as it shouldn't be; no worker should ever steal from their boss. But this government is going to allow employers to steal from their workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unpaid super is a massive problem across Australia. Recent estimates point to 2.4 million workers losing about $5.6 billion in superannuation payments each year. That's equal to those workers losing $2,000 per year; that's money that should be going into their retirement savings. Superannuation is part of a worker's pay and conditions and every worker deserves the right to superannuation that they are entitled to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wish to finish with some final comments about the limited recourse borrowing arrangements. Schedule 4 of the bill amends the total superannuation balance rules that were introduced as part of the government's 2016 super reforms. The changes in schedule 4 are integrity measures to ensure that—in certain circumstances, involving LRBAs—the total value of a superannuation fund's assets is taken into account in working out individual members' superannuation balances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that in 2014 the Financial System Inquiry recommended that super funds not be permitted to use LRBAs at all. They observed:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further growth in superannuation funds' direct borrowing would, over time, increase risk in the financial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, unfortunately, the government rejected that inquiry recommendation. Labor announced that we would prohibit this, as part of our housing affordability. This will prevent the unnecessary build-up of risk in Australia's superannuation industry. Labor created superannuation and will always defend it, and that's why we support the three other measures in this bill but we can't support the measure which allows wages theft from employees.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Australia is a nation built on free and fair expression. Without this principle, the very foundation of our nation crumbles. Australia has a long, proud history of working with other nations to improve democratic processes and freedoms. One country we have worked with tirelessly to improve democracy is Cambodia. In 1991, in the aftermath of Pol Pot's dreadful Khmer Rouge regime, Australia played an important stewardship role for the Paris Peace Accords, a key limb of which was to guarantee free and fair elections in Cambodia. Sadly, that commitment has not yet been realised for the Cambodian people. Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People's Party have acted to shut down democracy in Cambodia in the lead-up to the general election scheduled for next month. He has dissolved a major opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, or the CNRP, and imprisoned its leader, Mr Kem Sokha, on ridiculous treason charges over a speech that Mr Sokha delivered here in Australia in 2013. Amid international condemnation, the regime has shut down international NGOs and media organisations, imprisoned Australian documentary maker Mr James Ricketson and has acted to all intents and purposes as a dictatorship. Not only is this a terrifying prospect for the Cambodian people themselves, but it is terrifying for the Australian Cambodian community. The fear and the oppression of dictatorship has followed them like a dark shadow and still casts its pall over the community here in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cambodian community in Adelaide have expressed to me their fear at the infiltration of CPP operatives and Hun Sen allies here in Australia, including in my hometown of Adelaide. Several community members have raised their concerns about the Cambodian Cultural Association, a body incorporated in March 2017. While people of all political persuasions are free to promote their views and celebrate their culture, it appears clear to me from community reports that the Cambodian Cultural Association is little more than a front for Hun Sen. They have no presence in any cultural events nor do they have a website, and their Facebook page, Cambodian Cultural South Australia, has had only five posts since January 2017. Instead, the group seems largely focused on the intimidation of the local Cambodian community. The leaders of the group are reportedly close allies of Hun Sen and regularly travel to and from Cambodia. Photographs posted to social media show them posing with guns, in Cambodian military garb and with CPP representatives, including members of Hun Sen's family. Further, relatives of Hun Sen have moved to the north of Adelaide and have hosted Hun Manet, the son of Hun Sen and a leader of the Cambodian military. Members of the community have also reported to me that membership of this organisation is garnered by bribery and threats against community members' families back in Cambodia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members of the community live in fear and are now afraid to visit their families in Cambodia, believing that these Hun Sen associates would inform on them and the CPP would arrest them or their families. These fears are well founded, especially considering Hun Sen's public and vociferous threats to protesters against his attendance at the recent ASEAN summit that he would 'follow them home'. I've spoken to many brave Cambodian Australians who took part in those protests and now fear what might happen to them if they visit friends and family back in Cambodia out of well-founded fears that the protests here in Australia were monitored by Hun Sen supporters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hun Sen has frozen democracy and obliterated due process in Cambodia. CNRP figures languish in Cambodian prisons, like Mr Kem Sokha, or live in exile, like Sam Rainsy and many other CNRP leaders and former MPs. Bou Rachana, the widow of assassinated political figure Kem Ley, was even granted asylum recently in Australia, because of the threat to her and her children's lives under Hun Sen's regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia must act to protect our stewardship of the peace accords and, importantly, we must also call out to protect our way of life here in Australia. Australians should feel safe, secure and free from intimidation, not still living under the thumb of a dictator.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  The 2018 budget is a blueprint for an Australia that takes intergenerational equity seriously. As Liberals, our vision is to maximise opportunity for every Australian: generation Y, generation Z and those generations yet to come. If you're young, this budget is designed to empower you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are seven pillars to this budget to benefit young Australians. First: investment in education, particularly in regional, rural and remote Australia. We've made it easier for students to access youth allowance, and there's an extra $50 million to reduce Centrelink call waiting times. We've also delivered record levels of funding for universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second: job creation. In this budget an extra $90 million will create more places in the Transition to Work program, which targets 15 to 21-year-olds who are at risk of long-term unemployment. There's also funding for the Brotherhood of St Laurence to set up a youth employment body. Youth unemployment is twice that of the general population, at 12½ per cent. The Turnbull government has now delivered more than one million jobs at 1,100 a day. The most recent ABS data shows strong support in full-time work. Many of these jobs are giving young Australians a first foothold on the ladder of opportunity or helping them to advance their careers. We want to turbocharge that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third: making superannuation simple. If you've had multiple part-time jobs, odds are that you've got multiple superannuation accounts sitting and being eaten up by admin fees in opt-out life insurance policies you never asked for. Under the government's changes to superannuation, the Australian Taxation Office will automatically consolidate funds worth less than $6,000. Not only does that remove a mountain of paperwork but it also boosts savings in the long run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth: income tax relief. More than 70 per cent of federal taxes come from income. The biggest growth in government expenditure is to support an ageing population—pensions, aged care, the PBS and health care at the most expensive stage of life. The Turnbull government's tax relief program will lower middle-income tax rates and start to address the wealth transfer from young workers to retirees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth: delivering a surplus and paying down the debt. High government debt has been incurred to fund services for established generations, to be repaid by their children and their grandchildren. Overspending today simply means higher taxes for young Australians tomorrow. All that government debt has pumped into the economy to stop adjustments; it's kept house prices high and stopped an adjustment that could have made housing more affordable. It's now time for young Australians to be unshackled to seek their own future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth is mental health. One in four young Australians experience a mental health condition, and the $92.4 million investment in frontline mental health services includes $33.8 million for Lifeline, $10.5 million for beyondblue and $2.2 million for Defence Force Reservists. That is on top of the $110 investment in youth mental health programs, a million dollars to help young people with mental illness to find jobs and $18 million for the establishment of The National Centre for Excellence in Youth Mental Health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventh: doing what Canberra can on housing affordability. Housing prices go down when there is ready supply. That's mostly up to the states and local councils, but the Turnbull government is doing everything it can. In last year's budget we changed the law to allow first homebuyers to contribute money tax-free into their super accounts. Without tax, you're saving faster. We've announced a $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility, especially designed to invest in transport, water and power to keep up the housing supply no matter where you are. And since 2015, the Commonwealth has also injected $722 million into the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, particularly focusing on youth homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, of course, there are craft breweries. As of this budget, the extra tax on craft beer is gone. This budget is designed specifically to deliver for young Australians so they can realise their opportunity and their best chance in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, with your indulgence, I would like to acknowledge somebody in the gallery. As you know, last year we had an incredible debate on peoples' lives and the recognition of their relationships. I would particularly like to acknowledge Jill Kindt, who is in the gallery, and her marriage to her wife, Jo Grant, who sadly passed away. They were the first same-sex couple to be married following the change in law that this House ratified with nearly unanimous support. I can't imagine what it has been like to deal with the tragedy of that loss, and all I can say, on behalf of the people of Australia, is that I'm sorry it took so long.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Today is National TAFE Day, so what better occasion to speak on the importance of education and training in light of this government's cuts to Australia's tertiary education sector. Every year, National TAFE Day gives us an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of our universally accessible and world-class vocational education system. A study commissioned in 2013 by the Allen Consulting Group found that for every dollar invested in TAFE an estimated $6.40 worth of benefit is returned to the Australian economy, so it's really disappointing that, on a day that should be celebrating the success of Australia's vocational education tradition, the theme of National TAFE Day is 'Stop TAFE Cuts' for the fifth year in a row.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a national shame that every single year this coalition government has been in power has seen cuts to TAFE, totalling more than $2.8 billion. Under the modelling by Allen Consulting Group, that's at least $18 billion in economic benefit that this government has chosen to forgo by failing to invest in vocational education. Those opposite on the government benches think the money is better used to fund a tax handout for millionaires and big business. That is breathtakingly short-sighted. With this government's raid on TAFE and vocational education funding, the total number of publicly supported students is at the lowest level in a decade. This is despite an increasing number of jobs requiring vocational skills. In too many cities and regional centres across Australia, TAFE campuses have closed, courses have been scaled back and fees have increased. Labor will fight cuts to TAFE and apprentices and ensure that we have a skills-and-training sector that prepares Australians for quality jobs today and into the future. We'll do this because it's a Labor value that every Australian deserves the opportunity to get a quality education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Labor's belief in the value of education isn't limited to TAFE. Under the last Labor government we removed the cap on university places and granted greater access to a university education for students across Australia, especially for students with lower socioeconomic status and students in the regions. In my electorate alone we saw 1,536 more locals make their way to university because of Labor. That's aspiration. But, because of the $2.2 billion cut from universities in the 2016-17 budget, which reversed Labor's policy and put a cap on student places, it's now estimated that around 10,000 people could miss out on a university place this year because of this government. We'll abolish the unfair cap on student places, and we'll also reverse the $22 billion that has been cut from Australian primary and secondary schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who watched question time today, Mr Speaker, will note how well you managed both sides of the House. But they will also note that there was a lot of discussion about aspiration and about which party provides so-called aspirational Australians with the greatest opportunities. I believe there is no more distinguishing indicator of this government's utter disregard for working and middle-class Australians than in their attitude towards education and their implementation of policies that cruel educational opportunities. This is a government whose Prime Minister believes that those struggling to make ends meet should 'aspire to get a better job' while also closing down opportunities for Australians to get an education or additional training. Good education and skills are crucial to improving a person's economic and social progress, and that's why Labor will take the vital step of restoring funding to TAFEs, universities and schools across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken in this place before about my parents instilling in me the critical importance of education to all of our futures. Education and the lasting impact of dedicated teachers have been of critical importance. I remember one of the catch-ups I had with one of my most famous predecessors in Wills and one of Australia's greatest Prime Ministers, Bob Hawke. I asked Bob if, with all the achievements of his administration, there was a policy that went unheralded. He told me that when he became PM in 1983 only one-third of students in Australia finished year 12 and that, through the policies his government put in place, by 1991 the completion rate had almost tripled to 90 per cent. Bob was particularly proud of that achievement, and it hit home for me, as it was the visionary policy achievements of Labor governments—the one he led and those before and after—that gave me and millions of other Australians access to a quality education. I am and will be forever grateful for that opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Millions of Australians, whatever their ethnic background, whatever their socioeconomic status, whatever their postcode, have been given opportunities through these Labor Party policies of fairness. For me and my family and my sister, access to education was life-changing. Education is the key that opened the door to opportunity, so that millions of us could work and contribute to this society. That Labor Party commitment to equality of opportunity is not just a three-word slogan; it means so much to millions of Australians, including my family. That's why we're so committed to education.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  A government that's growing the economy to make sure essential services continue is very important to each and every one of us. Australia is probably one of the best places to live as we age. With health services better than many other nations, we're sometimes quick to criticise some small difficulties that may arise and are slow to recognise that we still have one of the best systems in the world. Many developing nations are looking to Australia for training and care inspiration in the aged sector. We are truly world leaders. Societies in both developed and developing nations, like Japan and China, have historically had a firm family structure of support. But, as their economies changed, there's been a parallel change in the dynamics of support for their older citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite having leading policies and strategies to care for our ageing population, we have a system that is being stretched by demand. Our population has a demographic structure that shows that, while we have a statistical bulge for the baby boomers, we're likely to have even more pressure on the needs of appropriate aged care in the next few decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2017 we transitioned to a new home care system for older Australians to have more choice and control in their care. The demand for home care, especially for level 3 and level 4 packages, is increasing. There are four levels of care available and an individual is assessed to be eligible for one of these levels. We're investing an additional $1.6 billion in home care packages to allow 14,000 new high-level home care packages over four years. Many more older Australians with high-care needs will receive the support they require sooner and remain living at home for longer. The additional investment in high-care packages will also improve the wait times for home care, particularly for levels 3 and 4.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department works closely with the aged-care assessment teams across the regions to make sure there's a nationally consistent approach to these home care package approvals. Many people in the queue are already receiving support services through our record $5.5 billion investment in the Commonwealth Home Support Program, which assists around 800,000 older Australians. Approximately half of those on the waiting list are already receiving an interim package. So we really are addressing the queue system. Of the remaining people on the list, many are receiving some form of home care assistance, such as Meals on Wheels, gardening, cleaning or personal care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other community based programs that are available to all Australians include palliative care and Dementia Australia. In the 2018-19 budget the government announced an additional $32.8 million to increase access to community based palliative care to support older Australians who wish to pass away with the choice of dignity in their own home. We also committed an additional $5.3 million to improve care for people living with dementia, with an emphasis on the use of innovative technologies. Private services can always be purchased to help those who have a little more in their own savings to help them through. There's a misconception in the community that the changes introduced have meant less care and less consideration for our elderly. That is definitely not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my aged-care providers has presented me with some feedback and some potential solutions for consideration. This may include having a single person or case officer. Each time a new operator takes a call, providers and consumers need to restate a lot of detail, investing time and effort in building an understanding of the consumer's issues. Another suggestion is to have a file note issued to the caller, noting any agreement, action or escalation, and for this to include a reference to the operator either by name or number. If a consumer does not know their ID number or has not been provided a copy of their ACAT, their package cannot be activated. A suggestion was made that perhaps a card could be issued—something similar to a pension card. Perhaps a provider could simply quote a consumer or case number to the client and then the operator would confirm the details on file.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very often our older citizens can't always get onto the internet and they do need to be assisted. Sometimes a person moves from one provider to another for a variety of reasons, and the package and any unallocated funding will not transfer if the previous provider doesn't revoke the package in the system. There doesn't appear to be a mechanism to compel them to do so. Perhaps a compliance mechanism could be developed to ensure providers actually say, 'You need to move that package on to wherever the person actually is.' This should be done in a timely manner. These are just some of the suggestions that I'll take to the Minister for Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, on their behalf to see if we can talk to the providers about their very constructive suggestions for better aged care and changes to this system that can help make their lives have much better quality.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Tonight I want to acknowledge some very important people in the gallery. The Hon. Yvette D'Ath, the Attorney-General of Queensland and, of course, a former member of this place, is here, as is her staffer, Kirsten MacGregor, and, most importantly of all, Jill Kindt is here with her sister Robyn. Jill Kindt and her wife, Jo Grant, were together for a very long time. They had a commitment ceremony in 2013, which they saw as the beginning of their marriage. But they also had another ceremony in 2018, and that was a legal wedding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jo was terminally ill with a rare cancer on the day of that wedding, 15 December last year. She passed away very soon after. But the two of them really considered themselves to be married since their commitment ceremony. That was their real wedding and their real marriage. But it is important to note that theirs was Australia's first legal wedding to be held under the marriage equality laws that this parliament passed on 7 December, just over a week before. When they married, they didn't wish their story to be told, but now Jill, along with her mother-in-law, Sandra, are happy for the world to know. The Queensland Attorney-General, the Hon. Yvette D'Ath, has told their story in the Queensland parliament. Tonight, I acknowledge it in the nation's parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had a chance to talk to Jill tonight, and so has the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Jill told us that, when the postal survey results came back, she and Jo really felt relief rather than happiness. But, as they saw how happy their friends and family were, they became happy too. When marriage equality finally passed, Jill told me that organising to get legally married felt impossible for her. Jo was very ill, receiving palliative care from a local group called Cittamani. Jill was there around the clock, of course, as Jo's carer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jill had a conversation with Loretta, one of the palliative care nurses about how out of reach marriage seemed. Loretta, showing the great kindness so typical of those who work in palliative care, took immediate steps to find out whether a wedding could be organised. She spoke with another nurse, Leanne, and that set in train some conversations with the registry of births, deaths and marriages in Yvette's department. The usual 30-day waiting period was waived because of Jo's cancer. They had had a real scare earlier in the year, in March. There was no time to waste. It was less than two months after the wedding that Jo passed away. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jill, congratulations on your wedding. Thank you for coming all the way to Canberra to parliament to talk to us about your love story and about your wife. I'm so sorry for your loss. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jill and Jo were married in Queensland with the help of the wonderful staff at births, deaths and marriages—because of their work, the paperwork difficulties, the waiting period and the other hurdles were overcome. Jo and Jill were approved, married and registered all in one day thanks to their work. Tracy Rankin from births, deaths and marriages even drove halfway to Coolum, where the ceremony was held, so she could hand over the marriage certificates to the celebrant, Kari, who had also been arranged by the palliative care nurses. They did it at a roadside servo. It was so soon after the bill passed that the births, deaths and marriages people hadn't even designed a commemorative certificate yet, so they whipped up two versions in 24 hours and printed both so that Jill and Jo could choose. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jill told me that, at the wedding ceremony, Jo talked a lot about community, and they were really just so grateful for the community pulling together, and for these people they hadn't even met before—they didn't even know them, strangers—working so hard to make their wedding possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the photos tonight from the first ceremony back in 2013, from the ceremony that was held in December 2015. Tanya and I were in tears. The photos were amazing. They were beautiful. Jill's wife was such a special person. Jill told us about the jewellery that she made and the sculptures that she made and the craft that she put together and the things that she could do and how driven she was. It was really humbling to hear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This beautiful, sad story is a reminder of the importance of removing discrimination. Jill told me that that was what mattered to her and to Jo, to have the same rights as anyone else. Before their marriage, Jill had been removed as Jo's next of kin on two occasions. She had to explain their relationship. How hard would that be when you're caring for someone you love who's about to pass away, to have to justify your relationship? This love story shames this parliament for failing to pass marriage equality sooner, because it's almost impossible not to think of others who didn't survive to marry legally. Most of all, it affirms this parliament's decision from last year. It's great to see that there have been 564 same-sex marriages registered in Queensland alone since that decision. It's a love story and I congratulate them. Jill, I'm sorry for your loss.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  It has been increasingly brought to my attention throughout the electorate of Murray by a wide range of businesses that businesses are having difficulty sourcing the skilled workers that they need. This is restricting their businesses in sustaining their current levels of production and also their opportunities to move forward. Many businesses have expressed this inability to take on additional work because they simply have a lack of the skilled and unskilled workers that they need. This is stopping them from attaining further contracts to take their business into another sphere. With our current buoyant economic conditions, this shortage of skilled workers is also retarding the ability of these businesses to grow into different spheres—not just in the exact same areas that they are currently operating within.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Tuesday, I had the opportunity of hosting the Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation, Craig Laundy. During the minister's visit, we brought a range of business owners and CEOs together for a roundtable meeting with the minister. Around the table we had engineers, primary producers, meat processors, mechanics and hospitality and aged-care providers represented, and they told the minister of their daily battle to try to find the right labour. The common topic for all of these businesses was how difficult it is to source the labour that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One car dealership proprietor in Shepparton who employs 33 staff and four apprentices told me that, due to his skills shortages, the only way that he can get through his daily business is to try to recruit staff from overseas, and the overseas workers that he has are very highly regarded both within the business and by the customers. This business owner pointed out that the Motor Trades Association of Australia completed an exhaustive survey in August 2017. This survey found that Australia needed an additional 16,000 motor mechanics and at least 2,500 diesel mechanics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also had the example of Shepparton Retirement Villages, the largest regional aged-care provider in Victoria, which employs just over 400 staff. They care for over 700 elderly patients at any one given time over six different residential care facilities and 271 independent living units, and they're all located in greater Shepparton. They struggle to find aged-care workers because it is not seen as an attractive option when compared to nursing or to medicine. They also have trouble with the institutions that are preparing to train these people in aged care. These institutions are trying to get them job ready, making sure that the carers are fully qualified and that they've spent enough time in clinical placements so that they have enough experience. The industry is telling me that it's very difficult to attract workers into the aged-care sector, and that is something that we need to be up-front about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also had an amount of businesses that cannot find welders, fitters and turners and metalworkers. This is not just a matter of not being able to find fruit pickers or dairy hands anymore; this is not just a matter of agriculture. Some of those dirty jobs working in the abattoirs—that shortage has been around for 10 to 15 years, and we've had to get others from outside of Australia to come and do this dirty work. That's what we're finding now, even in a large regional city like Shepparton, and I also find this in many other large regional cities, as to many of the jobs. But the motor mechanic that I recently visited has perfect weather control so that they don't experience the heat or the cold; the temperature is controlled throughout the garage. It's like a laboratory, clear of any grease and oil; most of the members are in fact more like laboratory workers. So we need to put some balance into this issue, we need to take away the politics of this issue and we need to make it as easy as we can. If these people cannot find Australians to work in these areas, we need to make it easier to find people from overseas to take these jobs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Today is National TAFE Day, and I rise to condemn the Turnbull government's abject failure as the steward of Australia's skills and training network. The Liberals have demonstrated again and again how little they understand what Australia really needs in order to compete in the 21st century knowledge economy. TAFE should be the backbone of our skills and training network, but under the Liberal government it has been denigrated, attacked and near on destroyed. Make no mistake, this system is in crisis. Year after year, budget after budget, the Liberals have levied vicious cuts that have brought this critical national training institution to its knees. Their contempt is conspicuous, their derision undeniable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Liberals came to power, $3 billion has been ripped out of the sector, with Commonwealth funding for training at TAFE dropping by over a third. And then, when TAFE was at its lowest point in decades, the Turnbull government got another kick in by ripping a further $270 million out of skills and training in this year's budget to help fund its $80 billion tax breaks to big business, multinationals and the banks. This isn't about cost savings or efficiencies. This is a war on public education, and our former world-class training system is the casualty. In my electorate of Newcastle we have already lost more than a third of our apprentices and trainees since the Liberals came to office in 2013. Across New South Wales we've lost 175,000 students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one sure-fire way to ensure that TAFE will live on, and that is to vote this government out at the next election. Labor gets the importance of TAFE, and a Shorten Labor government will restore it to the centre of our national vocational training system by guaranteeing that at least two-thirds of government funding for VET goes to TAFE. We will restore the $600 million the government ripped out of TAFE in the 2017 budget; we will invest $100 million, revitalising regional and outer metro campuses across the country; and we will waive up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But until we have a Labor government we must unite against the Turnbull government's ongoing cuts. That's why I have launched a local campaign and established a petition—which is at my website, www.sharonclaydon.com—to demand that Mr Turnbull stop his vicious attacks on our skills and training system. Please join me in telling the Prime Minister that we won't sit back and watch quietly while his government tears our TAFE apart.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  It was early on a relatively cold Queensland Saturday morning earlier this month when I attended with many thousands of others the start-line proceedings for the Kokoda Challenge endurance event in Brisbane. Courage, mateship, endurance and sacrifice: these words provide the core values of the Kokoda Youth Foundation, which is inspiring young Australians, particularly those who are disadvantaged, and providing opportunities for them to reach their full potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doug Henderson OAM, the association's founder and a Vietnam veteran, was motivated to start the foundation after listening to a guest speaker talk about the Battle of the Kokoda Track at an RSL conference. Doug wanted to keep the Kokoda spirit alive and believed this could be done by incorporating Kokoda values into life-changing experiences for young Australians. Now, more than 10 years on, one single youth program and event has turned into a wide range of youth programs, events and camps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the focus is on youth programs, a significant part of the foundation's funding comes from the Kokoda Challenge, a series of 15-, 30- and 96-kilometre walks throughout Queensland and Victoria. The Brisbane challenge is held annually at Brookfield in my electorate, and I was very proud to send off more than 2,000 competitors, including 316 school teams. There to cheer on participants was a crowd of almost 2,500 people. The challenge began early on a Saturday morning, with competitors completing a 15-, 30- or 48-kilometre walk through the hills of Ryan, some of Brisbane's toughest terrain. The Kokoda Youth Foundation's programs provide significant support and opportunities for young Australians. The Kokoda Challenge Youth Program takes place over 12 months, with six months of physical training and mentoring and six months of community service. The longer time frame teaches youth to commit to the challenge and in doing so, they learn responsibility and reliability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundation is contributing to our local communities, with money raised by these events going straight back into programs to help young people in the area. These include adventure based learning, community service and a funded trip to Papua New Guinea to hike the real Kokoda Track. This means at-risk youth can challenge their limits and abilities, and it provides them with opportunities for personal growth. The foundation not only offers many opportunities for our youth but also supports those who supported us all those years ago: the people of Papua New Guinea. Each year the foundation recognises the role and vital contribution made by the people of Papua New Guinea during the battles of Kokoda, by donating money and resources to communities and villages along the track. These resources go towards improving local schools and hospitals, medical teams, and building and maintenance teams. Many thanks must go to Doug Henderson and his wife, Anna, and foundation staff members including Naomi, Kate, Dan and James. Without their assistance, this challenge would indeed be a challenge.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Australia has good relations with Vietnam, and we have a particularly fond affection for the Vietnamese-Australian community. Today the Human Rights Subcommittee of the foreign affairs committee heard from VOICE, a local and international organisation that supports human rights in Vietnam; things we take for granted here in Australia—freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly—that are denied people in Vietnam, where there is harassment of human rights defenders such as the heroic Minh Anh, who is here from Vietnam visiting the parliament and is sitting in the public gallery today. The committee and the parliament must take up the issues of Tran Huynh Duy Thuc, the entrepreneur who has been arrested; Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, aka Me Nam, the blogger who was convicted; and Hoang Duc Binh, the environmental and labour rights activist. We should use the new strategic partnership and TPP negotiations with Vietnam to leverage our rules-based order, referred to in the joint statement, to promote the rule of law including the observance and implementation of international legal obligations in good faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vietnam's new cybersecurity law has been found to have violated certain provisions of the comprehensive and progressive agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that Minister Tran Tuan Anh signed with Steven Ciobo on 8 March 2018, and there have been demonstrations all over Vietnam about that in recent days. DFAT should support local human-rights defenders, like Minh Anh and many others, by meeting them regularly and working with other embassies in Hanoi to ensure that the authorities' travel ban against them is lifted, and arbitrary arrests and assaults against human-rights offenders are promptly reported. We should request an update on DFAT's specific support including financial support for registered and unregistered civil organisations, and how they contribute to the development of independent civil society in Vietnam. Australia should do as other countries do, and support NGOs that are not registered by the Vietnamese government—because registered organisations are used to perpetuate the current system, unlike unregistered civil society organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all, we should support the passing of a global Magnitsky act in Australia to punish individuals and entities committing gross violations of human rights, and to use as a deterrent in the future. I warn the Vietnamese government that, if it continues to persecute people in Vietnam, this legislation, a global Magnitsky act, is more likely to be passed here in Australia because of its violations of human rights in Vietnam. A global Magnitsky act would see Vietnamese officials not so easily able to come to Australia—not to travel to Australia, not to invest their funds in Australia, and not to send their children to be educated in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  There are times when all of us in this chamber are very proud to be Australian. The reason for that is there are Australians doing great work around the world. I want to talk about one of those groups who are doing great things. The Swahili word 'rafiki' means 'friend'. On 9 June my wife, Cheryle, and I attended the 2018 Rafiki Ball at Crown Perth in my electorate of Swan. It was a fantastic evening with over 550 people attending. Now in its 15th year, the Rafiki Ball is the main fundraising event for the Rafiki Surgical Missions. This is an organisation that has changed the lives of thousands of Tanzanian children and adults with conditions such as cleft lip, cleft palate and burns injuries. Each year, the ball assists in fundraising the majority of the mission's operating costs to send medical teams across to Tanzania to provide free medical treatment and train local staff. It also assists in funding the transport of donated medical equipment to under-resourced clinics and hospitals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rafiki is a volunteer organisation, and every dollar raised at the ball goes directly to its work in Tanzania. Australian-born children with disfiguring facial deformities have them repaired while they are still babies, but this does not happen for babies in Tanzania. In Tanzania's remote rural areas, sufferers can be forced to endure a lifetime of marginalisation. Rafiki's volunteer surgical teams are giving these people the chance to live normal lives. Treated babies will grow up never knowing the alienation that they may have been subjected to. Children go back to school with new confidence and completely accepted by their peers, and adults go on to find work, marry and even take on important leadership roles in their villages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rafiki teams have undertaken 29 surgical missions in Mwanza and Dar es Salaam. Volunteer surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses perform up to 80 operations during each two-week mission, and physiotherapists work with patients postoperatively. Local doctors and nurses also benefit from our collaboration with host hospitals, working alongside our medical team, building their own skills in this specialised area of reconstructive surgery. In addition to the services and training, Rafiki also sends medical treatments to Tanzania that would otherwise go to waste in Australia. Since 2010 Rafiki has packed and shipped more than 43 containers for distribution to hospitals and medical centres in Tanzania. The replacement cost of this equipment exceeds $10 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Australia Tanzania Society, with the help of Rafiki, sent two containers to Tanzania and distributed medical equipment, school equipment and laptop computers across the country. ATS also facilitated some volunteers to teach in primary school and donated a school bus to the community. These are Australians that we can be extremely proud of. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Since the beginning of this year my office in Shortland has received over 100 calls about NDIS failures under this government. The people in my electorate are fed up with being constantly denied information and waiting in endless queues for care they are entitled to receive. This government has turned the philosophy of the NDIS from 'choice and control' to 'reasonable and necessary'. The NDIS was meant to give agency back to Australians with disabilities, the chance to choose, when it came to their care. Instead, in its bungled rollout of this scheme, this government has left people feeling hopeless rather than empowered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Mr Carlos Morrow, for example, a bilateral amputee who has recently undergone self-funded surgery at a personal cost of over $35,000. Mr Morrow underwent this procedure because he wanted to keep working and contributing to society. But the prosthetic leg and wheelchair he needs from the NDIS are nowhere to be seen. He's been trying to get a new leg for over two years and it's nowhere in sight. These issues should be taken seriously by the NDIA and they should be clear to recipients about the status of their claims. Unfortunately, people who ask about them are greeted with the same answer. They are told: 'Under section 100 of the NDIS Act 2013 there is no legislated time frame to make an internal review decision. However, this agency will endeavour to make a decision as soon as it is operationally practicable.' There is no accountability or transparency and, as a result, I and many of my Labor colleagues deal with individual claims daily. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the government got up in question time and sought to lecture us about aspiration. That must sound a bit rich to people like Carlos Morrow. The message from this government is clear: aspiring to make more money for the big four banks is fantastic, but if your aspiration is simply to have choice and control over your own life they can't help you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the NDIS is a fantastic concept that every single member of parliament supports, but problems have been rife in its implementation. We've seen issues around plans. If you're a great advocate or you've got a great advocate working with you, you can get a plan that suits your life and gives you some control over your life, but if you don't have that, if you come from a less privileged background or have less information, you are faced with a cookie-cutter approach. Even if you get the plan that you want, the plans are subject to annual reviews that change it, and the process of reviewing those plans is incredibly problematic and complicated. I know of one constituent who had to put in a 27-page rebuttal to the review of their family member's plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're serious about the NDIS empowering the lives of so many Australians with a disability, we must get it right. We must give them clear choices, and we must empower them rather than get them mired in endless bureaucracy that disempowers them and reduces the quality of their life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  I want to update the house on how this government is investing in the future of farmers, whilst at the same time protecting our environment. Through our world-leading initiatives to reduce Australia's carbon footprint, the government will injects millions of dollars into our agricultural industry. In particular, I'd like to note the significant contribution to my home state of Western Australia through new contracts awarded for carbon abatement. I'm very pleased to say that a number of these projects will be based in my electorate, and I know my constituents will welcome the investment in their local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the Clean Energy Regulator awarded 32 contracts, worth a combined $90 million, to secure new carbon abatement projects. These projects will deliver some 6.7 million tonnes of abatement, which sets the average cost per tonne at roughly $13. This funding allows these successful farmers to use their often degraded land for other commercial purposes. This is a responsible and extremely low cost form of reducing emissions, and it also creates jobs. It is for this reason that I welcome this major investment in regional Western Australia through the latest ERF auction. Of the 32 projects I mentioned, 15 will be based in Western Australia. Those projects are worth a combined $47.5 million, more than half of the total funding allocated in the most recent auction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to briefly touch on some of those initiatives we're funding because, aside from the obvious benefit to the environment, they're actually going to be real game changers for parts of regional Western Australia. In the Shire of Sandstone, the Atley Station Regeneration Project will establish permanent native forests on land that was previously cleared of vegetation. We're backing more than a dozen projects that will deliver similar outcomes in rural WA, including the Goldfields and other parts of the mid-west. In Boddington, which is in the southern region of WA, the government will invest in a project that sequesters carbon by establishing and maintaining a new plantation forest. This plantation will continue to boost the state's economy in years to come through the commercial harvesting of wood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This outlines the Turnbull government's pragmatic approach to managing our environmental footprint. As I've said, we're offsetting a significant amount of carbon through these latest projects, and in situations where often there is no valuable use for the land. So it's a very good story. But, more importantly, we're investing in communities; we're stimulating those parts of the economy where, let's face it, not a lot is happening on that degraded land; and we're also creating jobs. As the Assistant Minister for the Environment I very much look forward to seeing the success of these projects in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  In the last few weeks, we've seen some statistics and data about airports in Australia, particularly about flights being on time at airports. Many people in this place would know that Hobart Airport is located on the edge of my electorate and the member for Lyons' electorate, and we're pretty concerned. Thanks to the investments of the former state and federal Labor governments, we've had a significant increase in tourism in Tasmania. At the moment, we've got this wonderful festival on called Dark Mofo, and people are coming in their thousands from all over the country to celebrate the winter solstice in Hobart. But, unfortunately, so many flights coming in and out of Hobart Airport are not on time or are cancelled, and it's causing big problems. It's causing problems for those Tasmanians who are missing work, missing meetings, missing weddings and missing family get-togethers. Importantly, it is also causing problems for tourists who want to come to Tasmania and then need to get back to their work and family commitments. In April, 74.8 per cent of flights were on time, which shows that almost one in four of the flights out of Hobart are actually delayed regularly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the government data showed that Hobart was the second in the nation in terms of worst performance in delays. Whilst we are, obviously, south of most of the other ports in Australia when it comes to airports, it's not good enough for the airlines to continue to allow this to happen. I call on those airlines that operate in and out of Tasmania—Jetstar, Virgin, Tiger, Qantas and QantasLink—to look at what they can do to support those Tasmanians and other Australians that want to continue to visit Hobart and Tasmania. As I've said, we've had a booming industry in tourism over the last decade or so. We've really invested in our products in Tasmania. We've got some great natural attractions and, of course, as I said, the great festivals. Tourism contributes significantly to the Tasmanian economy—around $2½ billion to gross state product, which is nearly 10 per cent of our gross state product. It's very significant. Indeed, it's the highest proportion of gross state product related to tourism in the country. Of course, tourism also supports a lot of jobs in our state, so we need these operators of the airlines to consider really seriously what they can do to ensure that flights in and out of Hobart for Tasmanians and for mainlanders that want to come down and visit are on time. They need to do more. It's not good enough to continually have these excuses. Money has been invested by Hobart Airport corp to get the airport up to scratch, because there are some significant issues. They underestimated the number of passengers coming through that airport. They're now planning further upgrades to try and deal with this, but, of course, the airlines also have a big role to play, and I call on them to try and fix this. It's not good enough for Tasmanians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I rise today to mark the passing of Alfred John Mitchell OAM, BEM, a giant of the Dickson community. Alfred, better known as Jack, was born in 1922 in Camp Mountain. Jack passed away on 21 May, aged 96, after a very long and eventful life making our country and our community a much better place. He was a loving husband to his late wife, Joyce, and a doting father to his children, Ron and Kathy. He was a very proud grandfather and great-grandfather. Jack was a Samford man through and through. Like so many local children over the last century and a half, he attended the historic Samford State School. An industrious young man, by the age of 16 Jack was studying entomology and working on the banana plantations. When war came, Jack enlisted to defend his country. In 1942, at age 19, he joined the 7th Pioneers Unit of the Second Australian Imperial Force. He saw heavy fighting and served behind enemy lines, along Papua New Guinea's Wau-Salamaua Track in 1943. Even in war, his love of insects never waned, and he was known to ensnare PNG's exotic tropical butterflies in bamboo nets. Jack suffered from bouts of malaria and was severely wounded in his arm. He was discharged on medical grounds in October 1944, having served valiantly in the 2/17th Battalion of the 17th Brigade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was during the war that Jack came to develop a strong sense of community and a deep appreciation of the value of teamwork. Shortly after the end of the war, Jack, along with others, formed the Samford RSL. This was a significant achievement, but it is important to note that Jack's community service was not limited to supporting veterans. He formed the Camp Mountain firefighters in 1948 and, in 1951, successfully lobbied the government to form the rural fire brigade. He went on to create the Samford progress and protection association, and it was on the association's initiative that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Village Pump </span>first went to print in 1977 and that the Samford museum would open in 1986.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jack was a passionate naturalist and conservationist. His reverence for the bush saw him establish a rainforest nursery and led him to work with rural landholders and councils on revegetation projects. All through Jack's life, he strongly believed in giving back to his community. A deep appreciation of the value of community service and volunteering formed the basis of his world view. Jack may have passed, but his legacy will live on in the community he so enriched. His life was one well lived, and each of us can learn a great deal from Jack's life and his example. My condolences to Ron, Kathy, their families and his many mates throughout the local community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I am privileged to work with many worthwhile causes in our community—and there are many of them in our community. However, this afternoon I'd like to make special mention of one in particular, being YMCA Brisbane and their Red Poppy Project. As members of this House would be aware, 2018 marks the 100th year since the Armistice that ended World War I, where 61,530 Australians and millions more lost their lives. This year also marks 100 years since the YMCA introduced the wearing of the red poppy as a symbol of remembrance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To honour those who made the ultimate sacrifice, YMCA Brisbane are undertaking the Red Poppy Project, by handmaking 80,000 poppies to display at YMCA Bowen Hills on Remembrance Day—one for every Australian and New Zealander killed in World War I. As part of the display, a special wall will be dedicated to the 394 YMCA representatives who served with the YMCA during the First World War. These men volunteered to work in war-torn countries without pay, without title, without recognition as a military force and without weapons. The project is being led by YMCA Group Services Manager Meg Woolf, alongside many other hardworking and dedicated volunteers like local Oxley resident John Westwood, from Mount Ommaney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The poppies will be handmade across 62 YMCA Brisbane sites, alongside YMCA's gyms, childcare centres, youth activities, camping events and community programs. Interest has grown and now includes Girl Guide groups, fitness members, youth justice centres, men's sheds, children, women's groups, nursing homes, social clubs, retirement groups, state schools and accountancy firms. YMCA staff and their families have also pledged their support to the project and are busy undertaking this significant task. Most poppies are being carefully made out of paper. However, some beautiful crocheted and knitted poppies have already been received by the YMCA from community groups. This includes a waterfall of poppies in the stairwell of the YMCA head office, a garden of stem poppies, a wreath made of patty cake liners made by five-year-old children from a YMCA childcare centre, felt button poppies and a hanging garden of paper and fabric poppies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the coming months, the YMCA will be hosting craft nights and working bees at a number of centres, and local residents are encouraged to take a poppy-making kit home. Working bees have been held as far away as Mount Isa and Moranbah, with interested community members willingly cutting, stemming, drilling, gluing, crocheting or knitting a variety of red poppies. I acknowledge the numerous men's sheds who've also pledged their support to the project by making and painting the display stands. Residents are invited to attend the Bowen Hills site to watch as the YMCA gradually create this large visual display of handmade poppies as a community commemoration. I extend my congratulations to the YMCA and wish them all the very best for this important project to recognise our fallen heroes from the First World War.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I'm delighted to inform the House about a local business success story in my community on the Gold Coast. Craig International Ballistics, from Arundel, was one of 37 Australian businesses selected to be part of Team Defence Australia. Team Defence Australia travelled to Paris last week to showcase their products and capabilities amongst the world's best in the global defence industry, at the Eurosatory 2018 trade show. Craig International Ballistics is one of Australia's leading providers of lightweight, combat-proven body-armour systems for military and police personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence Team Australia and Craig International Ballistics have a key role in the implementation of the government's Defence Export Strategy. They're facilitating networking and engagement opportunities at the international trade show and ensuring access to global supply chains. This year's event had over 1,800 exhibitors, from 63 countries; 57,000 international visitors, from 153 countries; 227 official delegations, from 94 countries and four international organisations; and a staggering 641 journos. Exporting overseas will encourage growth, innovation and employment in my community and in other communities, and the work of Team Defence Australia and international events like this is to be commended. I look forward to seeing more of our local businesses taking advantage of these exciting opportunities to access defence export markets. Once again, congratulations to Craig International Ballistics and Team Defence Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the subject of defence, I'm delighted to be able to inform the House that we've been able to help out, in some innovative ways, one of my constituents, Mr Louis Smit, an Anzac veteran who served in World War II. Mr Smit is 97. He proudly lives at home in a lovely apartment, and he's only able to live at home because of the invaluable support of his carer, Mrs Santiago, an American national. Mr Smit's carer was facing deportation from Australia because she didn't meet the requirement for a carer's visa in that she wasn't a relative. However, I believed there were some compelling facts about this particular case, and I was backed up strongly by the minister. Mr Smit's daughter, who lives in the United States, and Ms Santiago have been best friends for 30 years. When Mr Smit's wife passed away in 2014, the Smit family, who could not leave the United States for work reasons, asked their long-time family friend to travel to Australia to care for Mr Smit, and Ms Santiago agreed. Her expenses are privately paid by the family and, as reported, it makes sense that Mr Smit is able to be independent at home without drawing on the taxpayer and is being cared for by a long-term family friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm delighted to report the department has reviewed the case and allowed World War II veteran Mr Smit's carer, Ms Santiago, to stay in Australia to care for him, as per the wishes of the family, wishes that go back decades and decades. And she will return to America the day this great veteran sadly departs. Well done to the family.</span>

                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  It's a great privilege and honour to speak at the table today, alongside my friends and colleagues the Minister for Aged Care and the member for Swan, the reason being that, together, they helped build and craft the case for a new Curtin University medical school and medical centre. I was privileged to be able to join the member for Swan there, and also to represent the Minister for Aged Care, when we met the incoming class of students. These new graduates will go through the system. They will be out and about in WA and they will be assisting patients right across Western Australia. That's practical action. That's an exemplar of what we're seeking to do with this health budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the health and aged care budget, outlined by the Treasurer on budget night, comprises $99 billion, $102 billion, $104 billion and $109 billion a year, each year, every year—record funding. But it's built across a very simple conceptual model of four pillars: support for our primary carers, our doctors, our nurses and those working with medicines; support for our hospitals; support for mental and preventative health; and support for medical research, alongside record funding in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of Medicare, we see overall funding go from $25 billion to $26 billion to $27 billion to $29 billion. But, perhaps most significantly, new and additional services are being provided in areas such as cystic fibrosis screening, 3D mammography for women and renal dialysis in remote Indigenous Australian areas. We are seeing prostate cancer support for men. So there's practical action right across the country. And it's coupled with record investment in terms of our medicines. In particular, we were able to list new medicines, such as SPINRAZA for spinal muscular atrophy and $700 million for Kisqali for breast cancer. These are incredibly important developments. Long-term funding, included in that medicines funding, with a billion-dollar contingency, is replacing that which was stripped out in 2010 and which left a subsequent hole in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In hospitals, what we see is a $30 billion addition over the course of the next hospital funding agreement—each year, every year, a record right across every state and every territory. It's an incredible outcome. We've already secured agreements with six of the states and territories, so we will be able to deliver what nobody has ever done before. That will include a doubling of hospital funding from when Labor was last in government to the end of the course of this agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also see is that we are making profound changes in private health insurance. It was a shame to see Labor join with the Greens to take steps today which may delay some of those changes. I'm hopeful that we'll still be able to achieve them on time. In particular, the prospect that discounts for young people could be delayed is something that I'd ask the ALP to quietly reflect on as they consider the next steps forward. There is the lowest change in private health premiums in 17 years—a considerable amount lower than every year under the ALP. But there is more to be done. At the end of the day, the hospital system will only work if it is strengthened by strong private health insurance, not weakened by an attack which would drive up out-of-pocket costs, drive down coverage and put at risk small health funds in states such as Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also see is record funding, with an additional $338 million for mental health—a passion of every member of this parliament, I say with confidence—and the $1.3 billion National Health and Medical Industry Growth Plan. That will deliver almost $250 million for rare cancer and rare disease clinical trials; $240 million for frontier science; and, through the Medical Research Future Fund, $500 million for the National Genomics Health Futures Mission over the next decade, which will change and transform treatment, diagnosis and prospects for Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  We heard a lot prior to the budget about how this budget was going to be a great thing for older Australians and how wonderful it would be for those requiring access to the aged-care system. We heard all this rhetoric again on budget night in the Treasurer's speech. But the reality is, as we now know, something quite different: there is not one new extra dollar for aged care over the forward estimates than there was already going to be in the forward estimates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard a lot about how the government was going to respond to the growing waiting list for home care packages. According to the government's own website, as at December last year over 100,000 Australians are waiting for a home care package so that they can get the services that they have been approved for and assessed for in their own home. They are waiting for level 3 and 4 packages for over 12 months, according to the government's own website. We know that; it's on the government website. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, the government claimed that it was funding 20,000 new home care packages. The reality is there are only 14,000 new packages in the budget over four years. That averages out at 3½ thousand new packages a year. That is, of course, not going to keep up with demand. As I've said many times in this place, the home care package waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of last year—20,000 in six months. So 14,000 new packages over four years is hardly going to cut it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Health, who's here—and I would be interested in his views—actually went on Sky News post budget and said, 'It will be the status quo for a short period of time, and then we'll start to look at a range of other interventions that will reduce that list.' So I'd be pleased to hear from the minister exactly what other interventions he has and how they are going to reduce that list, because I'm sure that he is, like I am, getting many of the thousands of calls from around the country to electorate offices, to people's offices, asking for support for people who are currently waiting at home for home care packages who can't get them. I'm getting calls from the desperate children of older parents, saying, 'I need to get my mum,'—or dad—'a home care package; we're sick of cobbling together the support.' I know the minister is getting them; we're all getting them. I'm getting so much feedback from people saying this is a growing problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government actually has the data for the March quarter. Indeed, in estimates, the department officials weren't really sure and wouldn't put on the record whether or not that data was already in the minister's office. Bearing in mind that estimates were some time ago and the government made a commitment that the quarterly data would be released two months after every quarter, that data is now significantly overdue—significantly overdue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister should come clean today, while he is here, about where that data is. What is the number of older Australians waiting for a home care package today? How many older Australians are currently sitting waiting for their packages at each level—level 1, level 2, level 3 and level 4 packages? We know the number continues to grow. It's not okay to sit on the data. The government should be up-front and honest with older Australians about how long it's going to take for those older Australians to get their package. It says on the website that it's going to take more than a year. What exactly does that mean? I'm getting instances still of some people who have been waiting much, much longer than a year for their package. It's not okay. We know what happens to these people: family members have to fill the void; they end up in emergency departments; and they end up in residential care when the don't want to go or before they want to go. It's just not good enough, Minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that you care about this, so would you explain to the chamber exactly what you are going to do. How is the government going to fix this? It knew that this waiting list would happen. It knew that it would continue to grow. It said it would address it in the budget, and it clearly has not. It has not done anywhere near enough for older Australians, their carers and their loved ones. It is playing a cruel hoax on older Australians, trying to pretend that, somehow, this budget is going to provide care faster for them, when we know that the response is completely inadequate, that those older Australians are going to continue to wait for considerable periods of time and that the government is not planning any further investment when it comes to home care packages. Those older Australians, their loved ones and their carers deserve much better than what they got in this budget. The minister should respond to my questions.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Let me say thank you, Minister, for the attention you gave the aged-care industry in the budget. You visited my electorate of Grey in the last six months. You accompanied me out to Ceduna, where we visited the aged-care facilities, and to Peterborough, where we have a few issues it must be said. We have talked extensively about the issues that they face and the difficulties of delivering comparable aged care in a regional setting, in a country delivery, because of the increased costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest increased costs and the biggest impediment to delivering aged care in the country is the supply of skilled staff. Small units in particular are having to resort to the use of agency care, which is very, very expensive. We know the ideal size for an aged-care facility is a minimum of around 65 or 70 beds. In South Australia, in particular, we have smaller towns which are interspersed by large distances. That is not the status quo. We need the aged-care facilities in these small communities, and we need ways of recognising the fact that it's more difficult to provide that service in those communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a long history of working on hospital boards in South Australia before I came to this place. Many of the small towns built hostels. In our wisdom, the hospital boards and the hostel boards amalgamated in the seventies and eighties. It seemed a sensible thing to do, and it was. Then of course in the 2000s the Labor government in South Australia came along and got rid of the hospital boards, and in doing so they inherited a swag of small aged-care units that they had no particular interest in, because those are not their prime responsibility. Yet they have an investment that needs to be renewed, replenished and built upon. A number of those units are facing tough times. Peterborough is one of them. Peterborough, to remind you, Minister, is a standalone hostel now used for high-level care, and the facility, while functional, needs upgrading and expanding. It also needs shifting to connect to the hospital, for obvious reasons, which is basically a new rebuild alongside the hospital. There, there is mutual support, which strengthens both agencies. The community has some significant savings but needs help. Unfortunately, the centre is operated by Country Health SA, which presents the circumstances of the difficulty of the Commonwealth investing in what is a state-run facility. I know you've turned your mind to this, and I'm hoping we can find a way forward in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To move on and discuss these issues further, I am part of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, which studied regionalisation and decentralisation around Australia. I asked Eldercare to come to Murray Bridge, when they were in South Australia, because I'd had a number of conversations with them. Eldercare operates a thousand aged-care beds across South Australia at 13 sites, three of which are in the country, on Yorke Peninsula, which is in my electorate. Their annual revenue is just under $100 million. In 2016-17 they had a net surplus of $1.4 million, so they're certainly not making a fortune—less than two per cent—but they are still viable and have very good assets. Of their three sites on Yorke Peninsula, one is at Maitland and is called The Village. There are 60 residential care beds and 17 retirement living units. The second facility is in Minlaton and is called South Park. It has 18 residential care beds, so it's a very small site. The third site is Elanora, at Stansbury, with 44 residential care beds and four retirement living units. They also run an aged-care home program across southern Yorke Peninsula, and the sites are responsible for day-to-day management. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eldercare have had great difficulty in recruiting senior staff, particularly to the Stansbury site, and it's completely blowing their budget. In fact, this year they're on track to make an EBIT, earnings before interest and tax, of negative $380,000 from that site, which has over 40 places. That's a net loss of $9,000 or more per bed. The average care cost as a percentage of the ACFI at Stansbury is 112 per cent. Clearly, if not for Eldercare's city facilities, their country sites might well be gone already. So my question is, Minister: what is the government doing to ensure country sites like Peterborough and Eldercare's Yorke Peninsula can not only survive but also expand to meet the anticipated increase in demand? </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Health. I note the Minister for Health referred to the MBS item number for remote renal dialysis. I want to thank the minister and the government for introducing this new schedule, but I do want to ask about the price that's been agreed. The budget didn't detail the MBS item price, but I understand the schedule is for $590. The national efficient price cost each year for the healthcare services provided by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority for remote renal dialysis is approximately $690. The amount announced, and that I understand was agreed to, is somewhat less—$100 less, in fact. I understand that currently the amount per delivery of dialysis treatment at the national efficient price going to the NT government, as per the IHPA, is $671.27 for Flynn Drive in Alice Springs. For Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory, it's $731.83. Dr Paul Lawton, whom you will know, Minister, has been working as a nephrologist across the Northern Territory since 1999. He believes that anything less than $690 per episode of care will not cover the cost needed to provide the Medicare schedule item. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder, therefore, Minister, if you could tell us how you arrived at the scheduled fee of $590. Why is it less than the national efficient price and why is it less than the amount of money being given for renal dialysis services in urban centres, like Flynn Drive in Alice Springs and Nhulunbuy in the north-east of the Northern Territory, when remote dialysis will cost more? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, if you wouldn't mind, Minister, could you comment on the proposed primary care funding model that you've announced in the budget? I understand the budget papers tell us that the new model will gradually be implemented from 1 July 2019 in consultation with the Indigenous health sector to ensure resources are directed to areas of need. The new funding model will be based on patient numbers, episodes of care, remoteness and need. Are you in a position now to detail what the model will be, how it will operate and who will be disadvantaged by it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that what the government is proposing may result in a massive disincentive to Aboriginal medical services to increase their uptake of MBS item 715. Higher performing Aboriginal medical services, like the Institute for Urban Indigenous Health and others around Australia, are deeply concerned that they are going to lose out with this model. So I would appreciate it, Minister, if you could tell us what considerations have been given to this possible disincentive and what you'll be doing to address the issue when you provide us with the details of the new funding model.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I'll respond firstly to the aged-care packages. It's interesting that you refer to them as a hoax, Member for Franklin, because if you can read budget papers, you will see very clearly that 6,000 high-care places were provided in the MYEFO process. We've then allocated funding for the 40,000 that will be released on 1 July that will impact on the number of people on the waiting list. If we consider that we are moving from a figure of 87,000 to 151,000, then that is an increase of 64,000 over the next four years. I don't understand what you don't get, in terms of those figures. They are real figures within the budget. It is a $5 billion budget. Historically, your side did not do its homework. You did not look at the level of the people requiring aged-care packages; they were hidden in the process where people were allocated and had to wait for an aged-care provider to provide them. We've made it transparent. We'll continue to work through what is required in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the combination of Commonwealth home support, and the option of residential care. In some cases, families make the decision to do residential care because they cannot provide the level of support to a family member on a daily basis. There is also a $60-million capital program that we have announced as part of the next round of ACAR places. I've announced those, and aged-care providers will be able to apply. When I was down in Peterborough, talking with the rural region, I gave a commitment that we would look at the regions and allocate ACAR places based on those regions, but with a mind to looking after people living in rural, remote and regional parts of Australia—because there is a significant need in places like Peterborough, and it's important that we turn our minds to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To your question in particular, Member for Grey, the discussions I've had with the state minister on the provision of aged care within South Australia have been very fruitful. We've talked about state-owned facilities, but also about the need for small country towns to be considered in the way that we allocate aged-care places. That work is ongoing and there will be a further discussion in Alice Springs in August to look at how we address all of these.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of renal dialysis, we've made a couple of significant grants directly to organisations; in making representation for the MBS item, it's a great step forward. The work that we're doing around renal disease has involved many stakeholders. There's been a series of roundtables in which we are looking at the state's contribution, along with the Commonwealth, and at the way in which we coordinate that across the regions that need it. Giving $23 million to Purple House now enables them to provide services in your area, in particular to people who want to live on country. So we're making a concerted effort to focus on needs in rural and regional Australia for renal disease because, in working with the professionals, there is a need, also, to provide an MBS item that enables the AMSs to provide those services on the ground. In a discussion that both Minister Hunt and I had with her, Natasha Fyles was extremely pleased at the outcome of the MBS item, because it enables the Territory to work with us to provide a far better coverage than we have in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding model for Aboriginal community-controlled health services has been a process in which NACCHO have been involved in two working parties looking at the distribution of the funding. They came to us with a proposition initially, around the way in which high-performing providers should be given encouragement to expand their opportunities of providing a much more comprehensive and better service, based on the Brisbane model. In those discussions, they've agreed to a formula. We've frozen it, in the sense that we are staging the new system. The community-controlled health services will work with us continually on that process, and we will make sure that they're involved in the co-design of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank you for your ongoing interest in the issue, Member for Franklin, and I certainly will continue the process I have with you in which I meet with you fortnightly, and I'll keep you informed on the matters that you raise.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I want to go to some of the savings measures that are contained in the Health portfolio, but, first, I want to note a number of the spending measures that are contained within the Health portfolio. They are measures that, in general, we support. I don't want to hear the sort of nonsense we heard from the minister after the last budget around diagnostic imaging—around us not supporting budget measures. I think it would be undignified if he were to do that again. I also want to note that it was a year ago that the minister used this very forum to speak fairly disrespectfully about a respected health journalist. The minister was ultimately forced to apologise for that conduct, but we've since learned that there's a bit of a pattern of behaviour from this minister, so I hope that we can conduct the debate with a bit more dignity this year than we did last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget before us includes, in the Health portfolio, $1 billion worth of additional savings, and those savings include $416 million from the GP visa changes, which are attributed to the Health portfolio. Whilst the measure itself sits in the Home Affairs portfolio, the savings are attributed to the Health portfolio. The savings also include $336 million from increased use of generic and biosimilar medicines; $190 million from the MBS review; $78 million from improved use of blood products and antirheumatic drugs; and $40 million from MedicineWise and the National Return of Unwanted Medicines project. Frankly, compared to the fairly deep and terrible cuts we saw in the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 budgets, $1 billion may not seem a great deal, but I think it does warrant some scrutiny here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I want to go to the $416 million that is attributed to savings to the Health portfolio from the visa changes for GPs. The AMA, in particular, has argued that these savings will not be realised because patients will move to other GPs. The government is insistent that the savings will actually be realised. There is a problem here. Either the government is saying that, because of the visa changes, there will be $416 million in savings because of a reduction in Medicare service usage as a result of fewer GP services being billed in those areas, which are largely rural and remote areas, or it actually has a hole in its budget. That is the problem. Either the government has a hole in its budget or it is in fact counting on a $416 million reduction in Medicare service usage. As I said, the government is insistent that these savings will be realised, and, frankly, $416 million is equivalent to 11 million GP visits. That is a lot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, of course, another question here: where is the money from these savings going? The government claims it will reinvest or redirect these savings into the entirety of the Health portfolio. There's no guarantee at all about how it intends to do so. An example of that is the $190 million that has been taken from the MBS review. We've supported that review. This removes some MBS items and changes eligibility or usage requirements for some MBS items, but the listings in this budget show that there are only $25 million of new MBS listings. Funding the projected growth in Medicare services is not funding new Medicare services nor funding new innovation in Medicare. It is funding the overall portfolio, but it is not funding new innovation, so that is in fact a cut to Medicare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the cuts to Medicare have had a substantial impact on out-of-pocket costs. We are seeing out-of-pocket costs going up substantially under this government, and that is forcing Australians to skip basic health care. This government does not have a plan to actually tackle those increasing out-of-pocket costs, which have largely occurred because of this government's freeze on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. I note that, as of today, not a single part of that freeze has been lifted. On 1 July, we will see some relief in relation to GPs and some specialists, but the remainder of the freeze, large parts of the freeze, continue until 2020. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to again draw the government's attention to reports around a trading of MRI licences for One Nation's vote on tax cuts. I want to ask the minister: instead of horsetrading with life-saving MRIs, will you support our plan to fund 20 new MRI licences around the country; and are you still insistent on your $416 million cut to Medicare services?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  My electorate of Murray is one that I believe is not considerably different to many of the other regional seats in the House of Representatives. I think that my electorate of Murray mirrors a large portion of regional Australia in relation to its needs for health and medical services. The electorate covers over 16,000 square kilometres, and the countryside varies from the rolling hills of the Strathbogie Ranges to the very flat irrigation area of the Goulburn Valley, with extensive farming out to the west and the beautiful prime cropping area around the Dookie Hills. Murray has one major population centre, that being Shepparton, with an urban population of over 50,000 people, but there are many medium-sized satellite towns such as Echuca, with 13,000 people, and over 20,000 if you consider its twin town of Moama. Kyabram has over 7½ thousand people, Cobram 6,000 people, Yarrawonga 7,000 people and Tatura 4,000 people. We then move into a small range of towns, hamlets and villages such as Violet Town, Euroa, Murchison, Nagambie, Girgarre, Strathmerton, Merrigum, Pyramid Hill, Inglewood, Wedderburn, Boort and on it goes out through the west—smaller towns, each of them with their respective and different health needs and services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am painting this picture widely because of the diverse spread and demographics in this area, which has unique needs, particularly when it comes to health services. The populations and the tyranny of distance are great challenges in providing basic health services to the people of Murray, and I know this is just a generic snapshot of regional and rural Australia. Over recent weeks, I've had the opportunity to meet a number of healthcare providers, and over the two years that I've been in this job as the member for Murray I think I've visited every healthcare facility in the electorate of Murray. We have many aged-care providers, from Shepparton Villages, which is one of the largest aged-care facilities outside of the capital cities, right through to some of the much smaller ones. I've spoken to a whole range of pharmacists, who also provide amazing services. Only two weeks ago I had my annual flu shot in a pharmacy in Shepparton. General practitioners are also struggling to recruit and retain doctors for their practices, and this tends to extend the waiting times for patients to get appointments. There is a general lack of rural generalists, and this has been a problem for way too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation is bringing to light some of the investments that the government has made and the positive steps it has taken to try and address these shortages. We had a huge announcement last year by the then Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, David Gillespie, in relation to the appointment of our Rural Health Commissioner, Emeritus Professor Paul Worley. The commissioner's first priority is to develop the National Rural Generalist Pathway, and he is well on the way to delivering that pathway. It must be understood that we do not need more doctors. We have, in essence, enough doctors throughout Australia. The medical students are actually worried about whether or not they're going to get a job. The biggest problem we have is the maldistribution of those positions throughout Australia. It has been the National Party's long-held belief that we need a series of end-to-end medical schools in the Murray-Darling region. This came to fruition when Senator McKenzie was able to announce that, in conjunction with the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University, we are going to be able to offer students from the Goulburn Valley the opportunity to do end-to-end medical training, to do an undergraduate degree to become a medical doctor and then to undertake a larger array of the specialist courses that one needs to undertake on the journey from being an aspiring medical student to actually having your area of specialty in the future. This $95 million commitment for the Murray-Darling medical school network has come to fruition now, and those students in the Goulburn Valley are going to be the beneficiaries. Minister, can you outline some of the benefits of having more doctors, more specialists, in regional Australia due to these medical schools?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  When it comes to health, not only does the budget lock in another billion dollars of new savings to Medicare; it also seeks to lock in the Prime Minister's cuts to our public hospitals for another seven years. The minister and the government are desperately trying to deny that there are cuts here, so I want to take the opportunity to take you through some of the facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in government we signed the National Health Reform Agreement, an historic agreement that ended the blame game when it came to the Commonwealth and the states in terms of hospital funding. That agreement was signed back in 2011. Under that agreement the Commonwealth committed to fund an equal share of efficient growth in hospital costs, ending that blame game and giving public hospitals long-term certainty. Ahead of the 2013 election, the Liberals promised they would 'support the transition to the Commonwealth providing 50 per cent growth in funding'. It's worth repeating the coalition's own so-called policy to support Australia's health system—a document I noted, when I first waved it around, the minister at the table had appeared not to have actually read. That policy promised that the government would fund 50 per cent of hospital growth. But the government has simply broken that promise. It is only funding 45 per cent of efficient growth, with a new 6.5 per cent cap on Commonwealth growth. The independent Parliamentary Budget Office says that the difference between 50 per cent and 45 per cent is $715 million, from 2017 to 2020, cut from the public hospital system. That cut is shared across every hospital in the country. It includes a cut of $2.9 million to Caboolture Hospital, a cut of a million dollars to the North West Regional Hospital and a cut of $8.1 million to Rosebud Hospital and Peninsula Health in the minister's own electorate.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Medical Association's 2018 Public Hospital Report Card shows that these cuts are hurting hospitals today—every doctor, every nurse, every patient. It reveals that bed ratios for older Australians continue to fall and are now at their lowest level on record. Emergency department waiting times have worsened, with up to half of urgent patients not being seen within clinically recommended times. Elective surgery waiting times remain too long, with most jurisdictions failing to treat most urgent patients within the recommended 90 days. The AMA highlights that this substandard performance is a direct result of inadequate funding. They say:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… public hospitals continue to face a funding crisis—one that is rapidly eroding their capacity to provide essential services …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AMA has been critical of the formula that the government is using for its funding and for its cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget the government is locking those cuts in for another seven years. Between the next election and 2025, the budget would mean a further $2.8 billion being cut from Australia's public hospitals. Australians know that Labor is right, but, of course, they don't just need to listen to Labor on this issue. The AMA says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The current funding formula will doom our public hospitals to fail, and patients will suffer as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the minister's record funding for public hospitals, and the legacy he is prepared to inflict on public hospitals and public patients across the country. Put simply, contrary to the minister's claims of record funding, the independent experts say that the government's funding formula is not keeping up with demand. Doing better than the member for Warringah in the 2014 budget is not something to be proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in the meantime, when we see that funding is going to continue to be cut from our public hospitals, I ask: will the minister honour his government's commitment to fund 50 per cent of growth in the efficient price of hospital funding? It is a commitment that you went to the election in 2013 saying that you were going to deliver. Will you deliver your own election promises? If not, can the minister finally admit, as his department has already been willing to admit, that 45 per cent is less than 50 per cent and that this cut is hurting every hospital, every patient, every doctor, every nurse and everybody in the country?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  The Local Sporting Champions grants program is extremely popular in Tangney and, no doubt, in Deputy Speaker Hastie's electorate of Canning, and it's appreciated by our communities. It's so popular that in Tangney each and every round is oversubscribed. I want to give you some statistics. In the 2017-18 Local Sporting Champions program, 126 local young athletes worked with their families to apply for only 36 grants available for the Tangney electorate. Recent rounds saw 53 applications for 22 available grants, and 35 applications for just six grants in the electorate of Tangney. Tangney athletes are very fortunate to receive 12 extra grants in the reallocation process, but 78 young athletes in Tangney who trained hard and applied effort still missed out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is such high demand in my community for these very important grants because the $500 Local Sporting Champions grants are a real financial support to these young athletes and their families. Athletes set their sights on national and international competitions. They train hard and ask families and friends for support, including financial support, to get them to competitions. Mums and dads and volunteers put so much time into their sporting clubs—running teams, doing rosters, coaching and umpiring. This $500 federal contribution means a lot when families are juggling the big costs of travel and competition—especially to those from electorates like Deputy Speaker Hastie's and my own, in Western Australia, when they balance their expenses. This government has supported such a wide variety of athletes in Tangney, including athletes participating in soccer, sailing, rugby, weightlifting, ice skating, hockey, cricket and rowing. At my Local Sporting Champions afternoon tea, hosted at my office, we have celebrated participation and achievements in basketball, badminton, cycling, volleyball and calisthenics. It's a real highlight to hear each of the athletes share their stories, compare training and share tips. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the Local Sporting Champions review with the Australian Sports Commission, I made a submission asking for this important program to be expanded further and for fairer consideration of support for athletes that fly longer distances to compete. I'll give you one example. Young sportsmen and sportswomen travelling from my electorate on long flights to an event, for example, here in Canberra, with all their excess baggage full of equipment for their national competition, get the same $500 grant as kids that come from Sydney. Do you know the cost of a bus fare from Sydney? It is $64 return. Yet those kids from Sydney can get the same $500 grant as kids from electorates in Western Australia. So my submission included feedback from Tangney sporting clubs and young athletes who wanted to highlight the real cost differentials in relation to their expenses and also thank the government for the difference that the contribution makes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the best news in the federal budget for the young athletes in my electorate and for those who are passionate about local sport was the expansion of the Local Sporting Champions grants program. In my community, it's something we've been campaigning for. There has been a 56 per cent increase to this important program in the budget. On current funding, that represents 3,000 additional young athletes from across Australia, including Tangney, who will receive federal government support to attend these important competitions. I want to make sure the extra grants go to young athletes like the ones in Tangney, who, to compete, fly long distances at great cost compared to people who drive or catch a bus between eastern state capitals. The expansion of this important grant program is a great opportunity to support those young athletes who have the greatest need. A fairer distribution of grants that better factors in the distance of the competition will keep more young competitors involved in sport, competing at national and international levels. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Local Sporting Champions grant recipients are the next generation of world champions, and set ambitious goals. I want to make sure that we do everything we can to make their dreams of representing Australia come true. The extension of the Local Sporting Champions grants program is a great start which will keep more young competitors involved in sport and help them achieve their full potential. Can the minister update us on the increased funding in the budget for local sporting champions? Can the minister please confirm that this increase will support more WA and more Tangney athletes in their travel to international and national sporting competitions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  In the lead-up to this budget we heard a lot of rhetoric about how great it was going to be for older Australians and the ageing. One of the things this budget does is keep in some of the cuts that were made to the aged-care funding instrument, the ACFI, over previous years. In previous years we have seen billions of dollars cut from residential aged care through this government's cutting of the ACFI. Providers tell me that the cuts that were made will not be fully realised in residential facilities across the country till around Christmas this year. In this budget we saw some money for home care packages, but we know that that money came from residential aged care—indeed, I believe that $1.6 billion, on top of billions of dollars already cut, came from residential aged care. All of this, ironically, comes at a time when the government is trying to get a new quality framework through the parliament. I don't know how you can get a quality framework when you're cutting service delivery in residential aged care, because that's essentially what the cuts to ACFI and the cuts in this budget to residential aged care do. Those cuts mean fewer services for older Australians in residential aged care. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder whether the minister agrees with the Prime Minister's comments in question time today, when he said that aged-care workers should 'aspire to get a better job'. It's an outrageous slur on workers in the aged-care sector, who are caring for more than a million people who are receiving aged-care services.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms COLLINS:</span>
                  </a>  The Prime Minister directly said today that people in aged care should 'aspire to get a better job'. I wonder whether the government and the minister over there agree with this. We on this side of the house actually support aged-care workers. We admire the hard work that they do every day in residential aged care, day in, day out, supporting older Australians. It was an insult to them and an outrageous slur when the Prime Minister of the country stood up in question time today and said that they should aspire to get a better job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything in this budget, this government's past cuts of billions of dollars to residential aged care, the fact that they've delayed action on the workforce and the fact their workforce task force doesn't have a workers representative on it show that this government does not support workers in the aged-care system, particularly those in residential care, and we heard that clearly from the Prime Minister today. Australians who are caring for older Australians, who are vulnerable, who need support, deserve some respect. They are not the highest paid workers in the country, that is true, but they work extraordinarily hard, day in, day out, trying to support older Australians, their loved ones and their carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Prime Minister to apologise for what he said in parliament today, and this minister should ensure that the Prime Minister does apologise for what he said in parliament today, because aged-care workers in Australia deserve better. They deserve much better than what we saw from this government today. The history of aged care under this government is one of a revolving door of ministers—it's up to three ministers—and cuts in the past. So to have the government say that this budget is so wonderful for older Australians and then to have the comments from the Prime Minister today shows exactly what this government thinks of older Australians and the people who work to support them. Quite frankly, it's extraordinarily disappointing, and I would have expected much better.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Health, the senior minister here, said prior to the budget that it was going to be a very good budget for health, and for aged care in particular. We know now that not one extra dollar is going to aged care that wasn't already in the forward estimates.</span>

                  </a>  The minister might want to answer some questions instead of trying to be patronising, saying I don't know how to read a budget. I do know how to read a budget, Minister. There are over 100,000 Australians still waiting for home care packages. You know that, and everybody in this place knows that—but, importantly, older Australians and their loved ones know that. They know that they are still waiting for packages. You've been in government for five years, there have been three ministers, and billions of dollars have been cut. You need to take responsibility for the crisis that you have created whilst you have been in government, and you should stop perpetuating a hoax on older Australians.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALEXANDER:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you very much; I was just looking for a compliment! After my sporting career, I got into the business of developing health clubs, in Adelaide, in Perth, in Sydney, in Canberra and in Auckland. In fact, the one in Sydney is in the electorate that I now serve, in Ryde. We developed the Sydney Olympic centre there, with the Next Generation Club. There were three criteria for the development of Olympic facilities. It had to house an Olympic event, it had to give service to the community afterwards, and it had to be viable. And I'm pleased to say that the Ryde Aquatic Leisure Centre of the Next Gen Club is the only one of the Olympic venues that met all three criteria. It remains viable, and one million people benefit from that each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This followed on from my father, who got involved in preventive medicine at a point in time and started an executive fitness club with Les Gonner, who was a physical trainer and trained a lot of athletes, and Dr Bernard Lake, who was Australia's first preventive medico. The idea was to actually extend life through exercise and diet, and this was to be judged on the basis of insurance companies and their projection of life expectancy, based on the criteria of blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fat levels, lifestyle and other factors. At the commencement of this enterprise—which still operates today; this was started in 1965—several of the men who were commencing the exercise program were actually older than their life expectancy. They were literally ticking time bombs. They had high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels, they were terribly overweight, and they had dreadful lifestyles of eating too much and drinking too much. But with an exercise program three mornings a week and a healthy breakfast, they turned their lives around and became exemplars of what healthy ageing should be. They were physically active, they were mentally active, they were engaged; they had a camaraderie amongst each other where there was a great penalty if anyone failed to show. So it was a very, very successful effort and it showed me what could be done. Hence my getting into politics, because this was one of my great interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, in the local community, I've approached one of the pharmacies in the Macquarie Centre, the medical centre, and the Fitness First club to discuss the prospect of initiating a prescription of exercise so that people who present at the pharmacy can be advised, if they're in a modest condition, to go to Fitness First and engage in a fitness program—that is, they get a prescription of exercise. If they present in a worse condition, they should have medical advice and therefore a higher level of care when they are going to exercise, and be careful not to overexercise, until they get into shape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area that I think is very important. I would like to see this type of program rolled out because, when we often talk about the cost of exercise and the cost of these programs, it's a far greater cost if we do nothing. One of the biggest costs in our health system is that of treating lifestyle illness—illness as a result of poor lifestyle. So I look forward to this being rolled out across the country, and I ask the minister to elaborate on the government's efforts to promote preventive medicine and sport. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I want to now turn particularly to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the National Immunisation Program. New listings on the PBS and the NIP are always welcome. The minister quite rightly points out that the new listings in the budget will help prevent and treat disease, including refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma, spinal muscular atrophy and breast cancer. I have personally congratulated the minister on the listing of SPINRAZA. I know many people in this place have met with people from the SMA community, including me. It's a very tragic disease. I also note that the government's investments out of the Medical Research Future Fund in prospective parent testing, and I met with the Murdoch Children's Research Institute to talk to them about that policy initiative prior to the government doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly make three points in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits schedule. The first—and I've made this point before—is that PBS listing, since the Chifley government introduced the PBS, is the business of government. It is what governments do. The last Labor government spent over $6 billion to add around 800 new medicines and vaccines to the PBS and to the NIP, and the Life Saving Drugs Program. But we, of course, understood that the credit for these listings does not belong to the minister of the day. They should not be treated as his personal gift to the nation. Credit belongs to the medicine companies that develop these new treatments, the patients, clinicians and researchers that help build the evidence for them, and the independent committees that ensure that these new listings are cost effective and are effective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My second point is, whether they admit it or not, the government are having the same problems that Labor did in government: new high-cost drugs that are coming onto the PBS are increasingly difficult to fund. That is the reality of what's happening. It's happening in every single developed country across the globe. The minister's very fond of talking about the seven drugs that were listed by the last Labor government. All of these drugs were, in fact, listed within a year. Perhaps the mistake Labor made is that we were honest about the struggle we were had to find the money for those drugs. We were honest and up-front about it. But the government has exactly the same problem, and it serves nobody at all that the government tries to pretend otherwise, because this is a problem of reform that successive governments are going to have to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at the drugs listed in this budget alone, we've seen substantial delays from the government between PBAC recommendation and listing. They are substantial delays, and I want to use some of the examples. The government delayed the multiple sclerosis drug for seven months from PBAC recommendation to listing, the Hodgkinson lymphoma drug for nine months, the whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women by 16 months and the second whooping cough vaccine by two years. Those delays exist under this government, and for the minister to pretend otherwise is simply dishonest. These sorts of delays are problematic for everybody. What's the government's response? The Medicines Partnership of Australia points out that the budget continues the trend of PBS expenditure continuing to decline in real terms. That's what they said. We understand the minister or his office got very angry about a press release the partnership put out clearly saying that these are the facts and asked that a second press release be issued. I think that's, frankly, pretty appalling. If you're not able to take criticism from the sector for decisions that you've taken, I don't know what that says about you. This sort of intimidation seems to be a bit typical of this government, but that's how it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point I particularly want to make is the PBS has been, and should always be, defined by a rigorous focus on clinical and cost effectiveness. Successive governments and oppositions have accepted the advice of independent experts on whether medicines should be listed and whether they are eligible for so-called special pricing arrangements. For the first time ever, this minister has rejected the PBAC's advice and granted a special deal. At Senate estimates last month, the minister's own officials described that decision as 'highly unusual'. We must not allow this minister or this government to politicise the PBS in this way. It is a very dangerous path to go down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, for ministers who ignore or cherrypick PBAC advice, the recommendations of the independent committee risk chipping away at the trust in the drug-listing system that has served us so well. So I ask the minister: will you come clean about why you rejected the advice of PBAC on this drug? Is it, as was reported, because you wanted the manufacturer's support for a trial of new payment arrangements announced in the 2018 budget? How can the minister boast about listing all drugs when we've seen delays of up to two years from PBAC recommendations under the minister? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I'll try to deal with a series of questions raised by members on all sides of the House. In relation to the member for Murray, I'm delighted that we have been able to provide once-in-a-generation support for rural and regional health within Australia. The package, which was $550 million of investment, is significant. It is built around a simple premise: delivering 3,000 extra doctors and 3,000 extra nurses to rural and regional Australia. It does that through additional support for teaching, through the Murray-Darling Basin medical school network—something I was privileged to be involved in, by working with each of the universities that are part of it in conjunction with other members of this parliament. It works, for the first time, in providing the equivalent of a rural provider number for junior doctors who seek to advance their careers in rural and regional Australia, by allowing them access to Medicare. I know that is something you yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, raised with me as a proposition. It also ensures that there is additional support for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals through different workforce programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the issue raised by the shadow minister, there is a simple proposition: funding for Medicare is a record each year, every year. To lay out the budget figures: $25 billion, $26 billion, $27 billion and $29 billion. Those are the budget figures, each year a record. What we see is a series of important things here. In particular, we see a false claim that there had been no indexation. Indeed, the bulk-billing incentive has already been indexed and, I believe, in 12 days the next round in relation to general practice items and specialist consultations will commence. In addition to that—again, I point out the false claim—there is $4.8 billion of additional expenditure in the budget set out in relation to Medicare. No doubt, question or otherwise: every dollar is reinvested. Every dollar is part of that $4.8 billion of growth to record levels each year, every year, in relation to Medicare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the relation to the PBS, what this budget does is reverse the $1.9 billion of cuts to the PBS which were recorded under Labor in the 2010 budget with $2.4 billion of additional investment. There is $1.4 billion in listed new medicines, including for non-small-cell lung cancer. A new drug for non-small-cell lung cancer is something the Labor Party now opposes—in only the last case, where the department followed all the procedures, and it was only negotiated with the department. In addition to that, we also see $1 billion of contingency or headroom to deal with the very problem which Labor couldn't address but which the shadow minister acknowledged was the reason they deliberately failed to take action and announced that they would not be taking steps in their time on their watch. That's the difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to hospitals, very clearly, each year and every year there is record funding: $21 billion, $22 billion, $23 billion and $24 billion. More than that, I am surprised that they raised the case of Caboolture, because the Caboolture Hospital is part of the Brisbane metro area. In the last full financial year the Commonwealth investment in that area went up $120 million. The Queensland Labor government went down $21 million. It's a little embarrassing, I would say, and I would quietly counsel them that it may not be the best example they could be using. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we see that Labor itself has walked away from its own funding formula. Can it guarantee that the so-called additional money will be allocated on an activity basis to every hospital in the country? Already we are seeing random allocations, which means that some areas will be robbed to pay for random projects that are being picked based on what is perceived to be an electoral need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Local Sporting Champions program, I can say with great confidence to the member for Tangney that there will be an $11.8 million increase, with 9,000 new grants, and the program will particularly focus on the needs of those travelling long distances and from rural and remote areas. All up, I think that's an outstanding set of outcomes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  One of the things we've had bipartisanship on in this place has been suicide prevention. I want to talk about the serious subject of mental health and suicide prevention, and I want to put on record that Labor is committed to supporting measures that support those Australians who are living with mental ill health. We have had bipartisanship on this from the government in the past. Since the minister has come into the Health portfolio, there has been a distinct pattern of copying some of Labor's policies, which is fine because we obviously are very proud of our policies. Prior to the last election, we announced our mental health commitment on 20 June 2016, and the government announced its policy just six days later, in relation to suicide prevention trial sites. But the government committed to only eight sites. It was very good that, when the minister was first given responsibility for mental health, he funded another four suicide prevention trial sites, to bring it up to the 12 trial sites that Labor first proposed. Indeed, we welcomed this at the time, because it is good policy to have more trial sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government began rolling out the suicide prevention trial sites, it became very clear that the PHNs on the ground needed more time to implement the suicide prevention trial sites. Having been briefed on some of them and having met with some of the consultation groups, providers and consumers around the country, it became very clear to me that they were not able to deliver on-ground services until the last 12 months or so and that the suicide prevention trial sites would need to be extended for a further period of time, to allow proper evidence and data collection so that we could get the best data out of them to try to reduce suicide in this country. I wrote to the minister on three separate occasions requesting that the trial sites be extended. I publicly called on the minister, on numerous occasions, to do this, particularly for those trial sites that are being run in rural and regional Australia. I had great concerns that a lot of the money was going into administration rather than into on-ground services. We didn't see anything in the budget, and I was concerned about that and I raised that. I was pleased to see that the media release from the minister six days after the budget actually said that the suicide prevention trial sites are now to be extended. So I've got some questions for the minister around that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly interested to know whether or not the PHNs contacted the government and the minister about the suicide prevention trial site period; whether they requested an extension; how long an extension they requested versus how long they've actually been given; and whether or not there are any additional funds, particularly for the rural and regional suicide prevention trial sites, where they have spent a lot of money on administration and getting to the point, and they've got fewer on-ground services. I know that six Labor members and senators wrote to the minister—it came out of estimates—about the suicide prevention trial extension sites in their seats. People from both sides of parliament have taken great interest in this in their local areas because they are concerned to make sure that we get the very best possible evidence and data from these trial sites. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm keen to know when the minister actually made the decision to extend the suicide prevention trial sites, why it wasn't included in the budget and why we received notification six days after the budget that this was being extended. And, as I said, I would like to know about any additional money that's going to specific trial sites and what sites are going to get the additional money. I'm particularly concerned, as I said, about some of the trial sites in rural and regional Australia, such as the Kimberley trial site, because I know that they did spend a fair amount of their $3 million through the PHN on holding meetings and consultations and getting everything together in terms of the plan. I wonder if the minister could also let me know exactly when he expects to receive some of the initial reports from Black Dog Institute, who are doing some of the evaluations of the trial sites, whether those evaluations are going to be made public and whether we can receive a briefing on those valuations when they come through so that we know what is happening on the ground in the suicide prevention trial sites, because in this place we're all really concerned to make sure that this works.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  This afternoon I'll be asking some questions of the Minister for Health. They may seem a little bit esoteric insofar as they relate to Defence and Defence personnel, but I believe that they're inextricably linked. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not far from this place, we have the War Memorial. We've got to remember that there are tens of thousands of men and women who have served this country in uniform. In fact, in areas of my own electorate, we have our own much smaller war memorials. For all of those men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice, there are men and women who have served this country who have returned home bearing the psychological scars of their experiences, both at war and also serving in the military.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the public at large PTSD is perhaps the most well known of these psychological impacts. Sadly, however, our clinical knowledge of the condition and its effective treatment, though growing, is not terribly great. While treatments are increasingly successful, with as many as three quarters of sufferers who receive treatment substantially improving within 12 months, the precise causes and mechanisms involved in PTSD remain unclear. It's likely that further research could yield more effective diagnostic tools and treatment approaches. The minister is aware of Dr Jim Lagopoulos and the Thompson Institute in my electorate of Fisher. They're currently working on proposals for further research into the physical changes in the brain which accompany PTSD. I look forward to my ongoing discussions with the minister as to how the government might support that work in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, I'd like the minister to please outline to the chamber what the government is doing to support research into mental health conditions, specifically PTSD, to help us understand and treat these conditions more effectively. One piece of research which the government has already commissioned is the transition and wellbeing research program study on mental health disorders' prevalence, which was released this year. It showed the true scale of poor mental health among veterans. Of transitioned ADF members, 46.4 were estimated to have experienced a mental disorder in the past 12 months alone—46.4 per cent of transitioned members. Of those, nearly one in five suffered from PTSD. Almost three-quarters are estimated, in the report, to have lived with a mental disorder at some point in their life. Among serving personnel, 8.3 per cent had experienced PTSD in just the last year. Unfortunately, conditions like PTSD among veterans can have the most tragic consequences. The same report found that in the past 12 months alone, 21.2 per cent of transitioned members of the ADF had considered taking their own lives. I know that the minister has taken a passionate and personal interest in improving the mental health of all Australians, including our ADF veterans. So, secondly, I'd like to ask the minister what the government is doing to support the mental health of our ADF veterans, because our ADF veterans are at particular risk of poor mental health because of high stress and traumatic experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've also got to recognise is that our first responders, our ambos, our firies and our police will quite often see more death and carnage in a 20- or 30-year career on the streets back home than our soldiers, airmen or sailors might see in a career in the military. Our first responders, our emergency service workers, also suffer terribly from PTSD. My brother is one of them. He's been an ambo for 30 years. Just as we as a federal government look to repair our broken soldiers—rightly so—I'd like to ask the minister what we are looking to do to assist our first-line responders. I know some will say that's a state issue, but these men and women endure, without overplaying it, the worst of all horrors that we see in modern-day life, and we need to do more. I'd like to ask the minister what his intentions are to help our first-line responders.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  This budget was also an opportunity for the Minister for Health to commit to one of his own key mental health promises, and that was a specific plan for Australians who have eating disorders. In May 2017, the minister first recommended the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce investigate options for Medicare coverage for the treatment of those living with an eating disorder. In this place last night, we heard directly from the Parliamentary Friends of Mental Illness about somebody living with an eating disorder and about her recovery and survival. It was quite a traumatic thing to listen to. Nearly one year later, the Medicare task force clinical committee finally met for the first time to look at this issue. The minister stated in March of this year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… what I have done is requested that the MBS Taskforce consider extended eating disorder treatment, a new item of Medicare … they have my commitment and my support that if they propose we will announce this funding …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in estimates, the Department of Health could not confirm whether or not a new Medicare item was still being considered. Indeed, the departmental officer at the table said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no advice in front of the government at this stage … There is no recommendation … The Eating Disorders Working Group is still considering what advice it wants to put forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department also confirmed that to date there have been no costings undertaken at all by the agency or the government in relation to whether or not there is a Medicare item going to be developed for eating disorders. After the budget there was an announcement on eating disorders by the minister, and we understand that there's now an eating disorder trial that's going to commence on the Sunshine Coast, and of course we welcome that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that eating disorders are a really serious issue. They know no boundaries and are experienced by men and women of all ages. There are serious consequences of eating disorders, and we heard directly last night about what they can do. They affect around a million Australians. We know that, of all psychiatric illnesses, eating disorders have a very high mortality rate, and they have a devastating effect not just on the individual but on their carers, family and loved ones. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm keen to know from the minister exactly what is happening in relation to an Medicare MBS item for eating disorders, where the task force is at, where the eating disorders working group is at, whether or not the government is serious about this issue and whether or not the minister is actually going to commit to having a new Medicare item number if it's proposed. When does the minister expect to have some action in relation to this? How is the Sunshine Coast proposal going to work in terms of people accessing services and the funding? Is the government considering a trial anywhere other than the Sunshine Coast at the moment? I'm particularly interested to know whether or not trials are going to be located in particular seats around the country as we lead up to the election. I want to know: why the ad hoc nature of some of these announcements, and, particularly, why are they outside of the budget process? It would be very interesting to hear from the minister exactly what is happening when it comes to eating disorders and the MBS item that he made a commitment to—whether or not the government is going to deliver on that and how long this is actually going to take. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard last night, people living with eating disorders are having terrible trouble trying to access services. I know the minister is aware of that. He would've heard similar stories from people around the country. It is very difficult indeed to get the allied health services and psychological support that people living with eating disorders need. They do often need more than just the eight or 10 Better Access visits that they can access. They often need care over many years, not just over a short period of time. It's a very serious illness and it has very severe consequences. I'm keen to hear from the minister and the government about when the government is going to act, how the Sunshine Coast proposal is going to work with the trial, whether or not there's going to be an evaluation of the trial, when the government expects to have that, when the MBS task force is expected to report to government and when we're going to get action. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  One of the most exciting elements of the budget for people in central western New South Wales was the announcement of the Murray-Darling medical schools network. The Murray-Darling medical school proposal has been sought and pushed and advocated for by people in central and western New South Wales for about 10 years. Why have they felt so strongly about it? Why have we felt so strongly about it? The answer is simple: it's because country people die younger than people in the city. That's just the way it is. That's the cold hard truth of the situation: country people die younger than city people. Their health outcomes are worse at just about every single level. People in country communities know what it's like to go without medical services of all varieties. We know what it's like to not have enough doctors. In some of our country communities you can wait weeks or months just to see a GP, let alone a specialist. When existing GPs retire or move town, often there's no-one there to replace them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there has been a huge groundswell of support for the Murray-Darling medical schools network. The concept is very simple: to train doctors in the bush for practice in the bush, as they are doing at James Cook University in North Queensland, with about 80 per cent of places to be quarantined for country students. The idea is that if you take country people, if you train them in the country, they're more likely to stay in the country when they graduate. Indeed, Charles Sturt University has proved this to be true with their many other courses. We have toured their various campuses and faculties, and when you speak to the students, for example in pharmacy or dentistry, the ones from the country invariably say, 'When we graduate we're going back to the bush'. Indeed, if you look at the country workforce in New South Wales, 70 per cent of accountants in inland New South Wales are Charles Sturt University graduates. That's an amazing figure. So Charles Sturt University is literally training the next generation. It's training a country workforce. They have proved that this works across their health faculties and health services, but also with their new faculties such as engineering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute to all of our members of the community who have fought so hard for a new medical school in central western New South Wales. Those folks have come from all walks of life. The support has been widespread from people in local government, from local councils, from Centroc, from groups like the Country Women's Association, the mighty CWA. There have also been a number of doctors, many in fact, who have supported this proposal. They haven't been as vocal as others have, but they have been there, nevertheless, working away, offering support and guidance. I think the result, this whole new medical school network, is something that will truly be a game changer for the practice of medicine in country New South Wales and country Australia. I think it will change the way medicine is practised in country New South Wales and country Australia, because in our part of the world you are going to have a curriculum specifically tailored for practice in the bush. We are training doctors in the bush for practice in the bush. It's a very simple concept, but one we've been fighting for for many years now. I've been pushing for this for as long as I've been in politics, which is since 2011. In fact, I mentioned it in my inaugural speech to the New South Wales parliament in 2011 as being something I'd like to see. It has been a true community effort, and I would like to pay tribute to everyone who's supported the cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the minister is: can the minister please tell the chamber how the Murray-Darling medical school network came about and how it will affect the lives of people living in rural Australia? Before I close, can I also thank the minister for all of his hard work on this project. He got it over the line with the help of his ministerial colleagues, and we're very grateful.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  Following on from the comments of the member for Franklin about the promise the government made around getting an MBS item for eating disorders and the lack of progress there appears to have been on that, I flag that there have been a number of other areas where the minister has been pretty quick to try and shut down a media inquiry or to do things with stakeholders where he's made promises that haven't been delivered. I will highlight a couple of those in particular. One is in relation to catheter ablation, a commitment Hearts for Hearts believe that they had as part of the Prostheses List review. In fact, I remember being at a function where the minister said that he would deal with this issue, so that seems to be a substantially outstanding one. The other is the review of MRI licences, which was announced in response to a media inquiry. I point to the fairly outrageous fact that we have a One Nation senator claiming that they had done a deal with the government about an MRI licence for Kalgoorlie. That the government thinks it is appropriate in any way, shape or form to do a deal on $80 billion worth of tax cuts with One Nation in return for a vote on an MRI licence, is something that the government should reflect on very strongly. Frankly, if we had an independent corruption commission I would be referring that to such a commission. It's a very, very dangerous precedent to be setting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this debate there are a number of questions that have gone unanswered. The member for Franklin asked questions about the government's plan to deal with the issue of aged-care packages. There are a hundred thousand people waiting for aged-care packages, particularly for level 3 and 4 packages. The government made a promise that it would deal with this issue, and it has been totally inadequate in addressing it. We have had questions about the MBS item for dialysis and whether the amount of funding that was made available for that will be enough to deliver on making sure we have dialysis in rural and remote communities. I've asked questions about savings within the budget—particularly around the GP visa savings and whether that means that there's going to be a cut to services or a hole in the budget. The government has been totally unable to answer them, despite the fact that the AMA says that it is an issue. We've asked questions about MRI licences. And we've asked the government whether they'll finally admit what is absolutely and utterly self-evident to anybody listening to this debate: that 45 per cent is less than 50 per cent, and that means a cut in public hospital funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is a clever politician in the way he really likes selectively to use funding and in the way in which he says, 'We've got record growth in funding.' Each government can claim to have record growth in Medicare and record growth in the PBS because each government, as a result of growth in population and growth in access to services—growth in usage under activity based funding—actually sees growth in hospital funding each year and in Medicare funding each year in particular. Every government can claim that it's got record funding. But what this government has done, and needs to own, is cut public hospital funding and Medicare funding. In each and every budget when we have stood here there have been new cuts within the budget. The government likes to say 'Oh no, it's not.' Own it. This is your budget; own it. This is what you've done, so say, 'This is what we're spending.' That's great. It will either be welcomed or not welcomed—that's fine. But say what you've cut as well. Actually be up-front and honest about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had the member for Franklin ask about funding in residential aged care and the crisis that is emerging there and the billions of dollars that have been cut. I am sure the minister does desperately care about these issues. I think he's a decent person. But his senior minister, who is responsible for finding money in the portfolio, for making sure, absolutely, that there is funding, is letting his junior minister down by not making sure that they fund aged care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've asked about the PBS processes. The straw man that the minister likes to put up—he likes to do the straw man around lung cancer—is a nonsense, again. It's beneath the dignity of this parliament to think about it. This minister is actually doing something very unusual when it comes to PBAC. It's something I've referred to the Audit Office, because it has very serious consequences for the ongoing confidence and sustainability of the PBS. It is something the sector is worried about, and the minister should be concerned that he thinks it's okay. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I'll try to answer as many of the issues raised as quickly as possible. In relation to the member for Bennelong, there is $230 million of additional funding for preventive health in sport. That includes a long-term $160 million Sporting Schools program, which will make a profound and continuing difference around the country. We have a $70 million infant- and maternal-health package. That's a very important thing and, hopefully, that will have the support of all members of this House. And there is a $125 million chronic disease health fund, under the Medical Research Future Fund, with a particular focus on cardiovascular and pulmonary issues and diabetes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the issue of aged-care funding that was raised by the member for Franklin and, in passing, the member for Ballarat, yes, it is record funding, each year, every year: $21 billion, $21 billion, $22 billion and $23 billion. I am surprised that they feel this increase is in some way not an increase. It's a net increase of $5 billion over the forward estimates. For residential care, the figures go from 204,000 to 233,000 residential-care places. And for home care the figures go from 87,000 to 151,000 places. But this is a different practice, I admit, than that which was practised by the ALP when they were in government. I want to refer, for the first time, to the 2011-12 budget papers—I need to get a new hobby, rather than reading old budget papers! In that budget, under the health and aged-care section, we saw that, whereas we openly recognised that there was an underutilisation of some of the projected residential growth and transferred it to health care, the ALP took money out of residential and did not reapply it to home care. So they cut residential in the 2011-12 budget and did not reapply it. They said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This measure will provide savings of $211.7 million over five years from 2010-11, due to the lower costs associated with delivering care at home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very thing that they accused of us—which we didn't do—is the very thing, according to their own budget papers, that they did. It was not just once but in 2010, 2011 and 2012. That's three consecutive budgets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next thing is in relation to mental health, and I respect the bipartisan nature of that. There was $338 million of additional funding delivered. I particularly want to note the points made by the member for Fisher on Veterans' Affairs. We see there was an additional $100 million of funding in this budget to continue reform of supports available to veterans, including mental-health treatment to reservists, with domestic or international disaster relief or border protection services or those involved in a serious service-related incident. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge and address the questions around eating disorders. I had the privilege of being with the member for Fisher and the head of the Butterfly Foundation, who said—and I would gently point this out to the opposition—that this government has done more for eating disorders than any government. She made personal references on that front, and I was humbled and privileged to hear that. We have funded the Butterfly Foundation for their support of the ED helpline. We have worked with the InsideOut Institute at the Charles Perkins Institute on their support. Just last week we provided $3.2 million, through the Primary Health Network, for primary health funding. You asked about the time frame. Over a three-year period, that will see a 20-consultation and a 50-consultation program. It includes development and implementation of assessments with GPs, rollout of services and an evaluation period. All of those were actually announced last week—the very questions that have just been asked at this table. The information is publicly available, already announced. And it will include an evaluation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  Let me start today by saying that the coalition government is absolutely committed to delivering the highest quality education outcome for our students, while at the same time ensuring value for taxpayer money. Everything that we have done since we formed government several years ago has been underpinned by those two objectives—high-quality education outcomes and value for money. Systematically and diligently, as a government we have taken on the task of reforming the education sector—in childhood, in schools, in vocational education and in higher education. We see education as a highway, starting with child care and early learning through to school, vocational education and higher education. Each part is critical to ensuring the success and prosperity of our nation. That's why we've taken a holistic approach to education reform and introduced changes where needed across the sector. The reforms that we have introduced are fair and will lead to greater prosperity as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me touch on some of those reforms. The coalition government is delivering real reforms to all Australian schools. We are delivering real funding increases, with an extra $24.5 billion over the next 10 years. Over 2018 to 2027, Commonwealth school funding will be a record $243.5 billion. Funding grows every year, from $17.5 billion in 2017 to $29.5 billion in 2027. Commonwealth school spending for all sectors—government, Catholic and independent—grows faster than costs. And, by appointing David Gonski to lead the Review to Achieve Educational Excellence in Australian Schools, this government has signalled very clearly that it's going to tackle Australia's declining education performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government will this week debate the higher education loans bill, which, 30 years on from Labor's introduction of income-contingent loans—introduced by the Hawke-Keating government—seeks to keep the loans system sustainable for another 30 years. It is still the cheapest loan that you will get. You pay no up-front fees and get access to higher education, irrespective of background or financial means. In the meantime, those opposing the bill pretend that we can keep printing taxpayers' money and no-one will ever have to pay the piper. That would be nice but, in the end, we all have to live within our means, and that includes the Australian government, which relies on the goodwill of Australian taxpayers to continue to fund services like higher education at record levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our new early learning and childcare package balances the need for essential services such as early childhood education and care with the need to support families as they make decisions on where, how and how much they work, train, study and volunteer. We're increasing the subsidy rate from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent, benefiting more than 370,000 families earning less than around $67,000. Eighty-five per cent of families using child care will no longer be subject to the dreaded annual childcare rebate cap, meaning they can work as many days as they choose without exceeding the subsidy. High-income families will see their annual cap increase to just over $10,000. While we estimate that this package will encourage more than 230,000 Australian families to increase their workforce participation, it's equally important to note that our $1.2 billion child care safety net is designed to support those who legitimately cannot work for a range of reasons, including poor health. Families in casual work can estimate their activity over a three-month period and apply that consistently for that period. This enables these families to secure child care as they need it. Based on the income data and other details from families who have made the switch to the new system ahead of its start on 2 July, family budgets are set to be around $1,333 a year better off on average per child. Relief is on the way for families who have been struggling with the cost of child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few seconds that I have left, can I just say with respect to vocational education and training that the Australian government is absolutely committed to growing the number of apprentices that we have to meet the skills needs, both now and in the future. The Skilling Australians Fund has been signed by a number of states and territories and has indicated clearly that we are on the road to meeting our skills needs.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  I thank the assistant minister for her opening remarks. How very disappointing, however, to hear her talk about how we can't fund education properly because we can't keep printing taxpayers' dollars, and that we all have to live within our means. There's no question at all that if this government had its priorities right, it would not be making $80 billion worth of big business tax cuts and cutting education funding at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is particularly disappointing when it comes to education because we can draw a parallel: between the $17 billion cut from our schools over the next decade, compared with what Labor's formula would have delivered for these schools. And there is the $17 billion of big business tax cuts that will go directly to the banks. I think if you asked the average person in the street whether they would rather spend $17 billion of their—indeed—taxpayers' money on a tax cut to the big banks or on proper funding of our schools, I'm pretty sure I know what they would answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget locks in a completely inequitable funding formula, with the government capping its share of funding for public schools at 20 per cent of the schooling resource standard and contributing 80 per cent for private schools. I don't know in what weird definition of 'sector-blind' this government came up with the idea that public schools should have 20 per cent of their needs funded by the Commonwealth and private schools should have 80 per cent of their needs met by the Commonwealth. In what world is that sector-blind? It actually could not be more sector-specific. This funding model is neither fair nor sector-blind nor needs based.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incidentally, we've heard a lot about the second Gonski review and the 23 recommendations. The government, apparently, has accepted those 23 recommendations but there is nothing in this budget to reflect that. For example, one of the recommendations is for an evidence institute. Earlier this year, Labor committed to funding for an evidence institute. We set aside $280 million over a decade so that we do this properly. How much in this budget is set aside for an evidence institute? The government, apparently, has accepted the recommendations, they've said that they'll fund it, but what? Big fat zero in this budget. There is no new money attached to any of the 23 recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to universities, this budget locks in $2.2 billion of cuts that were made last December. Of course we don't think that's fair, and we've already said that we would return to a demand driven system. Modelling from the Mitchell Institute shows that the government's cuts—the capping of the demand driven system—means that about 200,000 more people will benefit from our plan over 12 years to uncap the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like the government to explain how these $2.2 billion of cuts are going to benefit Australian students. Today is National TAFE Day, and there is another $270 million cut from TAFE in this budget. We've got skills shortages and unemployed people. We've got terrible youth unemployment and older workers retraining to meet the needs of a changing economy, so what does this government do? It cuts $270 million from TAFE. What an extraordinary decision, coming on top of $3 billion of cuts to TAFE training and apprenticeships! There are 140,000 fewer apprentices today than when these Liberals came to office. Bricklayers, carpenters, cooks and hairdressers have all been on the National Skills Needs List for the entire time this government's been in office. We could have trained a few more of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have said that we will restore funding to TAFE, including scrapping up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students who choose to learn the skills that Australia needs; guaranteeing that at least two out of three Commonwealth dollars go to TAFE; providing 10,000 pre-apprenticeship programs for young people who want to learn a trade and 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who want to retrain; and $100 million to reinvest in modernising and upgrading TAFE facilities around the country. All of my colleagues who visit TAFEs see that, despite the great work TAFEs do, their facilities in many instances are very run down because of the cumulative effects of the Commonwealth government cuts and the state government cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also said that one in 10 jobs on Commonwealth projects will be Australian apprentices and trainees. This government's also making 280,000 families worse off because of their childcare changes. What an appalling attack on families!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  Recent reports that the Australian National University would be cancelling well-advanced plans for a degree course in Western civilisation and will reject a $2 million offer of funding from the Ramsay centre on what are undoubtedly ideological grounds demand that we ask a simple question: is the assistant minister concerned, as I am, about a growing perception that our universities are not open to debate and are not delivering on community expectations, despite being provided with record funding from the taxpayers who give them social licence to operate? What is particularly telling in this case is the simple fact that opponents of a degree course in Western civilisation clearly see it as self-evident that such a course would present an uncritically positive view of its subject matter. It says a lot about how these academics approach teaching their own courses. Surely academics who believed Western civilisation to be a bad thing would strongly encourage a critical examination of the subject. After all, we often say that those who can't remember the past are doomed to repeat it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But staff at ANU oppose such a course because they know how their university really works. They know, for example, how ANU's equivalent Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies works. This is a body funded by the governments of Dubai, Turkey and Iran which changed its name from the Centre for Middle East and Central Asian Studies immediately following a particularly large Emirati donation. It's a centre which just five years ago hosted a 9/11 conspiracy theorist, Richard Falk, who dismissed summary executions, repression of women and general human rights abuses taking place in centre donor Iran as 'happily false'. It's a centre whose director, Amin Saikal, presents a single viewpoint so divorced from reality that he described Iran as providing 'a degree of mass participation, political pluralism and assurance of certain human rights and freedoms which do not exist in most of the Middle East', and he has suggested that the coalition operations in Afghanistan and Iraq were the result of a Jewish conspiracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The implication is clear. At ANU, to study a humanities subject is to have rammed down your throat whatever predominant groupthink position is supported by the donors. This is not education; it is indoctrination. It will not produce inventive, cutting-edge thinkers for the 21st century but slavish drones to whom new ideas are a threat rather than an opportunity. We can't afford to create a generation of Australians who have been denied the chance to think for themselves in a world where knowledge and innovation will be the economic drivers of our future. Would the assistant minister therefore please outline to the House the importance of a strong and intellectually rigorous university sector in an increasingly competitive world economy, and what threat is posed by the abandonment of intellectual freedom?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who've sought to restrict freedom or enforce agreement with their own ideas have always known that the first and most important task is to control the language of the debate. We see a version of it in political discourse in this place, sadly, all the time. That's why the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite insist on dishonestly describing the coalition's ever-increasing, record funding of schools and hospitals as cuts. They know, as the many advocates of a narrow, left-wing, anti-Western world view in our universities know, that he who controls the language of debate has gone a long way towards winning before it even begins. Sadly we're seeing the results in universities in my own state of Queensland, where UQ students report that they have been marked down in assignments for using words like 'mankind' or describing ships with the grammatically correct pronoun 'she'. It is also why, in a stunning piece of doublethink, ANU have claimed that their ground for restricting diversity of thought by rejecting a course in Western civilisation is that it constitutes a threat to academic autonomy. So, finally, is the minister concerned, as I am, by the apparent rising policing of politically acceptable language in our universities and the impact this will have on the diversity of viewpoints which can be properly expressed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our universities are the nurseries of Australia's intellectual future. They are the training grounds for our next leaders and the incubators of the ideas that will preserve our nation's prosperity. Rampant politicisation, intellectual cowardice and ideological enforcement— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  What an extraordinary contribution from the previous speaker, the member for Fisher. I think it is worth reflecting on. How eloquent a summary he has given of the government's budget insofar as it relates to education! He had nothing to say about it, as the first government speaker following the Assistant Minister <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;&#xD;&#xA;    color:#222222;&#xD;&#xA;  text-decoration:none underline;">for Vocational Education and Skills</span>. I wish her the best of luck in responding to those questions and particularly in addressing them to the budget, which, no doubt, she's very proud to speak to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistant minister opened her contributions by saying that the government is absolutely committed to high-quality education outcomes and value for money. Well, this is a government that has shown in this budget that it has no priority for education, whether it's for early years, for universities—as my friend the member for Griffith will touch upon—for schools or for TAFE on what is, today, National TAFE Day. What the education components of this budget do is bake in inequality. A government that spoke stridently and deeply inaccurately about aspiration in question time is denying millions of Australians the opportunity for social mobility and personal development, which should be the cornerstone of education at every level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very disappointing. I have the greatest respect for the assistant minister. I think she should be a minister, but the fact remains she is not, and the minister who is responsible has not seen fit to come here. I'm very disappointed, for a few reasons. One thing the Minister representing the Minister for Education and Training has done is show that he is actually capable, from time to time, of engaging in cooperative federalism. Whether he can convince his party room of the merits of that, I don't know—in fact, I'm pessimistic. But that's the opposite of how this government has dealt with school education. It has shown an attitude that can only be described as uncooperative federalism. I'd be interested in how the assistant minister can inform me and constituents, particularly in Tasmania, the Northern Territory and South Australia, how the proposals which are baked in in legislation and evidenced in this budget will enable students in public schools in those states and that territory to ever reach the schooling resource standard, which is, of course, the cornerstone of the Gonski funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly talk also about early years, because unfortunately the member for Kingston, the shadow minister, can't be here. Only a few days remain before unfair changes to child care and early years—and I was pleased to hear the assistant minister talk about early years as well as child care. I congratulate her for that. I wish her colleagues, including the Prime Minister, would do the same. But the fact remains that this budget does not acknowledge the benefits of early-years education. We see again only a one-year bandaid when it comes to kindergarten program funding. We see some real problems: 297,000 families will be worse off under these unfair changes. I wonder, in addition to recognising that and then explaining that, can the minister provide an update on the government's readiness for the 2 July rollout of the childcare package? Has all performance testing of the new IT system been completed? Are all 16 software vendors registered? What percentage of centres and providers have registered for the new system? What percentage of families, critically, have registered for the new system, and is this percentage in line with the government's expected registrations? How many families did you, Assistant Minister, plan to have registered at this point?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder also if the minister could deal with deep concerns I have about schools. These concerns go to the question of appropriate funding for students with disability. If disability is a priority, can the minister explain why in the recent report handed down by David Gonski and received by government there is not a single reference to students with disability? It seems to me that that is an omission that needs to be remedied. As the shadow minister made clear, it could be remedied were there an evidence institute as recommended by Mr Gonski and supported and promised to be funded by Labor. But what we have from this government is a mess when it comes to funding for students with disabilities. We have inconsistent advice to government on the NCCD data process. We have inconsistencies and no apparent interest in progressing this. We had in November a statement by the minister advertising that the School Resourcing Board would look at the disability loading in November, but there has been not a single statement by the minister or the board in advancing that. So perhaps the assistant minister can tell us and parents of students with disabilities how this will be rectified.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I will focus on the National Innovation and Science Agenda and how this year's budget has built on those initiatives. Obviously, there's fairly uniform support for a dynamic 21st century Australia. My colleague the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Training and I have done consecutive reports on whether Australia is well prepared in school, university and the employment sector itself to take advantage of our geographic position. We're basically in the same time zone as half of the world's middle class. The opportunities for Australia have never been greater as the geopolitics have moved into our neck of the woods. But, increasingly, we hear reports about school standards and reports about poor levels of collaboration between industry and the tertiary education sector, and these really threaten the obvious opportunities that lie ahead for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the access to the global economy right now, people are concerned that Australians are not getting the education they need to move into work and that we're overly reliant on 457 visas and other solutions to meet those gaps. Both parties would have strong views about Australians being trained first for these highly skilled tasks. There's plenty of evidence around that says that the workforce is changing and everyone is going to be moving into higher tech jobs and that the jobs we all know of today won't exist in 20 years time. I'm not quite so bearish about that. I don't think we have to be so nihilistic as to think that jobs are going to vanish, but what will absolutely happen in the working careers of Australians leaving school now is that there will be not only way more stages in their career but a constant need to be able to adapt to the needs of innovation, tech, maths and STEM in whatever job they're doing. This is not just simply an argument, as the assistant minister would agree, about whether we can reshape TAFE, whether universities offer sufficient STEM emphasis or whether we can have enough workplace based learning so that universities have one foot in industry, but it's about having the agility in nearly every field of study to make sure we're ready for what's coming, be it automation or higher levels of STEM. There is going to have to be an extra arrow in the quiver, so to speak, to make sure that we're ready for those changes and that we can forecast them in advance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses, universities, research organisations, even CSIRO: the best in the world are fully capable of taking on these big questions, but we need to make sure that at a government level we're prepared to be an exemplar of it. Those areas that were identified back in late 2015, when the National Innovation and Science Agenda was formulated, are the areas that it's appropriate now, two or three years on, to be making sure that we're making progress in. We note already in Australia, as I referred to before, less connection between industry and tertiary education. There's some doubt about the quality of that data and whether areas like advertising and marketing are included or not overseas, as we do include them in Australian data. But, that set aside, we do know that in Australia there is a significant valley of death for early start-ups to move to a position where they have sufficient capital to take on the world. It's possibly the less risk-taking culture that we see in Australia that does remain a challenge for start-ups, even in our capital cities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That investment of $1.1 billion back in late 2015, over four years, to incentivise innovation and entrepreneurship may not have been what everyone talked about at the water cooler, but we know it's the long-term decision that we have to get right if the next generation looks back and questions what we did to prepare for changes that were coming. Those four areas, culture and capital, embracing risk, incentivising, early stage investment in start-ups, convincing our massive SME sector to contemplate the possibility of partnering up with a university—actively asking the questions about how they can be helped by tertiary education and not just sitting there with folded arms expecting universities to go out and find every SME in the country and ask how they can help. It is about collaboration, particularly with the research sector, actively setting aside a component of their budget to make sure that they can operationalise and commercialise great research, and bringing together research that happens even within the same tertiary campuses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, government is obviously an exemplar, leading by example and showing that we can manage data and transform data into useable information for the population. These are all objectives that I think are noble and would be supported on both sides. So my question to the assistant minister is: how has this year's budget continued to build on the government's National Innovation and Science Agenda? </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  It's 'World TAFE Day' today—I think it's Australian TAFE Day, but I have to elevate it to 'World TAFE Day'—as you are all well aware and you are, of course, Mr Deputy Speaker. On a day on which we recognise the importance of TAFE, I think it's useful to pick up a few of the points that the member for Bowman just made. He talked about the importance of training people in preference to temporary skilled migration. But there have been occupations on the skills list for longer than it would have taken to train people up in those occupations to remove the need to rely on temporary skilled migration. Bricklayers are the obvious, classic example. Bricklayer has been on that temporary skilled migration skills list longer than it takes to train bricklayers. It's absolutely ridiculous that in this country we have so failed to properly invest in vocational education that we have got occupations on the skills list that have been there for years that could have been trained up domestically. It's not a coincidence, because of course this government has no real interest in investing in vocational education and skills. This is a government that's cut $3 billion from vocational education and skills. At the same time, unfortunately, in this budget that includes $270 million in new cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very, very stark contrast to Labor's approach to vocational education. We want to see more apprenticeships. There are 140,000 fewer apprenticeships today than when the coalition took office back in 2013. We want to see that trend reversed. We're going to do it in a few ways. We're going to make sure there are opportunities for apprentices through procurement practices that require that one in 10 people working on government funded contracts be apprentices, for example. We also want to invest in vocational education. That starts with public TAFE. It starts with renewing and refreshing the equipment and facilities of public TAFEs. We want to make sure people have the opportunity to go to TAFE. We have committed to covering the up-front fees for 100,000 new TAFE students should we win government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question on TAFE is: what is the government going to do to make sure that those occupations come off the skills list by actually training people up so that we can have home-grown bricklayers, rather than having bricklayers coming in on 457 visas? My next question on TAFE is: will the government commit to stop making cuts to vocational education in this country and commit to properly funding vocational education with publicly funded TAFE to be at the forefront of that commitment? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, you would also be aware that this government, in the MYEFO announced on 18 December or thereabouts, cut around $2.2 billion from higher education. The government did that by basically implementing a university funding freeze to cap funding for the number of places for 2017 for the demand driven system so that there wouldn't be an increase in 2018 or 2019. Universities Australia estimated that that was about 9,500 places that that would be equivalent to in 2018. Universities have, of course, tried to absorb these massive funding cuts. I met with one university just this morning who told me—apropos of the member for Bowman's comments about the importance of the National Innovation and Science Agenda—that one of the ways they'd coped with the cuts was to cut courses in relation to improving teachers' ability to teach science. This is what universities are being forced to do. They're being forced to either not offer places that they'd previously offered for 2018 or, to avoid welshing on the commitments they'd made to prospective students, find other ways to make cuts to accommodate the massive funding cuts that this government imposed in MYEFO at the end of last year and baked into the budget in May this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to know whether the government will relent and lift its freeze on funding, and whether the government has any intention of ensuring that the freeze has some way of taking into account inflation. I'd like the assistant minister to confirm that the freeze means that a university cannot receive more dollars in 2018 or in 2019 than it did in 2017 for places funded under the demand driven system, the non-designated CGS places. I'd like the government to advise the year in which the freeze will end. This is a matter of crucial importance, not only to universities but to future prospective students and their families. I'd also like the assistant minister to advise exactly how the performance measures that were announced at the same time as MYEFO are going to work, and what additional funding will be available to pay universities in respect of those performance measures, and how those performance measures will be assessed in respect of university funding.</span>

Firstly, with respect to students with a disability, the government will invest an estimated $22.1 billion for students with disability over 2018 to 2027. On average, funding for students with disability will grow by 5.7 per cent each year over this period. In relation to child care, can I say that the transition to the new childcare package is well and truly under way. More than 850,000 families have now transitioned to the new system, and around 95 per cent of services have transitioned. The Turnbull government's sweeping reforms to child care are set to put money back in the pockets of working Australians. We can see this and the benefits of this—</span>

I indicated that there were more than 850,000 families who had transitioned to the new system. It's actually more than 900,000, so it is still above the 850,000 but is now over 900,000.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see the benefits of this package across the country: in South Australia, more than 61,000 families will benefit, including more than 4,700 families in Mayo; more than 17,700 families in Tasmania will benefit, including more than 3,100 families in the electorate of Braddon; and in Queensland, nearly 200,000 families will benefit, including more than 7,100 families in Longman. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, these are significant reforms that the Turnbull government is introducing, and ones that are fair and will, clearly, lead to greater prosperity in our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of comments made with respect to vocational education and training. I would like to put on the record some very relevant information about what the Turnbull government has done and will continue to do in the vocational education space. In the budget, we announced the Skilling Australians Fund. That Skilling Australians Fund will result in about 300,000 additional apprentices coming into the workforce. That comprises pre-apprenticeships, apprenticeships, and the higher apprenticeships, which are effectively at the associate diploma and diploma levels and are specifically designed to deal with the skills needs in the spaces that are emerging into the future in the advanced manufacturing space and the IT and finance sectors. So we as a government are looking at making sure that we are addressing our skills needs into the future. We have been very clear in the design of the Skilling Australians Fund that we are focusing on the priority skills needs areas for the future. Those include areas such as hospitality, tourism, health, ageing, the disability sector, manufacturing, and agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we need to train for specific areas in the future. We are partnering with the states and territories to make sure that, collectively, we meet those needs. We have said to the states that we want to work with them to develop the projects that are going to change this space—and it's a space where change is very much needed. We need to make sure that we are addressing those skills shortages. We have put up a proposal in two parts, and I do intend to talk in more detail about that later. But at this stage, it is sufficient to say that we have partnered with five states and territories for the new Skilling Australians Fund National Partnership Agreement that commences on 1 July and runs for four years.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government have now had five years where their attention to detail in education has been next to zero. Other than knowing what education should cost, but not understanding the value of it, there's very little that they can give us in the detail around what their cuts mean. If we remember what the original Gonski review suggested and then think about the reform that was put in place, it was based around a student resource standard. That was a base in schools education that was said to be the minimum requirement for Australian schools to meet the standards that we expect of them. Then there were layers around disadvantage that would have gone above that student resource standard. What we know from this budget and what we know from the Turnbull government is that very few state schools in this country will meet the student resource standard. Families are now confronted with the fact that this has been capped for state schools at 20 per cent of a contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wanted to talk a lot about 'special deals', as I think the term was. How are those individual special deals going with each of the states and independent sectors, and the Catholic systemic sectors, and at what point will schools reach the student resource standard? I think that's a fairly reasonable question. What does it mean for equity measures when state schools are to be capped at 20 per cent? Is the federal government therefore abandoning equity measures altogether? Are we going to be putting in place the equity funding that would mean it doesn't matter which school your child goes to or which postcode they live in; they would have an equal chance at a quality education? And when will the state schools in Victoria—and my electorate—reach their student resource standard? None of them have as yet. And how long will it take the state government to make up the difference, given that that's now going to be capped at 20 per cent from a Commonwealth contribution? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to make this point. It is not surprising at all that this government, in five years, have done nothing but reverse what was going to be the biggest reform that this country had seen in schools education. What they've put in place is almost a replication of the Howard era school-funding model, except there's probably a little bit more money in it because the population's bigger. They've also taken the opportunity to ensure that the independent sector will get 80 per cent of its student resource standard funded by the Commonwealth. This is absolutely outrageous. It can't possibly be determined that this has anything to do with needs based funding or with a system that's supposed to be sector blind. They're basically my questions. Other than that, what will it mean in the Catholic systemic system, and what will it mean to the family contributions or fees over the next two years for families attending Catholic schools in my electorate? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go too to some of the things that were said today in question time as they relate to the budget. The Prime Minister said today in question time that we all need to be aspirational. The Prime Minister suggested a 60-year-old aged-care worker should get themselves a better job. On this side, we understand that getting a better job might require you to retrain, go to TAFE. The cuts that have occurred mean this is less likely. The cuts to university mean it is less likely that the 60-year-old might be able to aspire to get a better job. I would ask the assistant minister if she agrees with me that perhaps the 60-year-old childcare worker would be better to vote Labor and get themselves a better Prime Minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to ask the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, who is representing the Minister for Education and Training, a question on this very important matter. I'm glad to say that relief is on its way for families in my electorate of Robertson who struggle with the cost of child care. In just under two weeks the Turnbull government will implement the biggest reform to child care in 40 years. Across the country nearly one million families are set to benefit from our new childcare package. In my electorate, over 6,500 families on the Central Coast will be better off, with support targeted to those who work the most and who earn the least. There are a lot of different pressures faced by families, and this action will overhaul a broken childcare system to deliver affordable, accessible and flexible services for families and children. Families in my electorate need to be able to make decisions about their work and family with certainty. I know that this package is going to deliver just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this potentially means for families across the Central Coast is that they might be able to take on an extra day or an extra shift or they might be able to volunteer more of their time with the certainty that their childcare needs will be properly supported. Eighty-five per cent of families using child care will no longer be subject to the dreaded annual childcare rebate cap, meaning that they can work as many days as they choose without exceeding their subsidy. Higher income families will see their annual cap increase to just over $10,000. We're also increasing the subsidy rate from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent, benefiting around 370,000 families earning less than $67,000. The new system kicks in on 2 July, and family budgets are set to be around $1,333 a year better off per child on average. We estimate that this package will encourage more than 230,000 Australian families to increase their workforce participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to note that our $1.2 billion childcare safety net is designed to support those who are not able to work due to health or other significant challenges. In addition to our childcare package, the coalition government's Early Learning Language Australia, Early Learning STEM Australia, Little Scientists and Let's Count programs are supporting our littlest learners. Recently, I invited the minister for education to visit my electorate on the Central Coast to tour Kindy Patch in West Gosford. It's a long day care centre that's taking part in the ELLA program and teaching it's young students Spanish. In fact, around 600 young students are taking place in the program at 20 preschools across my electorate. Programs like ELLA complement the coalition government's $870 million investment in preschools over 2018 and 2019. Around 2,000 preschoolers in my electorate will benefit from $2.5 million of that support from next year. Many families across the Central Coast will be hundreds if not thousands of dollars a year better off under our reforms, but they do need to make the switch to the new system. I'm pleased to be advised that already around 75 per cent of families have completed their online form to transition to the new system. I think that's outstanding. With two weeks to go, it's important that all families complete the online form to make the switch. I know how busy these families are, so I'm pleased that already so many have taken the time to switch over to the new package. I'd also like to pay tribute to the outstanding early learning services in my electorate for supporting these families in their transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising that this is the biggest reform in child care for 40 years, can the minister please update the chamber on the progress of implementation of the coalition government's new childcare package commencing in just under two weeks, on 2 July?</span>

On a related front, will the assistant minister also commit to going back to the minister and having a pretty firm word with him about the fact that universal access funding for kindergartens has not been committed beyond the end of 2019?</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistant minister is, I'm sure, aware of the uncertainty that this leaves early learning centres and community run kindergartens in. I certainly have kindies in my area. We all do. I visit my kindies on a regular basis, and they're very concerned about the fact they don't have funding certainty beyond the end of 2019. I'm pretty surprised, to be honest. Every year, I think this is going to be the year that the Liberals finally see sense and give a five-year funding commitment for universal access funding for kindies and preschools. Every year, I think this is going to happen. But no, it's always a one-year extension. This is not good enough. You know the importance of preschool and kindy.</span>

                  </a>  Don't make excuses, Member for Forde. The member for Forde is making excuses for why you cannot fund early learning in this country. You go back to your electorate and tell all the parents in your electorate why you can't commit to universal access for kindy funding beyond the end of 2019. It's a question about funding. Maybe tell them why you're choosing to spend $80 billion on corporate tax handouts for the big end of town rather than to fund early learning and rather than to fund specifically the universal access funding for kindies that parents are going to rely on. Explain to them why the priority should be helping out your mates at the top end of town and not helping out the families in your electorate. I'd love to hear that conversation; I don't think it's going to go very well for you, frankly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I asked the minister some questions previously, I did ask about the MYEFO cuts to university funding—the $2.2 billion in cuts. I didn't really get much of an answer. Obviously, the assistant minister had other questions that she had to answer in the course of her earlier response, and they were important questions. But perhaps the assistant minister could give some thought to those $2.2 billion in cuts announced in December last year and baked into the budget in May this year, because, as I said earlier, Universities Australia calculated that that would mean about 9½ thousand places in 2018. It'll mean something similar in 2019. Of course, these cuts were announced in December, weren't they? By then, a lot of the universities had already made their offers for 2018. Most of them didn't renege on those and say, 'Actually, sorry, you can't have that place at uni that we told you you could have.' They had to find other ways to absorb the cuts, didn't they? I was saying before when a different Deputy Speaker was in the chair that I spoke to a university just this morning who said that they'd absorbed the funding cuts by cutting courses. That's not really a shock. It's what they had to do. They cut some courses. They cut some psychology courses, which I thought was particularly disappointing—courses that had been created to help teachers skill up in teaching science. I raise that specifically because the member for Bowman came in before and asked some questions about the National Innovation and Science Agenda. Cutting $2.2 billion from university funding is not really consistent with a commitment to the National Innovation and Science Agenda. It's pretty inconsistent with a commitment to that agenda. It's pretty inconsistent with a commitment to families. It's pretty inconsistent with a commitment to young people who are looking to the future and trying to work out what skills they will need for the jobs of the future. It's pretty inconsistent with a commitment to mature-aged people who are thinking about reskilling, retraining and getting better qualifications so that they can, as the Prime Minister today suggested, get a better job. And it's pretty inconsistent with a government wanting to do the best for the Australian economy, because, when you fund higher education, you're not just funding something that, together with international tourism, is our most important service export. You're funding something that makes a massive contribution to our economy domestically, because, of course, education is not just great for dealing with inequality, for helping with social mobility and for helping people to get ahead regardless of the circumstances of their birth. It's also great for making our future workforce and our current workforce more productive. It's great for making our firms more productive. It's great for the research that is done that also contributes to the Australian economy. So I ask the assistant minister to explain what will be done to reverse the impact of these terrible MYEFO cuts from last year.</span>

                  </a>  Would I be welcome there? Absolutely. Would I be happy to go there? Absolutely. I'd also be very happy to go to those electorates—and, in fact, to every electorate in Australia—and talk to them about vocational education. We've heard the opposition speak endlessly about what they claim to be cuts. Let me talk to you a little bit about what damage the opposition did to vocational education. They are at the point now of trying to make a virtue of fixing the damages that they inflicted on the sector. And I'm not going to let them get away with that, not at all. There were some significant declines in the numbers of apprentices in this country and they happened during Labor's last year in government. In 2012-13, we experienced in this country the single biggest decline in apprenticeship numbers. Twenty-two per cent or 110,000 apprentices were lost to this country, because Labor cut the employer incentive to take on an apprentice. They didn't just do it once, twice or three times—they actually did nine successive cuts. Labor took a total of $1.2 billion out of VET funding, out of apprenticeships, and they did, literally, bring the sector to its knees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also negotiated an agreement with the states, a national partnership agreement from 2012 to 2017. It was $1.75 billion worth of funding—$1.15 billion of that money went to structural reform in the sector; only $600 million went to training outcomes. Over the last four years, we have lived with the damage that Labor inflicted to the VET sector. However, the Turnbull government has successfully negotiated an agreement with the majority of states and territories, covering the majority of the population in this country, to make sure that we will get some outcomes in the sector. We have partnered with the states. We will be developing projects that will have key milestones, and payments based on those milestones, and we will be looking at absolute outcomes to increase the number of apprentices that we have in training—at the pre-apprenticeship level, so that we're starting the pipeline; at the apprenticeship level, where we know we have some significant shortfalls in apprenticeship numbers; and also at the higher apprenticeship level, where we know we have an emerging sector. I said right at the beginning that we see education as a highway, and we do. Vocational education is part of that highway, and it is a critical part of that highway for our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am on the record as saying that universities have been extraordinarily successful in building and selling the dream of what a university degree can offer. And for many people, that is a reality. I'm very supportive of the work that universities are doing, and there are many people who study at university and go on to very worthwhile, rewarding careers, and that's great. But there are many people out there who would be much better served if they followed a vocational education pathway. The government is committed to making sure that those people do not feel that they are second-class citizens and that they are given every opportunity to succeed in worthwhile, rewarding, fulfilling careers. We have put money on the table—$1.5 billion through the Skilling Australians Fund. We are supporting the Australian Apprenticeship Support Network to go out there and make sure that we are getting the right people into apprenticeships and matching them with the right employers. We are building a vocational education strategy so that we can make sure that we can attract those students in the latter years of their schooling to follow a vocational education pathway—because we know that we need their skills, and we know that they need a fulfilling job for the future, and we're planning to make sure they get it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  It's refreshing to hear a coalition person reflect on the value of a university education. It's great that the assistant minister thinks that education can—if it's a university education—sometimes lead to very worthwhile work. It's in particularly sharp contrast to the Prime Minister's conduct today in question time, when he used the word 'educated' to refer to Labor members as though it was an insult, and when he was claiming that we don't understand aspiration—which I thought was quite interesting. At the same time as he was saying that we were educated elites he was also claiming that we didn't understand aspiration. He was implying that education was somehow insulting to us at the same time as he was claiming people needed to develop their aspiration to get ahead in life. He can't have his cake and eat it too. Either he thinks it's great that Labor members have gone from a situation like mine, where my parents didn't go past grade 10 and I did get to go to university and to go into a great middle-class occupation, that of being a lawyer—either he thinks it's great to have that sort of aspiration and for people from working-class backgrounds to get to move into middle-class occupations and have social mobility in this country or he thinks it's an absolute travesty, but he can't have them both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He certainly can't claim that Labor members don't understand aspiration, because we exemplify aspiration. We have aspiration in our bones. It was Bob Hawke who thought about a fair chance for all, with the precursor to the HEPPP, the program that we now have today. There have been 25 years of programs aimed at getting equity into higher education participation. When you hear people like the assistant minister stand up and say, 'We just want the right sort of people at university and the right sort of people in vocational education,' unfortunately, sometimes that's just code for wanting middle-class kids at uni and working-class kids in vocational education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want a future where the poorest kid has as much opportunity to go to university as the richest kid, and where the richest kid has as much interest in going into vocational education as the poorest kid. I want to elevate the status of vocational education and elevate the opportunity to go into university. They are equally important—absolutely they are—but you don't get to just claim that if you're not going to fund public TAFE and vocational education properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the assistant minister is looking for ideas on how to do something about the fact that, under the coalition's watch, there are 140,000 fewer apprentices now than when they took office in 2013 and that there has been a 40 per cent reduction in the number of apprentices in my electorate, she should look no further than the fact that, as well as being able to influence vocational education and opportunities for apprentices through regulation, legislation and government programs, government can also have an impact through its role as a purchaser of services, through procurement. Government could quite easily say that it is a condition of doing business with government that, for example, one in 10 people working on a government civil construction project must be apprentices. In fact, we know it's possible because it's our policy. Bill announced this more than a year ago. In his first major speech last year, the Leader of the Opposition announced that Labor's policy would be to make sure that there is primacy of publicly funded TAFE and to make sure that there are opportunities for apprentices, including through procurement policies, that say one in 10 workers on a government funded procurement project would have to be apprentices. Will the assistant minister take up Labor's policy of ensuring that one in 10 workers on government procured projects are apprentices? Will the assistant minister do that with a view to using government procurement as a force for better training outcomes and better training participation in this country?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This party is not a party that's in any way above using procurement and funding mechanisms. If you want an example of that, look no further than the Building Code, the Building Code that the Australian Building and Construction Commission enforced and, before it, the Building Industry Taskforce had an interest in. That code set conditions for workplace relations arrangements as a condition of getting government work. They've used procurement before. In fact, they did the same in universities. Remember the higher-education workplace relations requirements, the HEWRRs, they used to try to force academics off collective agreements and onto individual contracts? It was a very long time ago. This government is led by the Liberals, of course, who have got form in using procurement for, I would say, quite nefarious purposes. Will the government now consider using procurement for the forces of good?</span>

I always admire the contributions from those opposite, because they actually never provide any useful solutions to the problems that are before us. It's just a culture of whingeing and complaining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was interesting listening to the assistant minister's earlier answer. I want to thank the assistant minister for her ability to be across such a broad portfolio when there are so many things going on. It just shows again that as a government we're paying attention to detail. The assistant minister's door is always open for a discussion about a range of issues, and I'm very appreciative. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to focus on a couple of things. There is, firstly, education funding. I can say that, across the 42 schools in my electorate, I've had the pleasure of catching up with the principals over the course of this year. They're all happy. They're all happy with the funding that they are receiving and the resources that their schools are getting. Despite the complaints and misinformation and campaigns from those opposite, and from the Australian Education Union and others, the fact of the matter is that the principals and staff in the schools in my electorate of Forde are more than happy with the funding they are receiving from this government and they are going to receive in the years going forward. So my congratulations go to the Minister for Education and his representative, the assistant minister here today, on that. I know they've both been to the electorate at various times to listen to the concerns of the education sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch on the program that we continue to roll out around Early Learning Languages Australia, otherwise known as the ELLA program. I had the pleasure in 2015 of attending the opening of that program at the Logan TAFE Community Child Care Centre. From memory, I think they were doing Arabic. That program is tremendous because it gives the kids an opportunity to learn a second language. We know from any number of studies that when kids are exposed to other languages and skills it helps them in their day-to-day learning. I'm also very happy to say that recently we announced that, in the second round of funding for the ELLA program, the Bethania Early Education Centre was successful in getting funding for its program. They are focusing on Mandarin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both of these centres are in areas we classify as low-socioeconomic areas, particularly the early learning centre. The opportunity for these kids at these early learning centres to learn this second language and use that as a foundation for their learning and building their skills and their capacity as students is enormous. We know that each and every one of these children is valuable and important and has tremendous skills and capability, and we need to create the opportunities for them to demonstrate that. We also see schools with kids in music programs. Typically, the kids in music programs are some of the top students in our schools.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, I'm pleased with the budget announcement and the changes we've made in childcare funding. There are some 8,900 families across my electorate, and their children will benefit from the increased funding we're making to the childcare sector. That has been very well received. It is just another example of what this government is doing across the spectrum of education. And I haven't touched on vocational education. I think vocational education is tremendously important. We need carpenters and plumbers and electricians, because the average age of that workforce today is the mid-50s. We need a new generation to come through. Could the minister please explain how these programs are helping across our electorates and particularly in mine of Forde?</span>

The first one is about the take-up rate of people embracing the changes in the childcare sector. I have a concern about the information message getting out to people. I do see government advertisements at the moment, but they're not on that particular change—unless I'm looking at the wrong TV advertisements, not that I see much TV. I'd be interested to know what the take-up rate is now. The 1st of July is coming very rapidly, and I'm concerned that people are going to get ambushed by that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next question is more to do with high school and primary education, particularly primary education, and the theme of question time today to do with aspiration. In my former life, after high school, I started as a high school teacher. I taught English for 11 years. Since then, I've always seen education as the great opportunity in life. I was the first person in my family, a family of 10 children, to get a university degree. Because of that, and the opportunity that came with education, I've always seen lives change by investing in education. We know the productivity gains that are there. We know that when we had a focus on what was wrong with our education system, or what we could do better, we had recommendations, and the expert panel said to look at needs based education funding that was sector blind. Irrespective of what the sign was over the gate of the school—whether it was a Christian school, a Catholic school, a state school, a grammar school, a private Aboriginal school like the Murray School in my electorate—what could we do that would improve the chances in life for those children? It was sector blind, needs based education funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a particular concern about the flow-on of funds coming from the Turnbull government decision to move away from sector blind, needs based education funding. I don't know about the Gold Coast, but I'm particularly concerned about some of the inner-city poor Catholic schools, as a good example. In my electorate that would be St Brendon's, Our Lady of Fatima, and even St Thomas More, the high school, to a certain extent. These are the sorts of schools that are taking battlers and that don't have a great fee base. In fact, the Catholic education system, because of their mission, are often carrying a lot of parents and not receiving any fees from some of those parents—not just in places like Palm Island, Thursday Island and Cunnamulla and some of those more remote parts of the Catholic education system, but even, as I've said, in schools like St Brendon's in Moorooka and Our Lady of Fatima in Acacia Ridge. They're doing it tough without a big fee base, and I think they're going to be particularly hit by the changes in education funding as it rolls out. I know there's been a bit of agitation about it. I think there are some articles in the papers today about this. I think there are also some Christian schools—some of those poorer Christian schools. Brisbane Christian College in my electorate is not quite in that category, but I think there'd be a few on the northern part of the Gold Coast that would be the new struggling Christian schools that don't have the systemic support. I think they're going to be hit significantly by these changes in education funding. I know Queensland education more than the other states, but I'm sure there'd be learnings from other states. I'd ask the minister if she could report back on how these schools have indicated they're prepared to accommodate these changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland Catholic Education Commission has a role for administering Commonwealth funds. The basic plan is that the Commonwealth gives them the money and they distribute it across the diocese so that, basically, some of the wealthier Catholic parents are supporting some of the poorer Catholic parents. It's not really in their prospectus, but it's the sort of thing that the Queensland Catholic Education Commission could talk to you about. I suggest you talk to Lee-Anne Perry, the head of the Queensland Catholic Education Commission. She used to be the principal of All Hallow's, an inner-city school that certainly had some wealthier parents but also had a few battlers. I should declare that it's my mother's former school. Lee-Anne Perry would be good to talk to about how they're getting ready for this change in funding, and I'd like you to report back to the parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Jobs are underpinned by Australian workers whose skills meet industry needs and we have a focus on apprenticeships, education and training, giving people the best opportunity to reach their dreams and indeed their aspirations. Those opposite are mystified by aspiration, confounded by aspiration, puzzled by aspiration and bamboozled by aspiration. But we know these skills are necessary, particularly for the people in my electorate of Dunkley. I want to mention the fact that I went to see students ranging from years 9 to 12 at the federally funded, $18.5 million, Chisholm Trade Training Centre in Frankston, who are trying to achieve their life aspirations through carpentry, cooking, plumbing, engineering and more. It is these people I've had the privilege to work with over a long period of time who want to reach their aspirations and achieve their dreams. The coalition, via the minister, is helping them to their dreams, whether it's that or via the apprenticeships drive we did last year, which saw in Frankston and the peninsula a 31 per cent increase in local apprenticeships. </span>
