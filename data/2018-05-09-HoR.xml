I wish to advise the House that His Excellency the Governor-General wrote to Her Majesty noting the anniversary and drawing Her Majesty's attention to the program of events to be held this year to mark the occasion. We have received the following message in reply from Her Majesty from Buckingham Palace:</span>

All Australians are very proud of what we've managed to achieve here physically in this building but also in our democracy over the last 117 years. This is the most visited building of all buildings in Australia, even more than the Sydney Opera House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a tremendous program that brings schoolchildren here, which successive governments have supported in a bipartisan way. I have to say that, when I return to my electorate and talk to children who've been to the parliament, they have a lot to say about our parliament, our democracy and our system of government. They're very proud of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say that I actually did work in Old Parliament House over 30 years ago. I worked for Amanda Vanstone in Old Parliament House on the Senate side in the 1980s, and I came here as part of the new parliament. There are significant differences between the old parliament and this parliament. The old parliament was very, very small, but it meant that you were very close to people on all sides of the House. But it was not functional as a building. This building is very functional and much better for government and much better for a democracy of the sophistication and stature of ours, but it's not quite as intimate. So there are swings and roundabouts. I think, on balance, it's a much better parliament than the old one, and I'm very pleased that the Fraser government commissioned it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:34</span>):  On indulgence, I join with the Leader of the House in expressing thanks for the message. Thirty years—it's extraordinary when we think about it. I myself have been here for just under half that time; you yourself, Mr Speaker, for just more than half of that time; and the Leader of the House for almost every day of that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that time, I think it's fair to say the House has served us very well. There have been some changes in that time. Thirty years ago we never began parliament, as you just did, with an acknowledgement of country. I think it's fair to say that all of us are disappointed that events over the years have forced security arrangements, which means that the original design—where people could just freely walk all over the building—isn't available in the same way these days. We understand why, but the principle of having a parliament that the people could walk on top of is still there. It's a wonderful part of the design of this building, and the principle, going all the way back to traditional beliefs in this land, that the law of Australia would rest within the land is something that is in this very special piece of architecture here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was there at the final sitting of the Senate as well, as a uni student, watching Rosemary Crowley and Robert Hill, I think it was, dance on the table as streamers flew and the Usher of the Black Rod looked very unhappy. As I look back on it now, being there was an odd thing to do as a teenager. But, certainly, Mr Speaker, I think your stewardship has been a very important part of this House as it has continued to develop. The traditions we have will continue to develop, and all the work that has been done on this building means that it will, hopefully, continue to serve the people in the way it was originally intended to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements the Turnbull government's Personal Income Tax Plan to make personal income taxes lower, simpler and fairer. It's about providing tax relief for working Australians, particularly those on middle to low incomes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By sticking to our plan for a stronger economy, the government is returning the budget to balance and to surplus and guaranteeing the essentials that Australians rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And because a stronger economy delivers more revenue to the budget we are able to responsibly afford the Personal Income Tax Plan for tax relief for working Australians that is presented in this bill. It is affordable. It is fiscally responsible. More so it is necessary and will help people to manage the household budget pressures that they face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to a tax system that rewards effort and aspiration and promotes opportunity; a tax system that is internationally competitive, capable of driving stronger investment and stronger growth for our economy and, above all, a stronger economy, upon which everything depends; a tax system where all individuals and businesses pay their fair share so the government can deliver essential services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without action, the personal income tax system will increasingly penalise Australians for earning more as they move into higher tax brackets. The tax burden borne by workers will rise, reducing the rewards for effort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As outlined in the Australian Taxation Office taxation statistics, the personal income tax burden is carried by the few, not the many. In 2015-16, the top one per cent of taxpayers paid around 17 per cent of the $186 billion tax bill for personal income tax. The top 10 per cent paid around 45 per cent of this total, compared with around 36 per cent 20 years earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has set up a tax-to-GDP speed limit of 23.9 per cent of the economy. This prudent fiscal strategy ensures that taxes do not chase spending and overwhelm the economy and have the bizarre situation where it's like a snake eating itself from the tail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the seven years of this plan, the government will provide tax relief to encourage and reward hardworking Australians and to reduce household budget pressures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan will mean that individuals will be able to take on additional work, seek advancement and put the extra hours in, knowing that their extra income and their extra hard work will remain with them and that a higher proportion will not go to the government in higher taxes. Our plan will deliver a personal income tax system that is lower, fairer and simpler, consistent with Liberal-National values.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">(3) It will ensure Australians pay less tax, by making personal taxes simpler and flatter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our personal income tax plan, 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers will pay no more than 32½ cents in the dollar on their marginal rate. This compares with 63 per cent if we leave the system unchanged and if we do not pass this bill now. That's why it must be passed now, because we are not going to set Australia on the rails, where 63 per cent of the population are paying a top marginal rate of 32½ cents in the dollar, when we can say 94 per cent of the Australian population should be able to understand that that is the tax system that they will be living in over the next decade. They need that encouragement and they need that certainty, and they can get it now. They can get it right now by supporting the full personal income tax plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Step 1 of our plan will start permanent tax relief to low- and middle-income earners first as a priority, helping to ease household budget pressures. A new non-refundable low- and middle-income tax offset will provide tax relief of up to $530 to middle- and lower-income earners for the 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 income years. This is what can be responsibly afforded, while keeping the budget on track. That's half a year's electricity bills paid for right there with the tax relief for middle- to low-income earners that is being delivered by the Turnbull government in this budget and in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new tax offset is in addition to the benefit lower-income earners receive from the low-income tax offset, and will be paid in the same way—on assessment after tax returns have been lodged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This tax relief will not be clawed back by other tax increases, including the Medicare levy, which will remain unchanged, nor will it be funded by putting a higher tax burden on others. That's not how you do it. You don't have to punish hardworking Australians to provide relief to other Australians; that's called the politics of envy, not the economics of opportunity that is understood and believed by this side of the House. The other side of the House simply wants to tax more Australians more, to take taxes as a share of the economy to records that even Whitlam in his wildest dreams could never have fantasised about. Tax fantasies will become a reality for the Labor Party if they ever occupy these benches again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Step 2 of the plan is necessary to be voted on and made certain now. It will help ensure that incomes earned by Australians are protected from bracket creep. From 1 July 2018, the government will increase the top threshold of the 32½ per cent tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000, providing a tax cut of up to $135 per year to around three million taxpayers. This builds on the 2016-17 budget increase to the top threshold of the 32½ per cent bracket from $80,000 to $87,000, and shows the Turnbull government's long-term commitment to reforming the personal income tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2022, the government will provide tax relief of up to $1,350 per year by further increasing the top threshold of the 32½ per cent bracket from $90,000 to $120,000. This is projected to benefit around 3.9 million taxpayers and prevent around 1.8 million taxpayers from facing the second-top marginal tax rate of 37 per cent in 2022-23.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the top threshold of the 19 per cent tax bracket will be increased from $37,000 to $41,000 providing a tax cut of up to $540 a year. The low-income tax offset will also be increased from $445 to $645. The extension of the 19 per cent tax bracket together with the increase to the low income tax offset will guarantee the benefits of step 1 are maintained on a permanent basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By protecting against bracket creep under step 2 of our plan it ensures that a pay rise, extra overtime or working more hours do not get eaten up by higher tax rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Step 3 of the plan will make the personal tax system simpler and flatter. From 1 July 2024, the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent tax bracket will be further increased from $120,000 to $200,000, abolishing the 37 per cent tax bracket altogether and reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four. This is projected to prevent around 1.8 million taxpayers from facing a tax rate higher than 32.5 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This plan provides certainty to most taxpayers, most of whom will face the same marginal tax rate through their working life. That means bracket creep will be history for the majority of working Australians under this plan to be delivered by a Turnbull government. It should be voted on by this parliament to give that certainty to those Australians right here, right now. Right here, right now is when Australians want certainty about being able to have tax relief—not just today but into the future. They need that certainty now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know those opposite will quibble. They'll take any excuse running to not provide tax relief to working Australians. They won't put a speed limit on their taxes and they'll be so mean to not ensure that Australians can have the certainty of tax relief both now and into the future. Any excuse to keep taxes high and to spend the economy into oblivion—that's what you'll get from the opposition time and time again. Any excuse will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan provides certainty to taxpayers. That's what it's delivering. The personal income tax plan contained in this bill—the whole deal—provides reward for effort. It provides fostering of aspiration in this country, improving incentives to strive for success. Permanent tax relief will put more of Australians' hard-earned income back into their pockets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">High-income earners will contribute to income taxes about the same way as they do now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The personal income tax plan is a package. We are legislating that whole package, that whole plan, that whole promise, that whole commitment, that certainty that families want about when they go to work for the next 10 years they will keep more of what they earn and they won't have the Labor Party or any government in the future putting their hands deep into their pockets and ripping out their hard-earned money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They can have that support, that certainty and that guarantee right now. We all know the history of the Labor Party on l-a-w. They know they can't be trusted. This government can be trusted though because we believe in lower taxes. We believe in them because we know it rewards effort and we know it drives a stronger economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill implements the low and middle income tax offset and increases the value of the low income tax offset. Schedule 2 of the bill increases the personal income tax thresholds in 2018-19, 2022-23 and 2024-25 delivering significant tax cuts to Australian taxpayers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the party of responsible budgets and lower taxes. This plan is affordable. It's funded in the budget; it's consistent with our fiscal rules; it's returning the budget to a balance of over one per cent of GDP over the medium term; and it's bringing us back to a balance in 2019-20 with surpluses building after that and, at the same time, keeping taxes under the speed limit, which is what taxpayers expect. Under the Labor Party, too much tax is never enough—it's never enough! The Liberal Party and the National Party know that too much tax is too much tax. It has to be restricted so Australians can be guaranteed and have the certainty of their encouragement through the tax system that is in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the party of responsible budgets. We are the party of lower taxes. There is a clear choice: higher taxes under the Labor Party that suffocate the economy or lower taxes under the Liberal-National Party that provide the stronger economy that guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on—Medicare and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Higher funding for schools and higher funding for hospitals are in the budget I delivered last night. That is all delivered by a stronger economy, which the Labor Party wants to suffocate with $220 billion of higher taxes and denying tax relief to hardworking Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of amendments which have come back from the Senate which the government has agreed to. Largely, these amendments go to things which we were planning on including in instruments, but which the Senate wanted to be included in legislation—in particular, the labour market testing provisions which, as everybody knows, we are very serious about incorporating as part of the reforms to what used to be called the 457 visas and which are now called the TSS visas, the temporary skill shortage visas. This is the primary visa to enable businesses to sponsor people into the country on a short-term basis. We wanted to ensure that there is very good labour market testing conducted first to give the opportunity for an Australian to accept the job before the business could sponsor a person from overseas into that position. The amendments go through some fairly rudimentary labour-market testing provisions—saying, for example, that the advertisement must be advertised for at least four weeks; that the advertisements must be at least four months prior to the position being requested; and also that the manner of the ads must be sufficient to give an Australian a good opportunity to know about it, to assess that particular job to see if they want it, and to apply for it. It's only if there is no Australian able to fulfil the particular job—having advertised for the position, done the right thing for the requisite amount of time—that the particular business can then sponsor a person into that position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a further amendment, which was requested by the Nick Xenophon Team, now known as Centre Alliance, to review the operation of the SAF levy after 18 months. That seems like a reasonable amendment, and so we have agreed to that amendment. Consequently, I hope that now the SAF bill, with these amendments, will pass the House and be enacted into law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can just reflect upon what this bill, the Migration Amendment (Skilling Australians Fund) Bill, does. In essence, it amends the Migration Act 1958 to provide for the collection of a nomination training contribution charge from employers nominating overseas skilled workers. The measure is a critical element of the government's employer-sponsored migration reforms, ensuring that Australian workers are given first priority for jobs in this country. The government is considering industry concerns regarding refunds of and exemptions from the nomination training contribution charges. The government, as I said, supports the amendments to the bill moved by the opposition regarding labour market testing, and by Centre Alliance regarding a review of the nomination training contribution charge 18 months after commencement. The administration of the Skilling Australians Fund will increase the transparency and accountability of training contributions made by employers utilising the skilled migration program. This will increase public confidence that the businesses that bring in skilled migrants are doing their part to help Australians prepare for the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important bill which is a continuation of our reforms to the skilled migration program, which included the abolition of the 457 visas. We were concerned that that wasn't always being used properly, and so we've introduced a new scheme, the short-term skills shortage scheme. That is in operation now and is going along well. We are finding that this is being utilised, but that there are skills shortages across the country as the labour market tightens. We're working with those businesses to ensure that where there's no Australian available, they can get a skilled migrant into those positions. I commend these amendments to the House and I look forward to the passage of this bill.</span>

We're pleased the government has been dragged kicking and screaming to these amendments, and we're pleased they've changed their mind in relation to this issue. We have always believed in genuine labour market testing for employers nominating overseas workers and we fought for it every step of the way, including across two days in this chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour market testing requires employers wanting to bring in overseas workers to test the local labour market first. This is to make sure there are no suitable qualified and experienced local workers readily available to fill those positions, prior to bringing in overseas workers. The Turnbull government did not legislate strict labour market testing in the original legislation, and that's why the debate took place across two days. Labor don't trust the government in relation to this issue—or their big-business budget—and we never have; that's why we moved amendments to protect local workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The successful amendments will ensure that labour market testing is advertised for a minimum of four weeks, has been conducted no more than four months before the nomination of a worker on a skilled visa and is targeted in a such a way that a significant portion of suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents would be likely to be informed about the position. They will ensure that there are not unrealistic and unwarranted skills and experience requirements for vacant positions with the effect of excluding otherwise suitable Australian applicants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government have failed to protect local workers in their getting the first shot at local jobs. Labor's strict labour-market-testing conditions will ensure that local workers get the first shot at these jobs. We're pleased the government have changed their position. We had to beat them 38-28 in the Senate, and we're pleased that they've accepted these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget confirms our long-held belief that the Turnbull government botched their skilled migration changes and that their reliance on visa levies is deeply flawed, with $270 million in cuts to the Skilling Australians Fund uncovered in the Turnbull government's big-business budget. That's the subject of the debate before the chamber today. The Turnbull government's mistakes have forced them to make further skilled migration changes in the budget, such as refund and exemption provisions, leaving $270 million less going towards skills and training of young and working-class Australians. Because of this unfair budget, big business gets an $80 billion handout while Australians miss out on essential skills and training that should last a lifetime and lead to real jobs with decent wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government even admit in the budget papers their failure to get their act together, by blaming delays in the passage of enabling legislation. They could have accepted our amendments a long time ago when we proposed them, but, reluctantly, stubbornly and obstinately, they refused to accept them, and finally today they have agreed. The budget proves that the Turnbull government's Skilling Australians Fund, their primary source of funding for apprenticeships and traineeships, is deeply flawed and insecure because of its reliance on visa levies from overseas workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor will guarantee funding for TAFE and skills regardless of the number of overseas workers coming to this country. We're pleased that the government have changed their position, and we're happy to support the amendments.</span>

However, we urge the government to expedite the establishment of the proposed National Radioactive Waste Management Facility (NRWMF) to alleviate the uncertainty over a final pathway for disposal of nuclear waste in this country. The committee is aware of the growing stockpile of radioactive waste across the country, not only from the ANSTO facility but from other sources. Although the need for the national waste facility may not appear pressing at the moment, there is some urgency, considering the past difficulties this project has encountered and possible future delays.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  It's 128 years since the 'Father of Federation', Sir Henry Parkes, delivered his famous speech in Tenterfield, which was seen as a landmark on the road to the creation of our nation. One of Parkes's compelling arguments for transforming a group of colonies into a single nation was the need for a standard rail gauge between states to facilitate the efficient movement of goods and military assets by rail. In the 21st century it remains important that we do all we can to facilitate efficiency in transport not only by rail but also by sea, air and road. We must not allow red tape to add complexity and expense to the process of moving freight around our nation. This is particularly important when it comes to road transport. That is why the former Labor government created the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator to administer regulation of heavy vehicles over 4.5 gross tonnes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the COAG agreeing to this landmark change in 2011 and the regulator's commencement in early 2013 there were six state and territory agencies involved in regulating heavy vehicles. This was inefficient. It meant that trucking companies needed to maintain squads of administrative staff to handle vast amounts of paperwork. Truck drivers would travel our road system carrying huge folders full of licences, permits and other forms. This added needless complexity to the system, but it also added costs that were inevitably passed on to the consumer. Thanks to the former Labor government's microeconomic reform, we now have one law covering vehicle standards; mass, dimension and loading requirements; fatigue management; accreditation; and on-road enforcement. The creation of this single set of regulations, administered by a single regulator, along with the creation of single regulators in the maritime and rail sectors, will boost our national income by some $30 billion over just two decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The harmonisation of transport regulation was the culmination of a process of regulatory reform commenced by the Labor government in 1991 with the establishment of the National Transport Commission. When I became the minister, in December 2007, one of the first briefings I had from the department outlined how this reform was stuck in bureaucratic wrangling between the Commonwealth and the states and had not been advanced during the period of the Howard government. We had four ministerial council meetings over a series of months to make sure that we got agreement across the board for the national transport regulators. The fact is that Western Australia and the Northern Territory are unfortunately not participating in this national system at this point, but the rest of the states and territories came on board because they understood that these changes would make a real difference to our national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of the national regulator is the key reason the Interstate Road Transport Legislation (Repeal) Bill is before us today. Back in 1987, the Hawke Labor government created the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme, or FIRS, a voluntary alternative to the bewildering array of state and territory regulations still in existence at that time. The FIRS also applied to all heavy vehicles over 4.5 gross tonnes and established uniform charges and operating conditions for interstate heavy vehicle operators. Labor created FIRS in response to industry concerns that interstate road transport rules were restricting their business. Vehicles that operate under FIRS are required to comply with Australian design rules and other standard requirements regarding vehicle equipment and performance standards. They must also have third-party insurance. The state and territory governments administer the FIRS on behalf of the federal government, and registration charges are redistributed amongst the states to be spent on road maintenance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FIRS was also designed to promote road safety. Participants are exempt from standard state and territory stamp duties on newly purchased vehicles to encourage them to use newer high-productivity vehicles. This is good for our economy. Importantly, though, it is good for road safety, because the newer the vehicle the better the design standards, and it's also good for the environment because newer vehicles produce fewer emissions and less pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today creates a process to abolish FIRS. It would amend the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. The bill closes FIRS to new entrants and re-registration from 1 July 2018. It allows the scheme to continue for a 12-month transition period—a sensible management exercise—and it would close FIRS to all operators as of 30 June 2019. The Australian Labor Party will support this legislation. We see it as the logical next step in regulatory harmonisation. When FIRS was introduced in 1987, it represented the first step forward in the process of change, but, after more than 30 years of operation and the introduction of the national regulator, the scheme is becoming redundant. Indeed, less than two per cent of the nation's heavy vehicles—about 14,000—operate under this scheme. An independent evaluation of the scheme in 2016 found no evidence that FIRS was achieving its policy objectives, given the changes that have been made to national regulation. It concluded that the stamp duty exemption had neither reduced the age of the heavy vehicle fleet, nor improved road safety outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to recognise that the transitional arrangements for FIRS vehicles will include a one-off stamp duty exemption for vehicles exiting the scheme. Australia is a vast continent with an ever-increasing freight task. It's important that we invest in freight rail as well as roads to ensure that we can meet the ever-growing need for the movement of goods around our nation and to our ports for export. But it is also important that we keep moving forward on reducing regulatory complexity and that we continue to examine ways in which microeconomic reform can boost the national economy by boosting productivity. That's why this bill is important. Our road transport system needs one set of laws, one set of registration and compliance papers, one log book and as little red tape as possible. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

The Interstate Road Transport Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2018 is the first step in the delivery of a new system that better serves the needs of today's dynamic transport industry by removing a well-intended but now fundamentally dated mechanism—the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">FIRS was the first national registration scheme for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes and solely involved in interstate trade or commerce. Established in 1987 to address a perceived limitation on the authority of the states and territories to register vehicles for interstate transport, FIRS sought to address the challenges arising from a lack of uniformity in state and territory registration schemes. However, Australia has changed significantly in the last 30 years. Our needs are different. Our priorities have changed. Our collective regulatory capabilities have improved. FIRS has since been made redundant by increased jurisdictional cooperation, reforms to the heavy vehicle regulatory framework and changes in the business needs of the heavy vehicle industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aligns with the policy of successive Australian governments across the best part of the last decade and represents a bipartisan, consistent and continued commitment to close FIRS and progress national heavy vehicle reforms agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2009. The closure of FIRS will in turn make way for the introduction of a modern, national registration system for heavy vehicles that better serves the needs of today's transport industry. Accordingly, the initial amendment of the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and the subsequent repeal of all legislation enabling FIRS is the next logical step in moving Australia towards a fairer, more productive and efficient heavy vehicle industry. I would like to thank members for their constructive contribution to this debate and their support for this bill. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  I rise to support the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. Jacques Cousteau, perhaps the greatest oceanographer of the 20th century, once despaired that the sea and the air had become 'global garbage cans'. Cousteau also described the sea as the great unifier. He said that, when it came to the health of the ocean and its impact on people, all of humanity was in the same boat. He was right. When the seas are polluted, we all suffer. Other species, of course, in our oceans suffer directly, but the entire globe suffers. That is why it is so important that we accept and meet our shared responsibility to care for the health of our oceans. It's why we established the largest ever growth in marine parks and protection of our oceans when we were last in office, a reform tragically reversed by a short-sighted coalition government. It is why it is so important that we accept and meet that shared responsibility that we have to care for the health of our oceans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can do this in several ways. As individuals, we must take care not to litter our beaches, throw rubbish overboard from boats or, indeed, put things into the system of drainage that end up, quite often, in our oceans. As members of the community, we need to prevent harmful substances entering the oceans as run-off from our farms and other industries. It is a fact that, if you go into any major city around Australia and look at where the factories were located, they were always on water. In my electorate, along the Cooks River, you had everything from flour mills to sugar producers to industrial factories. The reason why they were located along rivers, canals and creeks, of course, was that they were seen as areas for free waste disposal by industry. That has had an enormous impact on the quality of the water in our urban waterways but also around our coasts and our ports. We know better today, but we need to make sure that legislation points the way forward with the modern understanding that we have that the accumulation of garbage and waste in our waterways has an impact on all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, Australia must always meet our responsibility to collaborate in the forums of the world to improve international maritime regulations relating to pollution. It is in that context that Labor will be supporting the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill enacts Australia's international obligations regarding the way in which we treat pollution from ships. Australia has been an active participant in the International Maritime Organization. When I was the minister, I directly addressed the international conferences of the IMO, because Australia is an island continent with responsibility for such a large proportion of the world's oceans and seas—some one-sixth. Think about that: one in every six square kilometres of the world's oceans and seas is Australia's responsibility. That is why it is critical that we keep up with those international obligations and that Australia continue to lead on these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In simple terms, this bill puts the responsibility on shippers to classify and declare waste from their solid bulk cargoes and to undertake not to dump waste that is designated as dangerous to the environment. It also prohibits the dumping of waste that is harmful to the environment in designated special areas like the Great Barrier Reef, the Torres Strait, the Coral Sea and the Antarctic zone. When many people think about pollution from boats, I suspect they think of oil spills or garbage thrown overboard, but a lot of the pollution from ships is linked to the shipping of bulk cargo: unpackaged homogenous goods like iron ore, coal, sugar, wheat and livestock. The pollution comes about through operational or accidental events during loading, unloading, cleaning or oil spills. For example, when a tanker carrying bulk goods unloads a cargo hold and is cleaned, it can release between 60 and 100 tonnes of cargo slurry—water which contains residue of the load. Most big tankers have five loads. That's a lot of potential pollution. It's estimated that 0.05 per cent of any given solid bulk load will be lost overboard one way or another. That's about 2.15 million tonnes a year. The waste can also include dead livestock—a matter of real concern, given the horrific revelations that have been made about the deaths of sheep being shipped to the Middle East.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to place restrictions on whether such material can be released into the ocean and, if it can be released, where it can be released. It tightens the existing legislation to reflect Australia's commitments under the latest annexure of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, also known as MARPOL—MARPOL is a convention of the International Maritime Organization—which came into effect on 1 March. The new rules classify pollution from ships as harmful if it poses an environmental threat by affecting the health or reproductive systems of plants or animals, including by causing cancer or mutations. These new rules mean this material cannot be dumped at sea. Some waste that is not designated as harmful may be released; however, this legislation quite rightly prevents it from being released in designated special areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes create a requirement for shippers to classify and declare their solid bulk cargoes as either harmful to the environment or not harmful. They will then be required to inform the master of the vessel carrying the cargo. This is about introducing responsibility chains to make sure that people are accountable. The master of the vessel will then determine the appropriate manner of discharge of the waste according to whether the ship is inside or outside one of these designated special areas. For example, while cargo residue not deemed harmful to the environment must not be dumped in designated special areas, it can be released in other places as far as is practicable from land. These are sensible changes. In a perfect world, we would never have to release any waste material into our oceans; however, we have to accept the reality that we need to move cargo by sea and that this will inevitably involve the production of waste that will make its way into the ocean. What we should do, however, is absolutely minimise it—do everything within our power to ensure that we protect our oceans. This legislation is a step forward because it bans the release of waste that is demonstrably harmful, while allowing the release of relatively safer material so long as it is outside of areas that are designated as being particularly sensitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good outcome for Australia. As an island continent, we move 99 per cent of our cargo by sea. Sea cargo is critical to our economic wellbeing because ships carry our mineral and agricultural exports to our customers around the world. Ships also bring us consumer goods that people rely upon and take for granted, including motor vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at the same time, Australia has some of the most environmentally sensitive marine environments on the planet. These wonderful habitats are not just environmental assets; they are, of course, economic assets. They attract tourists from right around the world. In the year to the end of February, some 8.9 million overseas visitors entered Australia, and between them they spent $41.3 billion. Tourism Australia has conducted surveys asking visitors their key reason for choosing Australia as a destination. Putting aside practical concerns like safety, the key reason given by visitors was Australia's aquatic and coastal experiences. The main reason tourists say they come to Australia is our coastline and marine environment. This tourism industry employs around about a million Australians, large numbers of whom are located along the Great Barrier Reef coast. We owe it to future generations to protect our environment, but we also owe it to ourselves to utilise these resources to create jobs and income. The key is to get the balance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key interest for Australia in this bill is that the Antarctic region will also be designated as a special area. It's a sensitive environment and, in many respects, it is unspoilt. Increasingly in recent years, cruise vessels have been taking tourists to the region. These provisions will reduce the tourism footprint by prohibiting vessels from releasing waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has an excellent record when working with other nations of the world to improve international laws on pollution and maritime issues. We have always been members of the International Maritime Organization, and we play an active part, including through our High Commission in London. Usually our considerations in these areas have not been subject to partisan politics, and that is as it should be. We have a national interest here as a parliament, as representatives, as good global citizens, to make sure that Australia's national interest is protected. This parliament has a responsibility to future generations to continue to play a central role in the protection of our environment. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I rise to speak on the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. Australia's neighbouring waters are home to beauteous, biodiverse ecosystems of unparalleled wonder. The Australian government has always encouraged the protection of our marine parks, and a recent announcement by our government supports that. Only a few weeks ago, we announced the largest-ever single investment in the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, totalling $500 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, one Google search made me realise that there is still work to be done in protecting the Great Barrier Reef. The statistics are certainly alarming. Each year, 180 million tonnes of toxic waste is dumped into our oceans. In waters around Australia there are, on average, 4,000 microplastic fragments per square kilometre, although some hotspots have concentrations of around 15,000 to 23,000. Further, 100,000 marine creatures die every year from plastic entanglement, and these are only the ones that have been found. Finally, scientists have declared 200 marine areas, amounting to the size of the UK, as dead zones where no life organisms can grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's beaches and coral reefs have been detrimentally affected by this futile dumping of waste. Contrary to popular belief, our beaches aren't littered with plastic dumped a million miles away and brought here by ocean currents; our beaches are littered with the plastic remnants of our own consumption. What litters our waters isn't merely solid plastic waste. Large amounts of toxic liquids, including dredge materials, industrial waste, sewage sludge and radioactive waste are illegally dumped in waters near our island home. Moreover, operational discharges from ships, such as sewage, galley scraps and cargo residues, are also tipped into our bordering oceans. Given the fact that five to six million shipping containers are sailing the world's oceans at any one moment, these operational discharges amount to a vast proportion of waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or MARPOL, in which Australia takes part, aims to reduce the amount of dumped operational discharges through six annexes which respectively regulate the following pollutive substances: oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form, sewage from ships, garbage from ships and air pollution from ships. These annexes are made Australian law via the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment bill suggested today aims to implement in the act alterations to annex V. The existing legislation outlines several conditions to be met before the discharge of cargo residues is permitted. For instance, with exception, the discharge must occur in seas outside a special area of Arctic waters, and the discharge must occur while the ship is proceeding en route and is as far as practicable from the nearest land. The amendments to such conditions are as follows: if the cargo residues are residues of solid bulk cargoes, the discharge will only be permitted if the master of the ship has a written declaration that the solid bulk cargoes have been classified in accordance with the criteria in appendix I of annex V of MARPOL and found to be not harmful to the marine environment. Essentially, this amendment will make it mandatory for shippers to classify and declare their solid bulk cargoes as harmful to the marine environment or non-harmful and inform the master of this classification. The master will thus be able to determine the appropriate manner of discharge for the residues of these cargoes according to whether the ship is located outside or within a special area of Arctic waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are additionally a couple of minor amendments included in this bill. If legislated, the bill will alter provisions of the act to allow regulations and orders to apply, adopt or incorporate relevant documents or instruments. This change parallels provisions in other existing legislation that implements MARPOL and allows Australia to keep up with the frequent amendment and adoption cycle of the International Maritime Organization. The bill will also alter the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Act 1981, removing the need for regulations to prescribe the manner in which a protection-of-the-sea levy notice may be served in particular circumstances. This will allow obsolete and now pointless regulation to be repealed. Just like any other Liberal policy, these two amendments will enhance efficient practices in this industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Mackellar, almost every suburb is bordered by a beach—a beach where children build sandcastles, bury themselves in the sand and swim until the sun goes down. I'm therefore focused more than most on the health of our seas. We must ensure that our water, in which our children—and my daughter—swim, remains free of toxic substances and grimy waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scientific research has shown that polluted oceans potentially engender hormonal and reproductive problems, nervous system damage, kidney failure, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and heart disease. Of even greater significance is the fact that 70 per cent of the oxygen we breathe is produced by marine plants. If we continue to dump toxic waste in the ocean, our sources of oxygen will diminish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who do not care for the environment should at least care for the health of their own children, not to mention themselves. I want my daughter to be able to play on a beach as clean as those in my youth. We should aim to be the first generation that can say we left our children a better environment than we inherited. Through Australia's participation in the international marine organisation, we have taken steps to count back the years and bring our oceans to the state they were in 50 years ago. We have enacted legislation to prohibit sea dumping, conserve our biodiverse marine ecosystems and protect our waters from the adverse effects of shipping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made great progress, but there is still a long voyage ahead. The fact that it takes 400 years for plastics to degrade in the water, the fact that we have spilt 1½ million tonnes of oil in the past 30 years and the fact that our millions of crates of cargo are producing tonnes of ocean-dumped waste are ringing alarm bells, reminding us to take action for our sake and for the sake of future generations.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise today in support of the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, and I do so because it is a good bill and the right thing to do. We heard the member for Grayndler earlier talk in support of this bill and about why it's important to do so. I've spoken about this issue many times before in this parliament, and I would just like to reiterate one more time that the seat of Hindmarsh that I represent has 18 kilometres of seafront, coast, that affects our tourism and recreation. They are the beaches for the western suburbs and, in fact, for most of the metropolitan area of Adelaide, so it's very important that we keep them pristine, beautiful and very well looked after, as we have done so for many years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to represent such an area. It has some of the best beaches in Australia, like Glenelg, Henley, Grange and all the way up to West Beach, Somerton, Tennyson and parts of Semaphore Beach. These are absolutely beautiful seafront, sandy beaches that the entire Adelaide region uses for recreation, barbecues, swimming and a whole range of other things. Not only South Australians but also many international tourists use them. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see why a bill like this is so important. A short distance further north is the port of Port Adelaide and the harbour of Outer Harbor, which have lots of ships coming in. We want the ships that visit the coastline all around Australia to do the right thing and to do what they can, through legislation such as this, to ensure that our beaches around the country and their beautiful ecosystems are kept in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, my electorate and its beaches are a tourism hub that draws people from all over the state, all over the country and, of course, all over the world during the summer. I and my constituents are privileged to be surrounded by such a beautiful environment, and that is why this bill is so important. The international treatment of pollution from ships is something that we have to be engaged in as a nation. We have to ensure that we take part, as we heard from the previous speakers earlier, in international forums, agreements and discussions that support and strengthen our ability to keep our coastlines pristine. In fact, this is such an important issue to South Australians that back in 2001, I think it was, there was a Senate inquiry into the Gulf St Vincent, which is basically the gulf that Adelaide's coast is on. The inquiry recommended that action needed to be taken to ensure that the gulf and its recreation fishing, fishing businesses and tourism et cetera were there for many years to come. We also had, back in 2005, Labor's inquiry—we were in opposition at the time—into the Gulf St Vincent, and many of the issues in this bill were mentioned at that time. When we came into government we implemented many of those findings, but there is still a long way to go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation affects just about every coastline around the country. In my electorate, the coastline is home to a variety of birds, insects and reptiles, many of which are native to the area. I also have one of the last sand dunes in the metropolitan area, Tennyson Dunes, which is a pristine environmental ecosystem that is being preserved. We also have some dunes further south at Somerton Beach. This is why my constituents recognise that this is such an important issue and such an important bill. It is a delicate ecosystem, and we appreciate the area for what it is. We can see how perhaps some ships that are coming in aren't doing the right thing and could damage the entire coast. They could damage not only the coastline and its waters but also the tourism, businesses and a whole range of other things that go with it. This is something that I've fought very hard for to ensure that we can preserve and conserve it for future generations. I'm sure that all members in this House whose electorate has a coastline feel the same way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The River Torrens goes through the middle of my electorate. Many years ago, there were lots of industries along this river such as Onkaparinga Textiles, Michell leather, and Mason and Cox. They were all put there for a reason, and that was that the waste would go straight into the river and out to sea. Lots of those archaic practices have now stopped, because the flow to the sea means damage to the ecosystem in our waters, the Gulf St Vincent. I suppose this bill is there to do the same thing: so that ships who are carrying goods that shouldn't be let out into the sea are stopped from doing so. That is why it's an important bill and something that we on this side are supporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Sunday of March each year is Clean Up Australia Day, a day where thousands of Australians go out and clean up in their areas and on the coastline. We had some wonderful groups that did some clean-up on the day. We saw the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Adelaide West community create a Clean Up Australia Day event along Tapleys Hill Road, which is basically the coastline of my electorate. The danger of everyday littering is a real concern to our coasts, and we recognise the efforts of the people who volunteer their time for the sake of conservation. The local community are committed to the conservation of our environment and they do their part. Accordingly, all of us in this place should stand up for legislation such as this that will protect the marine environment and our coastlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members in this chamber will be well aware that nearly all of Australia's exports travel via ship, with a significant portion consisting of solid bulk cargo. In fact, we heard earlier speakers say that one-sixth of every kilometre of water in the world is Australia's responsibility. That's why this bill is so important. It's important to our national export trade, and it does no unnecessary harm to our shores and our imports. It's crucial that we take action—in particular, in sensitive marine areas such as the Great Barrier Reef, the Torres Strait and Antarctica. What is terrifying about bulk cargo shipping is that we do not know for certain what the environmental risks are. This bill will ensure that shippers classify and declare solid bulk cargoes which could be harmful to the marine environment, and goods which are not harmful to the marine environment, and inform the master of this classification. This will allow us to determine the appropriate manner of discharge for the residues of these cargoes according to whether the ship is located outside or within special areas, or Arctic waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that 2.15 million tonnes enter the ocean every year just as the result of bulk cargo shipping. Deputy Speaker, you can see what this does to our environment. Australian households—each and every one of us—are also encouraged to do our part for the environment and to introduce environmentally conscious measures that work for everyday household goods as well. As such, I welcome this reform, which ensures that this parliament does its part for conservation and for our seas. Australian cargo that ends up in the sea ends up there as a result of the ship which holds the waste being washed, or because the waste was dumped, or for one of a range of other reasons. This bill will put the responsibility back onto the shippers. Shippers will have to classify and declare their cargo. Shippers will be advised of the methods of discharge which are the safest for the environment, depending on what's appropriate to their circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a reform that's done in isolation. It's done to align Australia with its latest obligations internationally. As I said earlier, it is our duty to ensure that we take part in forums, international discussions and international agreements, because one-sixth of the ocean is Australia's responsibility. We're an island, we're surrounded by water, most of our exports and imports come via the water, so it's very important to ensure that we keep our beaches and our environment and a whole range of other things pristine and clean. Worldwide, 9.5 billion tonnes of solid bulk cargo are transported annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our overseas friends, neighbours and trading partners have already stepped up and implemented protection for the sea from ships, and they follow the convention put forward by the International Maritime Organization. The IMO is the UN agency which is responsible for improving maritime safety and preventing pollution, and Australia is a member state. For five decades the IMO has worked with governments and industry to establish less harmful systems that won't affect the environment in an adverse way. Internationally, this convention came into effect in March 2018, a month ago. There are many other nations which will be encouraged to ratify this convention as well. There is broad support internationally for the further prevention of pollution from ships, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see further international agreements being signed, strengthening the prevention of pollution from ships et cetera as much as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a resource-rich maritime nation, which Australia is, we should be cooperating internationally to prevent toxins and anything else from being dumped into the sea. Loading and unloading of bulk cargo presents a risk. There'll always be a risk with it for Australian ports, and we should have regulations that encourage the very best practice. We need to do much more to prevent further accidents that risk the condition of the sea. As I said, we're an island nation, so it's understandable that 99 per cent of all our trade is done via bulk cargo shipping. It's important to highlight that this bill does not seek to impact this trade—far from it. In comparison to Australia, there would be very few nations in which a strong shipping industry is so imperative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill and I ask that other members consider doing so, to protect the sea not just for now but for future generations of Australians who will continue to use our pristine beaches and our pristine environment, and to ensure that the enjoyment that we get out of the beach and through recreational fishing, swimming et cetera is handed down to many generations of Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I speak in support of the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 and in support of the comments made by the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Grayndler earlier on. This is important legislation because the world's oceans are critical to our wellbeing. We have a responsibility, as do all countries, to protect the ocean environment. The world's oceans are already heavily polluted, and marine life is dying. Oceanic ecosystems are seriously at risk. Land based runoff, oil spills, floating plastics, radioactive waste, untreated sewage, pesticides and other matters are all making their way or being directly discharged into the oceans, with catastrophic consequences. Inside the Pacific Ocean, it is reported that there is an island of garbage, mainly plastics, twice the size of Texas. That's just one location. There are now several dead zones in ocean waters across the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go on to some other statistics, which obviously are very hard to verify, but I can only take them at face value. Ocean pollution is killing one million seabirds each year. Over 100,000 marine mammals die every year from plastic entanglement and indigestion, and 300,000 dolphins and porpoises die each year because of entanglement with discarded fishing nets. There are other statistics that I could allude to as well which just highlight the incredible damage and destruction that is being caused throughout our oceans each and every day. If the same level of destruction were occurring on land, there would be widespread public outcry, but, because it is occurring in the oceans, the damage is out of sight and out of mind. Of course, it is also much more difficult to bring to account those responsible for the pollution and to quantify the pollution itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that a considerable amount of ocean pollution is directly caused by sea vessels. The latest figures state that there are at present about 11,000 bulk carriers operating around the world and over 52,000 merchant ships. The combined pollution to oceans being caused by those vessels is immeasurable, but it is never quantified or seen. Yet we have come to rely on them, because 90 per cent of goods are transported across the world on sea vessels. As the member for Grayndler pointed out, for Australia the figure is 99 per cent because we are an island country and, indeed, we are also a great exporter of minerals and the like, and those all require bulk carriage, whether it's oil containers, gas supplies that we sell overseas, coal or iron ore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Grayndler also pointed out—and I want to quote these figures—that it is estimated that 60 to 100 tonnes of cargo slurry per hold is discharged into the ocean after washing down at the end of each voyage. The average bulk carrier has five holds, which equates to, on average, between 300 and 500 tonnes of slurry dumped into the ocean waters at the end of each journey. When you multiply that figure by the thousands of carriers operating throughout the world, the pollution levels are staggering. Just as concerning is that many of the carriers are operated by entities that have shown little regard for ethical practices with regard to both the crews they employ and their general operational methods. As we know, many of those carriers are flagged in jurisdictions such as the Bahamas and others where oversight is at best questionable. Being on the ocean and out of sight makes it extremely difficult for authorities to monitor their activities. Indeed, I ask the question: who does monitor activities on the high seas? Australia has jurisdiction over its own coastal waters. Perhaps that jurisdiction in some cases extends to the 200-kilometre mark or thereabouts, but what happens beyond that? That would apply to each country: who does monitor the activities of ocean vessels once they get into the high seas and outside of jurisdictional waters?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this legislation relates to the transport of solid bulk cargo, which includes iron ore, coal, bauxite, alumina, minerals, sugar and wheat. It also includes livestock. As we know, Australia is a major exporter of live animals. It's a subject we debated in this House only yesterday. It was the matter of public importance. It's a matter which has been the subject of much public interest and controversy over many, many years. The debate to date has been essentially about live animal exports, and it's been focused on the horrific cruelty associated with that trade. Today I want to raise an additional concern that I have about the trade: the ocean pollution that is associated with live exports. Over the eight-year period between 2010 and 2017, according to government figures, Australia exported 25 million live animals. That number was made up of mainly cattle and sheep: 7.6 million cattle and 17.4 million sheep. Of those animals, 144,000 died. Two questions arise in my mind from those figures. Firstly, how much waste was created from those transports; how was that waste disposed of; and where was it disposed of? I don't know. I doubt that anybody else knows. Secondly, how were the dead livestock disposed of? If we look at the photos and the footage of the recent incident, where 2,400 sheep died aboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span>, we can see how they were disposed of. They were simply dumped into the ocean. Many of those dead animals were already infected. They weren't just dead; in many cases they died because of disease and infection, and yet they were simply dumped overboard. The reports would suggest that they were in a terrible state. What damage is that doing to our ocean waters? Indeed, which waters were they dumped in and was there a management plan for the way that they were discarded? I doubt that very much. I also doubt very much that the figures that we have on the number of animals that were thrown overboard are accurate. Quite frankly, looking at some of the material that's been provided to us in the past about those carriers, the figures that they provide, I believe, are at best questionable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2003, when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cormo Express</span> was in the Middle East and there were suggestions that all of the sheep on board—in excess of 50,000—should be dumped overboard as a way to save them from further cruelty, the Australian Veterinary Association president at the time said that to dump those sheep overboard would be 'an environmental disaster'. In other words, it would be an environmental disaster for the ocean waters where they would be dumped. Yet that is exactly what we continue to do with animals that die on board these ships. And that's not to mention the risks to the crew that have to handle those dead animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I say, with respect to this legislation and that particular matter, that it is important legislation, because government should know what's on board vessels, what is being discharged into the oceans and how it is being discharged. If we at least know, there might be some opportunity to establish regulations, procedures and protocols for how it should be done. Again, whether it can be monitored and regulated is another matter, but at least knowing what is occurring is a very good start to managing a very serious problem. It's all well and good to say that the oceans cover 75 per cent of the earth's surface—that there's a lot of water out there and anything that is discharged into the oceans will inevitably dissipate and present little environmental risk. But the evidence shows otherwise. Discharge presents a very serious risk, wherever people are across the world, because of ocean currents which carry the waste material from one side of the world to the other, and so we are all affected by the bad practices of those who use our ocean waters and are prepared to turn a blind eye to, or not apply, the standards that one would expect of them. The International Maritime Organization standards try to manage that as best as they can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia there is additional importance to all of this. As other speakers have pointed out, the Great Barrier Reef has an economic value of some $56 billion and an annual economic contribution of $6.4 billion to this country. We're talking about serious values here which in turn generate economic activity and jobs for the people of Australia, but this will only continue if we're able to preserve the Great Barrier Reef in its current state. Similarly, we have a fisheries and aquaculture industry in this country that was worth some $2.8 billion in 2014-15, according to ABARES. I expect the figure might be even higher today than it was two or three years ago. Whether it is or not, we're talking, in round figures, of a $3 billion fishing industry in this country, which would be predominantly sea based. Therefore, it's in our economic interest as a nation to ensure that we preserve the quality of the waters in our oceans. The constant environmental damage that is occurring, as I pointed out with the figures I referred to earlier on, is destroying marine life. If it destroys marine life then the ecosystem cycle will continue and ultimately our fishing stocks will be depleted. That will in turn directly affect the fishing industry of this country, something that Labor tried to protect when it was last in government through the conservation-of-marine-parks proposals that we had in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important legislation. It's important legislation because it goes to the heart of environmental matters that affect the people of the world, and it goes to the heart of economic matters which, in turn, go straight to the social interests of the people of this country. It is important legislation. I hope it does make a difference. It's legislation that goes in the right direction. Only time will tell what difference it has made.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments contained in this bill primarily implement international maritime environmental protection obligations adopted at the International Maritime Organization into our domestic law. Through the IMO Australia has played an important role in developing the amendments. The key amendments will ensure the master of a ship has vital information in relation to the cargo on board. This allows the master to discharge cargo residues appropriately, depending on the location of the vessel and the nature of residues discharged. Importantly, those residues can now be discharged into the sea in a defined set of circumstances where it has been determined that the residues are not harmful to the marine environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are consistent with Australia's longstanding support for protecting the marine environment, and implementing them further highlights our commitment to the International Maritime Organization. It is my view that Australia's maritime interests are best advanced through internationally agreed arrangements, including through the IMO. These amendments will also allow Australia to apply our international obligations through domestic legislation and ensure we are keeping up with the IMO's frequent amendment and adoption cycle.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes a machinery change to the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Act 1981, removing the need for regulations to prescribe the manner in which a protection of the sea levy notice may be served in particular circumstances. This minor change will allow the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Regulations to be repealed, removing a dated and now unnecessary piece of legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  Labor supports this bill, the Statute Update (Autumn 2018) Bill 2018, which is a standard piece of legislative housekeeping—that is the proper term for it. These bills, under both the Abbott and Turnbull governments, regrettably had been given a status which they did not deserve. The reason I say that is that the purpose of bills like this is largely to correct typographical errors that have occurred in acts as a result of drafting and clerical mistakes, and to remove obsolete and spent legislation from the statute books. It's essentially a routine housekeeping bill to keep the statute books up to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot help but cast my mind back to the way in which the Abbott government dealt with routine updating of typographical errors or spent legislation. The House will remember the great farce that was the Abbott government's multiple repeal days. At that time, we heard feverish talk about a bonfire of regulations. With tremendous fanfare and much boasting on each of its two repeal days in 2015, the Abbott government introduced a statute law revision bill and an amending acts repeal bill. The government claimed at the time that they would achieve somewhere between $1 billion and $2.1 billion in savings in compliance cost. This, as with so much of the Abbott and now the Turnbull government's proclamations, was fanciful and disingenuous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people would have been forgiven for thinking that the statute law revisions bills and the amending acts repeal bills of 2015 were bold reform cast large on the national stage. They were not. Every year Australian parliaments pass these bills, which correct typos, update drafting and improve formatting and numbering, among other things. Amending acts repeal bills simply remove from the statute books now-redundant laws which are no longer in force because they have served their purpose of amending or repealing other acts of parliament. The notion that meaningful deregulation was achieved by repealing amending acts which had not been in force for decades was nonsense and it was misleading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has a genuine belief in appropriate and necessary regulation. Where there is a need for deregulation, Labor will support it, but deregulation must be meaningful and, unlike our opponents, Labor will not cast the routine work of the parliament as an exercise in massive deregulation. Labor governments have successfully provided sweeping competition reform, the floating of the dollar and the slashing of tariffs. This was meaningful deregulation. Labor has never shied away from removing regulations which do not serve a worthwhile purpose. However, we do believe, unlike the government, that we need regulation to protect labour standards, our consumers and our environment. But we have never supported regulation for regulation's sake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when the government puts forward anodyne but necessary measures like those in this bill, we are happy to support them. The amendments in this bill are intended to enhance readability, facilitate interpretation and administration, and promote consistency across the Commonwealth statute book. The amendments are minor and technical in nature and make either no change or only very minor changes to the substance of the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains six schedules. Schedule 1 corrects errors in five principal acts and makes minor technical improvements to clarify the text of the law. Schedule 2 amends four acts to replace outdated references to 'the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia' with references to 'Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand'. Schedule 3 to the bill makes amendments to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 which are consequential to the amendment of the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reforms) Act 2015. Schedule 4 repeals 22 obsolete references to the Crown in the right of Norfolk Island, reflecting the abolition of that body politic on 1 July 2016. Schedule 5 repeals spent provisions in two acts. Schedule 6 repeals 40 amending acts which are now obsolete.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, like many similar bills that have come before successive parliaments, will not set the world alight, but they are a necessary administrative task of the parliament, and the Labor Party supports them. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

The government takes its role of maintaining the integrity of the Commonwealth statute book seriously. While the Statute Update (Autumn 2018) Bill 2018 may seem a comparatively modest bill in scope, it nonetheless performs the important task of updating and improving the quality and accuracy of Commonwealth legislation. This bill makes minor and technical changes that are necessary to correct drafting and clerical mistakes, make technical improvements to legislation and repeal spent acts and provisions of acts. These amendments contribute to the government's regulatory reform agenda by improving the accuracy and usability of Commonwealth legislation. This bill was prepared on the initiative of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I would like to thank the office for its ongoing work in the area. I thank members for their support for the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to say from the outset that Labor endorses schedule 3 of this bill. The proposed statutory infrastructure provider regime will offer certainty in that, as we move beyond the initial NBN rollout, every Australian home and small business can continue to access high-speed broadband infrastructure. This proposes to legislate an important reform that was first initiated by Labor almost a decade ago. Broadband is about liberating social opportunity and economic growth, two engines of the modern Labor Party. It is for this very reason that we on this side of the House understand that access to high-speed broadband should not be a luxury or a random suburban lottery. Rather, it should be a fundamental right. In the information age, if opportunity does not begin in the home or in the classroom, then it simply does not begin anywhere. Without equality of opportunity, you are selling the nation short on economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the NBN was established, the policy objective of universal access was implemented through a statement of expectations issued to the NBN Co board. This, in turn, required the company to make the network accessible to all Australians as part of its rollout. It took those opposite many years to come to the party and sign up to the concept of a ubiquitous national broadband network. They resisted but, in the end, they had no choice. The Australian public gave them no choice. So we can take a measure of satisfaction in having fought for and reached this point. The statutory provider obligations may improve outcomes for small businesses setting up in new estates and commercial precincts. Coming from a local government background and a telco regulatory background, I—and Labor—appreciate that we need to improve the coordination between developers and infrastructure providers to ensure connectivity is available and ready for businesses to use once they are ready to start trading. I and my colleagues receive too many complaints about this problem and its impact, particularly on small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area where all tiers of government can continue engaging with the objective to improve the consistency of arrangements across states and developers. This comes back to the basics: early and consistent communication between developers and infrastructure providers to ensure the necessary planning and contracts are in place for the supply of communication services. Hopefully, schedule 3 can be a platform to build on previous discussions and the new development's policy. I also acknowledge the good work of those industry and consumer stakeholders who have advocated for the design of the statutory infrastructure provider regime. Amid the robustness of the public NBN debate, the important work of establishing a policy framework that places consumers at the centre must continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now wish to turn to schedule 4 of this bill, which proposes the introduction of an NBN levy. It is telling that, in the week of the federal budget, the Turnbull government is seeking to pass a broadband tax that is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. This levy is expected to add $84 to the annual broadband bill for the homes and businesses on non-NBN networks subject to this tax. Estimates of the number of services affected by this levy range from 240,000 to 450,000. Let me make this clear from the outset: Labor considers this levy to be poorly designed and the targeting of particular networks to be arbitrary, and the need to now even contemplate its existence in this place is highly regrettable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is only one reason we have arrived at this point, and that is the poor judgement of this Prime Minister. In 2009, the then Labor government decided to build a national broadband network that would extend universal coverage of broadband to regional and remote Australia—seven per cent of the population—through a combination of fixed wireless and satellite technologies. This was a critical initiative—one which we and the Australian public endorsed as absolutely necessary. This decision to extend high-speed broadband to unprofitable areas was funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. In short, this meant NBN users in the cities would cross-subsidise higher-cost services in the regions that the private sector would otherwise neither invest in nor serve. This framework was achieved through a universal wholesale access price that was approved by the ACCC. Having a universal wholesale pricing regime with a levy coming in later over the top was not contemplated. The consideration was that you have either one or the other but not both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time, the cost of the fixed wireless and satellite rollout has not changed from what was expected. However, the technology composition of the NBN and its revenue potential have changed. We now have an inferior multi-technology mix, which, according to NBN Co's own analysis, will cost at least $200 million more per annum in steady state to maintain and operate and will generate $300 million less per annum in revenue relative to a fibre-to-the-premises network. That's a $500 million earnings gap. On top of this, in August 2017, roughly 300,000 homes—an estimated 220,000 of which would have been revenue generating—disappeared off the NBN business plan, yet cumulative capital expenditure forecasts for rollout completion increased by 1.4 billion from the year before. This would suggest taxpayers are spending the same, or possibly more, for the NBN to serve fewer connected homes. That is another $140 million per annum in revenue that's not coming back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed broadband levy before this parliament is a consequence of the failures of a government that consistently gets the big calls wrong. It is an admission that the economics of the multi-technology mix have deteriorated. The Prime Minister knew there was no way he could deliver the NBN for $29 billion by the end of 2016. He then promised to deliver it for $41 billion, but that promise also came and went. We now have a $49 billion multi-technology mix whose long-term economics differ markedly from a fibre rollout. This second-rate network costs more to maintain, delivers slower speeds and will require expensive future upgrades that could have been avoided. Furthermore, the NBN has less revenue potential and the multi-technology mix is more exposed to wireless competition. NBN Co recently confirmed that, for every one per cent loss of market share to mobile competitors, the business case could forego up to $1.5 billion in revenue over the life of the project. In April this year, the CEO of Telstra estimated one million more consumers than the number today could substitute wireless for NBN. If that number were to materialise at some point in the future, it could reduce NBN's market share to 65 per cent. Critically, for the taxpayer, none of these costs or risks are reflected in the $49 billion price tag. In addition, it is questionable whether the extent of these risks is adequately reflected in the projected internal rate of return. In contrast, fibre would have preserved an indefinite performance and reliability edge for decades to come. But the copper being deployed by this government has already ceded that edge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth noting that, prior to the 2013 election, the now Prime Minister was encouraging companies to invest in fixed line infrastructure and bypass the NBN. By encouraging fixed line providers to bypass the NBN, particularly given the significant public investment that was being made, this Prime Minister scored an own goal. His poor judgement has undermined NBN Co's revenue streams that would otherwise have improved the capacity of the company to support services for regional consumers and delivered a better return for taxpayers. The Prime Minister understood that what he was advocating for would actually undercut the NBN business model. He understood this very clearly, but that seemingly didn't matter to him in 2013. As a prospective incoming shareholder minister, his desire to see the NBN undermined by competitors was both disappointing and contrary to the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was no coincidence that TPG announced some 10 days after the 2013 election that it planned to deploy a fibre-to-the-basement network to up to half a million premises that NBN intended to serve. Networks expanded, investments were made and the revenue sensitivities of the NBN business case became more acute. The cost of the NBN increased from $29 billion to $41 billion in late 2013. By August 2015, the cost of the multitechnology mix had again blown out by a further $8 billion. Leaks revealed the cost of remediating the copper network had increased tenfold to over $600 million. Come 2017, retail service providers were sanctioned for charging customers for speeds the copper NBN could not deliver. Statements released by the ACCC indicated that one in two customers on the top-speed tiers had their speeds downgraded and were being compensated as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has established that no funding has been set aside in the NBN business case out to the year 2040 to upgrade the copper footprint. Put another way: the already precarious economics of the NBN business case operate on the assumption that Australians won't need their copper connection upgraded for at least another 23 years. The chief NBN engineer apparently doesn't believe this, telecommunications experts don't believe this and the Australian public wouldn't accept this, yet that is the assumption underpinning the government's NBN business case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in late 2017, the HFC rollout was brought to a halt due to ongoing reliability issues and service dropouts. Leading up to this period, the NBN CEO was giving radio and television interviews arguing for a new tax on mobile services. More recently, it was revealed that NBN put a secret proposal to the government to dump the entire HFC network. This is hardly surprising given the cost of the Prime Minister's HFC rollout and its increase by almost $2 billion over recent years. This is a collective measure of the difficult times we are in. It is the consequence of an expensive multitechnology mix that remains as confused and incoherent in 2018 as it was in 2013. But I do wish to observe that, more broadly, the fact that we are standing here in the House today debating the introduction of a new broadband levy being proposed by the government while we have a universal wholesale pricing regime that will deliver a regional cross-subsidy of over $700 million per annum by 2021, in conjunction with a $300 million per annum universal service obligation—which remains in need of reform, by the way—underscores the need for a more holistic and coherent approach to communications policy in Australia. This government has been nothing short of hopeless on this front.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the specifics of the bill, it is the view of Labor that the primary benefit of the proposed levy charge is that it would, in effect, introduce a price signal that deters the inefficient duplication of fixed line infrastructure and deters cherrypicking of profitable parts of the NBN footprint. Simply put, it places NBN on a more level playing field. It is appropriate to ensure there is a level playing field so that fixed-line operators competing in areas NBN intends to serve or is serving or those who are considering deploying infrastructure to compete directly with NBN down the track understand they would not have a structural competitive advantage, because NBN has to embed a regional cross-subsidy into its pricing. So it is appropriate that NBN Co should be able to compete on a level playing field. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is important is that we are also clear about what the playing field actually is. Measures that aim to achieve a level playing field should not stray into already well-served markets where NBN is not obliged to invest its capital. The somewhat desperate inclusion of enterprise networks in this levy falls into this category. If NBN Co want to compete for business and enterprise revenue, that is fine and we wish them luck. Naturally, applying the lens of a shareholder, having NBN do well in the business segment is good for the company and some of those benefits may indirectly spill over to consumers. However, we should not begin taking policy settings from the residential footprint where interventions were addressed at a market failure and then apply those settings in enterprise markets where such failure did not exist. Optus summarised this well in its submission to the inquiry on this bill where it stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there is a need to distinguish between NBN Co's … monopoly services and its future plans to deploy services in contestable nonresidential markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their submission went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Contestable services are services in competitive markets. We are aware that NBN Co may have future plans to deploy services in this area; however, in doing so it will be entering an existing competitive market and competing with existing commercial services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it goes on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are no cease sale or separation obligations for these services because there was no evidence of market failure that necessitated NBN displacing these existing networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The retrospective application of this levy to existing greenfield networks is also deeply concerning, as these are areas where, again, NBN Co has not invested capital and is not required to serve. NBN are free to compete with business for business in greenfield areas—and, again, we wish them well. However, investments in greenfield networks often operated by companies who are more modest in their size have been made up to this point based on certain regulatory assumptions. This government is proposing to move those goalposts, which does now happen in public policy. Nonetheless, the proposed retrospective application of the levy to areas where NBN and a greenfield operator are not competing directly for the same customer is a cause for concern. As OptiComm stated in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this draft legislation, the proposed levy charge is 100 times the per service contribution that telecommunications companies currently make to fund the universal service obligation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, it's the Prime Minister who owns this proposed levy. It is for this Prime Minister to explain why this government wants to give big business an $80 billion tax cut while introducing a new telecommunications charge that will add at least $84 to the annual broadband bill of impacted households on non-NBN networks. And it is for the Prime Minister to explain why it is always the consumer and the Australian taxpayer who are being asked to pay for his NBN failures time and again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional Australians know that, when it comes to broadband, only Labor will consistently deliver on their behalf because Labor believes in the NBN. For over 11 years, John Howard and the Nationals did nothing to advance the cause of broadband in the regions. In the period that followed, we have made good progress in improving the quality of regional communications infrastructure, but more remains to be done. Labor will continue to place regional consumers and equality of access front and centre of our policymaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now to the carrier separation rules and touch briefly on these rules contained in schedules 1 and 2. The superfast network rules in parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act were introduced in 2011 and apply to superfast fixed-line networks servicing residential and small business customers. As noted in the explanatory memorandum, part 7 requires operators of such networks to supply a layer 2 bitstream service to access seekers. Part 8 requires the networks to be wholesale only—that is, structurally separated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes several amendments to make the default structural separation requirement clearer and more effective as a baseline for the industry, while at the same time creating new commercial opportunities. These amendments reset the structural separation arrangements and establish some flexibility for functional separation arrangements, subject to ACCC oversight. As the competition and consumer regulator, the ACCC is well placed to perform this role and exercise judgements about the instances in which permitting functional separation will serve the long-term interests of end users. On this basis, Labor supports schedules 1 and 2. The grandfathering arrangements, which propose to amend part 8 such that the current wholesale-only obligations in section 143 of the Telecommunications Act will generally apply to high-speed networks that came into existence between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2018, appear sensible. So it follows that the proposed section 142C would apply the new structural separation or functional separation rules to local access lines that come into existence after 1 July 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, Labor supports schedules 1 and 2. We will support their passage, as with schedule 3, the statutory infrastructure provider regime, which we welcome, and we will not be opposing schedule 4 here today. I circulate the amendment standing in my name.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018. Labor has long been on record with concerns about the impact of lottery betting or synthetic lotteries on Australian consumers and small businesses. These concerns prompted Labor to consult with a range of stakeholders, including the newsagents national body, in the lead-up to the launch of the Lottoland's Gotta Go! campaign, as well as with lottery betting provider Lottoland, as an example. These concerns prompted Labor to formally request the ACCC to undertake an investigation into representations made by companies that offer betting on lottery results, such as Lottoland, given concerns they may mislead or deceive consumers into believing they are purchasing a lottery ticket or directly participating in a lottery. The ACCC responded by undertaking to continue to review developments and complaints received in relation to these services. Twice, Labor declined to support proposed Senate amendments to ban synthetic lotteries on the run, citing the need for stakeholder consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has kept a watching brief on these issues for over a year now, including the measures that have been implemented or are being considered by individual states and territories. For example, last year the Northern Territory government introduced a prohibition on betting on the outcome of Australian lotteries. This was a welcome step but didn't address all the concerns associated with lottery betting services. South Australia does not permit lottery betting services, and it appears that this has been effective in stopping these services being provided to South Australian residents. The Tasmanian government announced in October last year that it will take steps towards banning lottery outcome wagering. Media reports have indicated that Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia are currently considering laws to prohibit lottery betting services being offered to persons in their respective jurisdictions. Labor has undertaken extensive consultation on these issues and considered these arguments carefully. There are arguments for and against banning synthetic lottery products. After extensive stakeholder consultation and on balance, Labor believes it is appropriate to support the bill to ban lottery betting in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the issue of Commonwealth jurisdiction. While the states and territories have made some moves, as I've described, it is the Commonwealth that has responsibility for online gambling matters. The Commonwealth is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. This will be consistent with the National Consumer Protection Framework, harm minimisation measures across all states and territories and the new credit betting prohibition in the IGA that came into effect on 17 February this year. The ACMA would be responsible for compliance and can respond to any complaints about lottery betting services being provided by either Australian or international operators. The intent of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 is to minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia. Lottery draws are permitted under the IGA as there have traditionally been only a small number of draws conducted each week—some seven draws conducted across a week, typically, with a day's break in between. On the contrary, lottery betting services allow consumers to bet on the outcome of up to 25 lottery draws being conducted around the world each week, with the promise of massive jackpots ranging up in the hundreds of millions of dollars, which could lead to problem and at-risk gambling. While Lottoland, for example, is a disruptor seeking to offer consumers greater choice in gambling products and change the dynamic between Tatts, Tabcorp and retailers like the newsagents and other such outlets, this is not the kind of disruption or choice we seek to promote in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend the IGA to prohibit gambling service providers from providing to customers physically present in Australia a service for betting on the outcome of, or a contingency in, Australian and overseas lottery draws, including keno-type lotteries, with the effect of banning synthetic lotteries such as Lottoland. This is not a decision that Labor has taken lightly. Synthetic lotteries allow customers to bet on the outcome of a lottery draw without the need to purchase a ticket in that official lottery draw. Unlike official lottery draws, ticket sales will not cover major payouts. Instead, these are covered by insurance policies. A contingency would include the drawing of a particular number, for example, at a particular position or in a particular sequence. As I said, the bill follows those moves by some states and territories to prohibit betting on the outcome of a lottery and action by the Northern Territory government to prohibit betting on the outcome of an Australian lottery. On balance, Labor supports the bill because it responds to concerns, which we share, that the provision of synthetic lotteries in Australia and the potential expansion of these services in the near future will cause adverse impacts on states and territories, small businesses and consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that Lottoland has already undertaken a range of actions to address these concerns and be a responsible corporate participant, and is prosecuting what one may say is an arguable case as a fast-growing but otherwise relatively small disruptor, seeking to increase choice, competition and innovation in the market. However, as I said, on balance, we feel that lottery betting is not the kind of disruption, choice, competition or innovation that Labor seeks to promote as a first-order issue. Further, some measures are subject to investigation by regulators, and there is no assurance that other synthetic lottery providers who enter the market will seek to address those concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak briefly on the impact on state and territory revenues. I note that state governments have voiced concerns that synthetic lotteries are siphoning tax revenue collections away from community services. Over $1 billion in taxation revenue is currently received from states and territories each year from the sale of tickets in official lottery draws, which contributes to charitable causes and community services. Lottoland is licensed in the Northern Territory. It pays GST and corporate taxes. It supports, as it has asserted, paying state point-of-consumption taxes, and it makes community contributions. Furthermore, Lottoland submits that it does not cannibalise official lotteries, because its product offering has grown the market and it targets a different demographic, and that it is not a big enough player to have had a material impact on revenues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum to the bill concedes there is insufficient data to determine the actual impact of lottery betting on state taxation revenue. Reductions in lottery revenue could be the result of a number of factors, including the growing prevalence of other gambling products, including online wagering services, for example. However, the explanatory memorandum otherwise maintains that any increase towards lottery betting and away from official lotteries would have a negative impact on states and territories funding community and other government supported causes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about why lotteries are special. Here I'd like to reflect on what Labor believes sets lottery betting apart from other forms of online wagering, of which there are a lot. Lotteries are a distinct product. They are heavily regulated and taxed, with around 60 per cent of every dollar invested back into the prize pool, and around 20 per cent going to state revenue. State and territory governments decide whether to issue lottery licences as monopolies. They do so based on analysis done by treasuries to develop what is most sustainable and what is in the best interests of the respective communities involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To illustrate, there was the move by the Victorian government to split the lottery licence in 2008, with a licence being awarded to Tatts for major national draw games and another licence being awarded to Intralot for instant scratch games, Keno and some other minor games. The splitting of the licence into two parts within the one market was a first in the Australian lottery industry. Years before expiry, Intralot surrendered their licence in Victoria and Tatts's licence was amended to add instant scratch-its and Keno from February 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian government has recently gone through a full licensing process and has decided to award a single operator licence to Tatts Tabcorp for 10 years commencing in July 2018. This is clear evidence that governments around the country know that a single operator model appears to be the most effective and best approach to maximising state returns. In 2016 the Queensland government considered whether they should issue two lottery licences. They concluded that it was not in the state's interest, and therefore renewed the monopoly arrangement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the community benefit derived from monopoly arrangements in lotteries has a long history. In New South Wales, the State Lotteries Office was established in 1930 to provide funding for hospitals during the Depression. Lotteries in New South Wales have been used in part to fund the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, and to finance Sydney's successful bid for the 2000 Olympic Games.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, Golden Casket originated from a patriotic fund to support war veterans and their families in 1916. The Brisbane women's hospital built in 1938 was completely funded by Golden Casket funding. Since it began, Golden Casket has always played an intrinsic role in helping the Queensland community. It was originally set up to raise funds for veterans of World War I, and the profits went on to fund many worthwhile projects across that state, from hospitals to baby clinics to the Queensland Performing Arts Centre and the Red Cross. Even the Gabba got its lights thanks to Golden Casket. In 1975, profits from Golden Casket were moved to a new cultural capital development fund. The money helped fund an extensive range of state-wide sporting, educational, arts and community projects—everything from the Queensland performing arts complex at South Brisbane to cultural centres in each local authority in Queensland, and even, as I said, the multimillion-dollar lights at the iconic Gabba sporting complex. Today, this legacy continues through programs such as Rainbow Kids and the Golden Casket Foundation and the hundreds of millions of dollars returned to government each year for use in worthwhile community initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, public lotteries generated $427 million in lottery taxation revenue for Victoria in 2015-16, and will generate approximately $4 billion over the full 10-year licence held by Tabcorp. Public lottery taxation is paid into the consolidated fund, and then to the hospitals and charities fund, and the mental health fund. In Western Australia, Lotterywest provided $265 million in charitable grants in 2016-17, providing vital funding for not-for-profit organisations and local governments to support charitable or benevolent purposes. In Western Australia, more than 30 per cent of revenue—that's $265 million—was poured back into the community in 2016-17 including $121 million for health, $15 million for sport, $15 million for culture and the arts, and $114 million directly invested into 764 not-for-profits and local government authorities. Similarly, in South Australia millions were returned to the community in 2016-17 including over $74 million to the hospitals fund and $140,000 to the recreation and sport fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, while online wagering companies may be taxed and may also return funds to state and territory revenue, these are calculated differently and amount to a great deal less than the taxation regime applying to the lotteries I've described. The logic is that by betting on the outcome of a lottery or increasing the number of lotteries, the fundamental product at the core, the lottery, is impacted. It is only by purchasing a ticket on a lotto that the lotto prize pool will grow. Labor acknowledges the logic of the monopoly nature of a lottery in the offline environment, and the potential impact on lottery betting in the online environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the impact on small business, which is one of the key concerns that's been raised in this debate. Newsagencies and other small businesses across Australia rely on the commissions from the sales of official lottery tickets. Over $350 million is earned by some 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agents across Australia. These businesses rely on this commission to earn an income and to cover the costs of running a business. The concern here is that synthetic lottery services entice customers away from these businesses with the promise of substantially higher jackpot amounts, compared to those prizes that can be offered under the official lottery draw. In 2017—and again following consultation with Labor—newsagencies and official lottery agents staged a public campaign, 'Lottoland's gotta go,' raising awareness of the negative financial impacts of lottery betting services. I know that some Labor members received and tabled petitions in support of the 'Lottoland's gotta go' campaign. In return, Lottoland—as is their right—has run a concerted campaign to argue their case for survival as a lottery betting agency. Amongst other things, Lottoland submits that their services do not undermine newsagencies and that this bill in fact will leave newsagents and small businesses worse off and exposed to monopolistic behaviour by Tabcorp. Lottoland has reportedly offered a profit-sharing partnership deal to newsagents to address small business concerns, whereby newsagents receive a share in the sales generated by customers referred to Lottoland. Negotiations, as we understand from reports, are in progress, with the Newsagents Association of NSW &amp; ACT, NANA, and VANA also in the mix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the explanatory memorandum concedes there is limited data available to quantify the financial impact on small businesses. Retailers operate across various business sectors, including independently owned grocery stores, pharmacies, petrol stations and newsagencies. However, any increase towards lottery betting and away from traditional lottery sales would have a negative impact on small-business revenues. Further, Labor notes that the state gaming regulators are exploring whether the aspects of these proposed partnership deals are in fact legal. Furthermore, Labor notes the concerns of the Australian Hotels Association, which indicated that it would reject any partnership deal with Lottoland and has emphatically asserted that Keno helps hotels support over 50,000 community groups at a grassroots level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the consumer impact. Concerns about state and territory impact and the small-business impact aside, there are also concerns about the impact on consumers. As I stated, in 2017 Labor formally requested that the ACCC undertake an investigation into representations made by companies that offer betting on lottery services, such as Lottoland, given the concerns that they may mislead or deceive consumers into believing they are purchasing a lottery ticket or directly participating in a lottery. The ACCC responded by undertaking to continue to review developments and any complaints received in relation to Lottoland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns around consumer awareness of whether Lottoland is an official lottery or a lottery betting service remain. This is despite the fact that Lottoland does state on its website that it is a bookmaker and not a lottery operator, and explains the term 'lotto betting' on its website. Official lotteries are heavily regulated to protect consumers—the harm minimisation component being paramount. There are guarantees that prizes are paid out to winners and are funded by the proceeds of lottery sales. Lottery betting services are not subject to the same regulatory regime as official lottery operators and can provide incentives to attract customers, such as paying a premium to guarantee a win rather than having to divide the prize equally between winners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the EM acknowledges that to date the department has not been made aware of or received any complaints from consumers who have indicated that winnings have not been paid out by a lottery betting service provider, it notes that the combination of wagering incentives and the offering of higher jackpots at greater frequency by allowing customers to bet on international lotteries would arguably encourage customers to engage with lottery betting services and away from official lottery draws. The intent, as I said, of the IGA is to minimise problem gambling, by limiting access to rapid-style interactive gambling services by Australians. While the act permits lottery draws, only a small number are conducted each week, whereas a much higher number of synthetic lottery draws occur around the world on a weekly basis, with much higher jackpots ranging to hundreds of millions rather than tens of millions, which could, as I said, lead to problem and at-risk gambling. Concerns around consumer awareness of whether Lottoland is an official lottery or a lottery betting service remain. Again, I note that this is despite the fact that Lottoland does state on its website that they are a bookmaker and not a lottery operator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate that Labor has long been on record with concerns about the impact of synthetic lotteries like Lottoland on Australian consumers and small businesses. These concerns prompted Labor to consult with a range of stakeholders. Labor has kept a watching brief on these issues for over a year, including the measures I've described that have been or are being considered by individual states and territories. Ultimately, as I said, it's the Commonwealth that has responsibility for online gambling and it's the Commonwealth that's best placed to implement a national framework in relation to lottery betting services. This would be consistent with the national consumer protection framework and the new credit betting system that came into effect in February this year. There is a genuine cause for concern that any increase towards lottery betting will be at the expense of consumers, small businesses, community and other government causes funded by official lotteries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it clear in closing that Labor notes that Lottoland is a legitimate service that pays tax in Australia. It is indeed a disrupter seeking to offer consumers greater choice in a gambling product. However, this is not the kind of disruption or choice that Labor seeks to support on this occasion. We also note that Lottoland is not the only provider of lottery betting in Australia. In addition to the number of current providers of lottery betting, we have seen the recent entry of a new player, myLotto24, on the scene. Labor shares concerns about the impact of the growth in lottery betting in Australia, and Labor will not oppose this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  The Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018 is indeed welcomed. A number of members have advocated for it, and I am one of them. I spoke in the House last October about the issues addressed in this bill, and I'm grateful that the government, under the leadership of the communications minister, Senator Mitch Fifield, has responded with this bill that we debate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legal gambling appropriately takes place in Australia, and should only take place, under a social contract. This bill represents a bid to ensure that the terms of that social contract are indeed met by all of the players all of the time. A key aspect of the social contract long employed in this country has been that taxpayers benefit from what is now a $24 billion domestic industry—at least that's the figure from the 2015-16 financial year. There was $24 billion wagered by Australians and, generally, taxpayers benefit. The revenue to the state from all forms of gambling in that 2015-16 year was just short of $6 billion. That's about 10 per cent of their total income via taxes, licence fees, levies and the like. Some of that money goes towards support programs for problem gamblers, but the bulk of it goes to essential services that benefit all taxpayers in the areas of health, education, infrastructure and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another big beneficiary of well-regulated gambling activity in this country is small business, principally by the sale of lottery tickets. Lotteries are an earner of $350 million-odd a year for some 4,000 newsagents, convenience stores, RSL clubs and the like that hold the appropriate state licence. This is very important income for those businesses. The states' share of lottery related gambling alone is over $1 billion a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is obviously income on a scale that neither governments nor thousands of businesses can afford to lose, but a growing proportion of it indeed is under threat, as yet another impact of the digital age and the new disruptive business models it has spawned takes effect. I refer especially to the business models of companies such as Lottoland, which have in some part prompted this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lottoland is a self-described international internet bookmaker. It is based in the tax haven of Gibraltar. It pays no taxes or fees here other than an annual fee of half a million dollars to the Northern Territory government, which enables it to operate nationally and which is a fraction of what it would be liable for in various taxes, fees and levies if it were Australian based. Via its online business model, it takes business from Australian small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Its principal product is the provision of access for Australian punters to what are effectively synthetic tickets in highly lucrative, and therefore highly attractive, overseas lotteries. They are typically significantly larger than anything available here domestically. Here lotteries offer, apart from the occasional larger jackpot, first division prizes of a million or maybe a few million dollars. Occasionally it is $20 million or a bit more when jackpots last for a while. There are overseas lotteries that Lottoland deals in that have first division prizes of half a billion dollars. US PowerBet, which Lottoland offers access to, recently had a top prize of well over $600 million. US Mega Millions is huge by our standards at $166 million. EuroJackpot, which is also offered, was recently offering $85 million. These are, obviously, tantalising sums to Australian punters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The company now boasts that it has around 650,000 Australian customers, from a worldwide base of over six million, which is extraordinary for a company that did not exist as recently as five years ago. It is a relatively new creature of the internet. The truth is, however, that despite popular misconceptions to the contrary, Lottoland does not, in fact, actually sell you a ticket in those megalotteries. You pick your numbers in exactly the same way as you do here, but Lottoland has no real connection with the organisations running the lotteries. The Lottoland product is, in fact, therefore, synthetic—a simulation, if you like, of the real thing. If you win a minor prize, Lottoland says it will pay you out of the revenue it has raised from selling its products, but it insures itself against the possibility that you might come up with the same set of numbers as the winner of the actual lottery. If in the highly unlikely event that you select the exact same numbers as the winner then Lottoland will call on its insurers to give you the payout, equivalent to what the lottery would pay out had you actually held a real ticket. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a heady business model—a model without the guaranteed prize pool of conventional established lotteries, a model that seeks to mimic the real thing, with almost identical marketing material and advertising, designed, one might assume, to confuse the consumer, everyday Australians, who might unwittingly transfer their confidence and product loyalty to this synthetic fake. Add to that, they pay, no doubt, little tax and—who knows?—maybe no tax at all in the country where they're based, the tax haven of Gibraltar. They avoid tax in the countries where they operate, made easy, of course, because they conduct their business online. And they make a lot of money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The losers in this business model, however, are more than just a majority of punters, whose odds of winning are only a tiny fraction of the already huge odds of winning in a domestic lottery. The states are losers. They miss out on vital income. The Commonwealth misses out on GST. Thousands of small businesses are losing as customers are being lured away from properly regulated conventional products, and this is a very real, a very significant problem. Small business operators in my electorate of Fairfax, and I'm sure in other areas right across this country, are losing an important part of their income stream. They are also suffering from a decline in customer traffic through their stores, which negatively impacts other non-lottery sales as well. Therefore, no part of that social contract that has been the Australian model for gambling for many, many years is being met. The clear danger is that the problem for governments and the problem for small businesses is only going to get bigger and quite exponentially bigger, one would think. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A signpost of note is the extraordinarily rapid growth of Lottoland from a standing start in 2013 to over six million customers globally today, with 650,000 based in Australia alone. Lottoland has, in just five years, soared—soared, indeed, comet-like. Even Lottoland says its business is growing and growing fast, which is a very fair description. It promotes the fact that sales in 2016 were 300 million euros, about A$480 million, just four years after start-up, and it rates as one of the fastest-growing companies in Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, if the synthetic lottery space were left unregulated, the number of Australians drawn into it would likely grow, and probably grow significantly. In the country with the highest per capita punting population in the world, there is a real likelihood that more Lottolands would sprout up online to employ the same business model and create even worse outcomes for the revenues of our small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In retrospect, maybe we shouldn't be surprised that this sort of behaviour is occurring. It's perhaps even predictable. But it was really only so in the imagination, certainly not in reality, when the Howard government began paying attention to developing threats posed by online gambling in 2001. This bill amends the Interactive Gambling Act 2001, which was prompted by the increased availability of gambling services that were beginning to emerge via the then relatively young internet. That act banned internet casinos, internet pokies, online scratchies and ball-by-ball sport wagering. More recently, we have outlawed credit betting online, but, at the time when the original act was developed in 2001, and indeed for more than a decade beyond, the sort of issue we now confront via this synthetic lottery business model simply did not exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amending bill adds to the original Howard-era constraints on online gambling, established by that 2001 act, by acknowledging and seeking to regulate recent innovation in this space. This bill effectively prevents any gambling service provider from offering in Australia a platform for the placing, making or receiving of bets on the outcome of Australian or overseas lottery draws—that is, synthetic lotteries. The bill also specifies online betting on the outcome of Keno games—which is also offered, by the way, by Lottoland—as another synthetic lottery variant captured by this legislation. Further, it signifies a delay in the commencement of the bill for six months to allow gambling operators and consumers time to adjust their business and betting practices respectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of this House will be aware that one of the prompts for this bill was a concerted campaign in support of these changes by the organisations of small businesses most heavily impacted through loss of income. Members may also be aware of a vigorous, well-funded campaign from Lottoland to frustrate this bill, defending what they perceive to be a simple case of innovative disruption, a legitimate business activity, especially in this open era of free trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the free trade argument, I will repeat what I said last October to this parliament when I called for the very action that this bill now delivers. I am not in any sense a protectionist. I have no problem—no problem—with overseas companies. I certainly do not object in principle to market disrupters, and I am very strongly in favour of free trade. However, my problem with the likes of Lottoland is that its business model is based on tax avoidance, and it defies a longstanding social contract in this country relating to gambling. While the veracity of this company in seeking a 12th-hour deal with the very small businesses it previously disregarded is untested, the clear reality is that, by basing itself in a tax haven, Lottoland and those that try to emulate it cheat the Australian taxpayer not simply by accident but by design, and I therefore unashamedly commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  Deputy Speaker, I'm sure you and many others in this chamber and across Australia have seen ads on TV for Lottoland. It touts itself as the latest market disruptor, advertising jackpots in the hundreds of millions and even into the billions of dollars. It offers the US Powerball's prizes of over $1 billion, the EuroMillions's prizes of several hundred millions of dollars as well as our local lottos. However, it operates more like a bookmaker than a lottery, taking bets on the outcome of the numbers drawn. While large prizes can be won in lotteries, the chances of winning them are extremely slim. For example, and by comparison, you have a one-in-76 million chance of winning division 1 in the Australian Powerball. You are much more likely to be killed by lightning—that's a one-in-1.6 million chance—or die from a venomous bite or sting, which is a one-in-one million chance. It's even harder to be bitten by a shark, but that's another discussion. Even smaller prizes can be harder to win, with a one-in-110 chance that you'll win a division 8 prize in the Australian Powerball. The chances of winning the jackpot prize in an overseas lottery of this nature are miniscule, with the odds usually less than one in 250 million.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lottoland and its like essentially exist in a gambling loophole here in Australia. On behalf of Australian consumers, small business and the entire community sector, Labor has long been on the record with concerns about the impact of these synthetic lotteries. These concerns prompted Labor to consult with a range of stakeholders for a period of time, including the newsagents' peak body in the lead-up to the launch of Lottoland's Gotta Go! campaign. I have consulted and engaged with my local newsagents in the electorate of Burt. In 2017 Labor also formally requested that the ACCC undertake an investigation into representations made by these companies that offer betting on lottery results, given the concerns that they may mislead or deceive consumers into believing that they are actually purchasing a lottery ticket or directly participating in the lottery that they describe. The ACCC said that it would undertake a continual review of developments and complaints in this area. Labor has maintained a watching brief over that time and we have seen some state and territory governments take their own steps to try and regulate or limit the way in which Lottoland and its like can operate within their jurisdictions. But the reality is that this area needs national regulation, and it is properly the place of the Commonwealth to implement a national ban through its powers in respect of online gambling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we've had legislation on interactive gambling since 2001. That does allow online lottery draws, and it has traditionally been the case that there have been only a small number of those conducted each week—typically seven; maybe one a day. Now we've seen that lottery betting services allow consumers to bet on the outcome of up to 25 lottery draws being conducted around the world each week, with the promise of massive jackpots rising up into the hundreds of millions of dollars, which can lead to a problem with at-risk gamblers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lottoland seek to be a disrupter and they say that they engage as a competitor to some of our existing lottery providers. They have said that they will engage with the newsagent community to make sure that newsagents are looked after, but the reality could not be further from the truth. I'm sure everyone is aware that, in order to buy a lotto ticket, you go down to your local newsagent or your lotto kiosk. These are genuine, local, small businesses in our community, and they employ quite a few people. If we take away and undermine their opportunity to sell those tickets by allowing people the opportunity to participate in grossly misleading online synthetic lotteries, what will happen? Fewer people who want to purchase lotto tickets will go to their local lottery kiosk or newsagent to buy one there. And whilst they're not doing that, they probably won't buy the daily newspaper as well—they're probably already not doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will undermine not only that small business but the capacity for those small businesses to provide local jobs. We know that youth unemployment is high right now, particularly in Australia. In the electorate of Burt, in Perth's south-eastern suburbs, it is very high. In some areas youth unemployment is close to 20 per cent. These small businesses employ young people. They also provide jobs for some of the older unemployed people in our country who also find it difficult to find work. So why on earth would we want to undermine that? We don't. That's why Labor and I support this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Allowing these synthetic lotteries undermines the capacity of state governments to gain revenue and tax revenue from the lotteries that are already running on a domestic basis in this country. I have spent a long period of my life thus far working with the community sector, particularly in Western Australia. In Western Australia, Lotterywest is a huge provider of funding to our community sector, providing millions and millions of dollars in grants, big and small, for capital and seed funding and funding for test programs in the community sector. That funding is vital. The fundamental reason that I have great concern about these synthetic lotteries is that their existence robs Lotterywest and similar schemes around the country of the revenue that they need to enable them to provide those grants that our community sector relies on to be able to replace their computers, to buy a new van, to take disabled children to events around the local community, to provide funding to get a pro bono referral service off the ground in Western Australia—to do all manner of things. Those are but a few examples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we continue to allow these synthetic lotteries to exist, the revenue that is available to Lotterywest and to other lotteries around the country will continue to dwindle. Of course, that obligation will fall back in part onto the state and in part onto the Commonwealth, but, at the end of the day, government won't be able to meet that demand. We have set up a system where we have allowed gambling to occur through our lotteries because we gain a community benefit, and that has been a good thing. But allowing these sorts of synthetic lotteries to continue will completely undermine the basis of that system. As some have remarked, buying a lotto ticket is simply a non-tax-deductible way of giving to charity. We want to keep it that way. We want to make sure we protect that. That's why we're opposed, and why I am strongly opposed, to synthetic lotteries. It's why Labor and I are very happy to support this legislation to ban them. It's why I tabled a petition earlier this year from my local newsagents seeking to protect their businesses, protect the jobs of their employees and protect our local community sector to make sure that they are all secure going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I go back into the community, people often come to me and say, 'Why is it that the government and the opposition can never agree? Why are oppositions always opposing just for the sake of being in opposition?' I can tell you that this is actually a classic example of the opposite. Sometimes I think people regard that as happening too seldom. But the reality is that when good policy frameworks are put forward, when there is a good reason to legislate and when the government gets the legislation right—which doesn't always happen—we do agree. Here is an example where we do and of how we can come to the table and work together across the parliament to make sure that we have legislation that will not only work but provide a community benefit by making sure that we don't undermine small business, don't undermine people's opportunity to get a job and don't undermine our vital community sector within this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from my involvement with local community groups in my electorate and throughout the state of Western Australia that the grants that are available from revenue that we gain from our domestic lotteries are vital to ensuring that those community groups get support. They support our community as a whole, whether it's because we've got buses to transport people around the community, whether it's because we're able to provide grants to get a seed program off the ground, whether it's because we're able to provide the opportunity for new or upgraded computer software or computer hardware that's required—even just to make sure that you can get some accounting software for our local community groups; it can be that small—or whether it's through the provision of office space for some of our community groups to operate from, such as our local community lotteries houses throughout the state of Western Australia. All of this becomes undermined if we don't have protection for this system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some may say that this is nationalistic protectionism, but what it's actually about is protecting all of the things that are important for our community, at all different levels. It's important that we do that. I think it's excellent. I was very happy to see that the government has introduced this legislation, but of course also that Labor is agreeing to this legislation. As I said, newsagents and small business owners who employee people throughout our community come to my office in my electorate and go to state MPs with legitimate concerns. They're looking at what's happening. They're seeing the advertising that I spoke about when I rose. They are worried—legitimately worried—about the ongoing viability of their businesses. It becomes essential that we make sure that we protect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often those on the other side like to say that Labor doesn't like small business and that we don't really care about jobs. This is a classic example of demonstrating the opposite. We, on our side of the chamber, always knew it was true. We are about supporting small business and we are about making sure that we not only protect jobs but create the opportunities for more jobs. This is legislation that we agreed to because it helps that in a vitally important way. That's why we support this legislation. We see the overarching community benefit, despite what some ideologues and economic global purists might say about it being a protectionist measure. At the end of the day, it's about making sure that we have the appropriate regulatory responses to make sure that we contain online gambling—full stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we protect those who are at risk with gambling, but it's also important that we protect small business, we protect jobs and we protect state revenues. I can tell you that, as a Western Australian, state revenues have been a huge problem in recent times. I can wax lyrical about that at another time. It's important that we protect the revenues for the states and it's important that we protect the revenues that provide the grants to allow our community organisations—our grassroots community organisations and our state-wide community organisations—to continue to do the great work in the communities across our country. I'll always stand up to make sure that occurs. That's why I'm very proud that Labor will support this bill.</span>

                    <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I'm very pleased to talk on the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018 and I'm very pleased to talk in support of small business. So many small businesses exist in my electorate, particularly newsagents. We all know that one of the customs in Australia is to have a punt. That's what Australians call it: having a punt. How often do you hear that, irrespective of whether it was on the battlefields of Gallipoli or the Western Front in World War I, the Birdcage at Flemington, the mounting yard at Royal Randwick or the two-up that we see at local RSLs on Anzac Day right around Australia? The colloquial phrase 'betting on two lizards walking up a wall' can generally be applied right around this great country. The Sydney Opera House, for instance, was funded by a lottery, and that's going back many, many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our traditional lotteries and Keno games are popular and are longstanding recreational gambling products. They are actually an important income stream for thousands and thousands of small businesses. I will stand up for small business in this House every chance I get. This includes our newsagents, pharmacies, pubs, RSLs and community clubs. They provide millions of dollars in tax revenue to every state and territory in Australia and, as we know, help to fund important community services and infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, public transport and roads. Every time a customer buys a ticket in an official lottery draw, a percentage of the ticket price goes towards supporting community services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lotteries are also an important part of the income stream for local newsagencies and post office agencies. These are small businesses run by great local people, and they support our local communities all over the country. Whenever a community group, organisation or sporting club—even our service clubs and emergency services groups, which do such a great job—needs a sponsorship or prize for something they're doing, perhaps a local raffle, where do they go in small communities? They go to those fantastic local small businesses like Broadwater News in Busselton; Minninup Forum Newsagency; Donnybrook Newsagency; Capel Newsagency; Dalyellup News and Lotteries; and the Centrepoint newsagencies. These are all places where you can buy a lottery pack, maybe for Mother's Day, which is coming up, and where perhaps your grandmother or someone who loves scratchies goes, perhaps even lodging a set of numbers for a work Lotto syndicate. This is all part of what Australians do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Official lotteries and keno games have been a part of the Australian product landscape in gambling for a long time and are well accepted and well understood by consumers. They know what they're getting. They know what they're buying and they make a conscious decision. In contrast, betting services like Lottoland are relatively new and less understood. They provide no benefits to the thousands of small business owners across Australia—those newsagencies—and no benefits to our local communities, particularly in rural and regional areas like my own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue with these forms of gambling is the light regulation that's imposed on these services. They can and do entice customers away from traditional lotteries, and this further impacts on the benefits to small businesses and the community more generally. Many Australians have voiced their concerns about these services. There are more than 4,000 newsagents and lottery retailers Australia-wide, and they depend on the sales of actual, real, well-regulated lottery products. Those products can generate between 50 and sometimes 70 per cent of their income, so we're not talking about a small proportion of their income stream. The viability of these businesses is really critical. Because of their online structure—Lottoland is based overseas, in Gibraltar, I understand—none of those Australian state or territory taxes are paid, unlike our real lotteries, which contribute over $1.1 billion each year. We see so many newsagencies that are part and parcel of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've received a number of petitions signed by people in my electorate who are concerned about the impacts. I've got so many pages of petitions from people in my community who share the concerns. They want to be able to walk down to their local newsagency and buy their tickets or get their scratchie—whatever they choose to do—and they want those businesses to still be there for them. In particular, a lot of our senior citizens love going and having that quiet little dabble, often each week. Recently I was at Centrepoint newsagency. They've got a 'lucky buddha' with coins across him, and I saw the amount of people who were rubbing their Lotto tickets across the buddha because they wanted the luck that went with it. Of course, that is what happens in a small, local, community newsagency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has listened to all of the people who have signed these petitions. It has listened very carefully. Last year, Minister Fifield raised these concerns with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory is so far the only jurisdiction to licence this form of lottery betting. The Northern Territory government has responded by introducing what is only a partial prohibition on this lottery betting, and the implication of this is that the betting can't be offered on Australian lotteries. This was a positive step, but the government believes stronger and more comprehensive action is required, which is what we see in this bill. And this bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018, will take decisive action. I can say to the newsagents who are watching and listening to this debate, those in my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia, that the government is taking decisive action. We understand your small business. We will amend the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and prohibit the provision of lottery and keno betting services to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said previously, traditional lotteries are heavily regulated and pay a considerable amount of tax to all states and territories. For every lottery ticket sold in those newsagencies and outlets, up to 28 per cent is allocated to state and territory taxes. Not only does that support the regulatory oversight and government services; but nine per cent is paid to the agents for relevant sale costs and income requirements. That's the heart and soul of these small businesses, and that's what this bill is about as well. An estimated $1.1 billion in state and territory taxes in 2016-17 is what has been and is at risk, plus those small businesses that add so much to our small communities. Over $350 million is earned by those 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agencies—the official lottery agencies—across Australia, from sales of an official lottery product. You're buying a ticket, you're buying a product, you're buying a scratchie. Newsagents, as we know, actually rely on this to run their businesses. This is a big part of their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional keno services that are offered in clubs and hotels also help support community services and sporting initiatives. It can be, as we know with Lotterywest in Western Australia, that they support so many small community groups. A number of times I have been to events where I have seen that one of the sponsors whose logo is on the sign, the pamphlet, the program or the advertising material is Lotterywest. This means they have contributed. I have seen how good that is and how important that is to so many groups and organisations. In Western Australia, Lotterywest support things such as supply costs, lease costs, administration and operating costs, travel costs and capital costs sometimes, depending on the project—all sorts of different projects. They want to make the community a better place. It's the funding that comes from people buying official lottery products that funds this for small communities. So, any time this is diminished, the whole of our Australian community suffers. Everyone in this place would want to grow our communities and support our communities and know that when they buy that ticket that that's exactly what they're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In direct comparison, lottery and keno betting services contribute significantly less tax and to only one jurisdiction in Australia. They don't pay commissions to small businesses at all. They are domiciled in overseas tax havens and minimise their exposure to domestic regulation. It's a deliberate decision. I understand that Lottoland has 650,000 Australian customers. So this is having a direct impact on each of our small businesses, our newsagencies. Lottoland doesn't actually sell you a ticket; you're betting on the outcome. This is really important. This will have an impact on Australian based lotteries. It certainly has an impact on small businesses. So this legislation is really important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lottery betting services aren't required to comply with the guaranteed prize pool model. Instead their major prizes are covered by insurance policies, and that allows lottery betting service providers to offer bigger prizes, more frequently, which further impacts on the financial benefits of traditional lotteries. Those bigger prizes are used to entice new gamblers, who aren't actually always aware of the difference between the two types of lottery products. They're not even aware of the protections and the benefits to the community provided by the products that are offered through the newsagencies and official outlets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This act will also minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia by limiting the types of interactive gambling services to Australians. Lottery betting services allow customers to bet on the outcome of up to 25 lottery draws being conducted around the world each week with the promise of massive jackpots up to hundreds of millions, which can lead to even more problem gambling by at-risk people. This bill will prohibit the provision of lottery and keno betting services to customers physically present in Australia. It will also prohibit the betting on a contingency that may or may not happen in the course of the conduct of a lottery, to ensure that bets cannot be accepted on the outcome or any aspect of a lottery or keno draw. The Commonwealth is responsible for online gambling matters and is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. Nationally consistent laws in this area are important. The government has really responded to the concerns of the community and has acted accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will also enable ACMA, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, to enforce compliance, which is good, and to respond to any complaints about lottery betting services being provided by other Australian or international operators, which is good as well. The government recently expanded ACMA's powers to take stronger action against the provision of illegal interactive gambling services to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians enjoy lotteries and keno as a recreational activity. If you go to a lot of clubs around the country you'll see the screens, and if you go to newsagencies you'll see the scratchies and the lotto signs. The government is absolutely committed to ensuring that online gambling takes place under a robust legislative framework with very strong consumer protections and within the boundaries of community standards. As I said when I started, I am always pleased to stand in this place and support Australian small businesses. They employ nearly half of Australians. Often those same newsagencies give young people their first job, and often they give people at a mature stage of their life potentially their last job. As small businesses, they are critical to the Australian economy and they're critical to our small communities, and I am always going to stand up for small business, as this government does in this country. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018. Today I stand with my Labor colleagues to draw a line in the sand to give greater protections to Australian businesses and consumers when it comes to synthetic lotteries. Labor has long been on the record with concerns about the impact of synthetic lotteries such as Lottoland and, in particular, their contribution towards problem gambling, which is something I want to highlight in the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to per capita spending, Australians are the world's most prolific gamblers, losing more money per person than people in any other developed country. Australians spend an average of $1,300 per capita on gambling, with the next highest being Singaporeans, at around $600 per capita. This is a growing problem and one we must all take very seriously as it reaches out to more and more people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Synthetic lotteries only contribute further to this epidemic. Total gambling expenditure in Australia has increased by 7.7 per cent, from $21 billion in 2013-14 to $22.7 billion in 2014-15, while per-adult gambling expenditure has increased from $1,171 to $1,300 in the same period. Numbers like these were part of the reason that Labor consulted with a wide range of stakeholders, including the newsagents peak body, in the lead-up to the launch of the Lottoland's Gotta Go! campaign, in consideration of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lottery-type games, such as Powerball or Oz Lotto, are already the most prevalent forms of gambling, with over 30 per cent of Australians participating. For many, this is a social activity, with the occasional dollar spent on having a go on the weekly lotto, but for some, this is quickly becoming an addiction. Studies have already proven that pathological gamblers are at an increased risk of developing stress-related conditions such as hypertension, sleep deprivation, cardiovascular disease and peptic ulcer disease. We know that people can quickly become engulfed by this addiction, and we must ensure all practical steps are in place to keep people from falling into this trap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, Labor formally requested that the ACCC undertake an investigation into representations made by companies that offer betting on lottery results. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEAY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  On indulgence, the greatest honour of my life was being elected as the member for Braddon in 2016. In my first speech in this House I said that the people of the West Coast and North West of Tasmania and of King Island are a resilient lot. Ours is a community that genuinely care for each other. We come together in challenging times, we're generous of spirit, we're always willing to pitch in and help one another. I chose to put up my hand for my community because of the need to stand up for workers, for pensioners and for those trying to make ends meet, which convinced me that they deserved a progressive voice in Canberra fighting for them. I'm also here to give my kids and kids right across my electorate the decent, secure jobs that they deserve in the beautiful part of Tassie they know and love. I want to make it very clear to every member of my community and every member of this House that I am not done working and fighting on behalf of those who sent me here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The citizenship issue has been a difficult time for my family, friends, supporters and staff and of course myself. It's been a character-building experience. But I can hold my head high for being upfront and honest with my electorate. I have nothing to fear or hide, you just need to look at my disclosure for that. I have been criticised for being too honest—a bit of an oxymoron for a politician, perhaps! People have commented that, while I don't have allegiance to the United Kingdom, perhaps I have an allegiance to my family. Well, if they are my flaws, then so be it. I'm a seventh-generation Tasmanian; a town in the Huon Valley bears my mother's family's name. I'm proud of my heritage from both my mother and father, as I would expect all Australians are proud of theirs. I have always been upfront about the fact that before nominating for parliament, I acted on the best available legal advice which indicated that I had satisfied the eligibility requirements under the Constitution as they have been interpreted for 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the High Court has set a new precedent. This is a new rule and I respect this rule without qualification. As a consequence of today's decision, I will be resigning from my seat as the federal member for Braddon. I will be writing to you, Mr Speaker, to advise you of my resignation. I will nominate for preselection to contest the election in the seat of Braddon. The people in my community deserve a representative that cares about them, respects them and listens to them. This is what I have done and what I will continue to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of the fact that one of the first things I was able to achieve after being elected was to successfully advocate on behalf of local farmers for an inquiry to get to the bottom of the floods that devastated the livelihoods and lives of my local communities. I am proud of the fact that my office has been able to assist hundreds, if not thousands, of people in Braddon. I'm proud of the fact that I have been the first member of parliament in my electorate in generations to take mobile offices to our outlying communities in the far North West and West Coast. I am proud of the fact that I've been able to advocate on behalf of our local fishers, farmers, miners, foresters and industry, our pensioners, and people who feel they don't have a voice. But I also know there is much more to be done. The people of Braddon deserve a government that invests in them and puts them first. That is what a Shorten government will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been privileged to have been given roles and responsibilities within the Shorten opposition caucus as the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources and secretary of the Labor caucus's Australian Jobs Taskforce. I want to thank my caucus colleagues for their unwavering support and mentoring, a united and awesome Labor team. I have been supported by a passionate Labor movement in Tasmania, party members, union members, and, of course, my staff, who go beyond what is required to support me and to help the people of my electorate. This has been hard on my family and has taken a personal toll on all of us, but we will keep fighting. This is bigger than us. It is about giving a voice to those who feel they don't have one. It's about helping people; that's why I am here. It's about making our region, as wonderful as it is, better and better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  On indulgence, the High Court's decision in the case of Katy Gallagher has changed the way the law is understood and interpreted in relation to eligibility under section 44 of the Constitution. Until today's decision, the 'reasonable steps' test had been accepted for more than 25 years in this country. It continues to be the basis of the Australian Electoral Commission's advice to candidates in the current candidate's handbook, and it was the guidance I followed when I nominated in 2016. The new interpretation of the law means the question of whether a person took all reasonable steps to renounce foreign citizenship simply doesn't exist, at least for dual Australian-British citizens. Irrespective of any administrative delay in the process, which can be considerable, it is generally between two and four months. Under the new interpretation, any prospective candidate must have their British citizenship deregistered before the close of nominations. In my case, that was effectively impossible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was endorsed as a late replacement Labor candidate in Fremantle on 12 May 2016. I completed the requisite UK Home Office paperwork to renounce my British citizenship on that day. I mailed the renunciation form and attached documents the following day, Friday, the 13th—not particularly lucky, as it turned out—using express registered post. I received confirmation that the documents had been received by the UK Home Office on Monday, 16 May, and the processing fee for renunciation was withdrawn from my bank on 6 June. On that basis, I nominated the following day, two days before the close of nominations. I received a letter from the UK Home Office subsequently, dated 24 June, saying that my British citizenship had been deregistered, with a copy of the renunciation form stamped on 29 June. I was elected on 2 July 2016 as the member for Fremantle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a difficult process. The people in my electorate have been good humoured about it. I attended a number of end-of-year functions. When we sang the Australian anthem and got to the bit where it said that we had boundless plains to share, there was an old Rotary representative next to me, and he clapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Lucky for you!' I have not served a single day as the member for Fremantle and as a member of this place as anything other than an Australian citizen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For what it's worth, I was born in London when my parents were on a working holiday. My mum was expecting me when they left Australia to travel to the UK, and I returned home with them at the age of one after we'd travelled around Europe in a Kombi van for six months—as you do. Both my parents were born in Australia. My great, great grandfather came to Fremantle as a convict in the 1860s. He had 13 children; it's a pretty big family tree. I think it's right to say that he is Geoff Gallop's great, great grandfather. I've never lived in the UK; I've only ever been there twice, in 1998 and 2012, for a few weeks each time. In any case, the High Court's new interpretation of the law has changed, and I respect that ruling. That means I will be writing to you, Mr Speaker, to advise you of my resignation in due course, and I'll prepare to contest the forthcoming by-election in Fremantle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't underestimate the impact of the interpretation that's been provided today; it will change the way the electoral system works in this country. For up to one-fifth of all Australian citizens who are or who may be entitled to citizenship of another country, it will mean that their ability to participate in federal elections will be significantly constrained. Any current dual British citizen who might think of contesting the by-elections that are about to occur would find that they are prevented from doing so under the current interpretation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I said in my first speech, I cannot imagine a more meaningful kind of work to do than to represent the community where I've lived virtually all my life. It's an incredible privilege to serve in this place. It's an incredible privilege to serve your community. It's actually a privilege just to be a Labor candidate on the ballot paper in the community where you live, and every opportunity I'm given to ask the people of Fremantle to trust me with the responsibility of being their representative in the national parliament is an opportunity I relish. I was looking forward to doing it in the general election. I was looking forward to doing it as part of an election that would see the creation of the next Labor government. But I'm happy to do it in the next five or six weeks and, then, again. And I'm looking forward to once again seeking that trust and responsibility over those weeks. I'm happy to be considered by the voters in my community in the Fremantle electorate on the basis of my character, my principles, my work ethic and my record.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  On indulgence, in February this year I explained in detail to the parliament, the people of Australia and, of course, the wonderful people in my electorate of Longman the steps I took to renounce any entitlement to citizenship through descent that I may have held. Today, a ruling made by the High Court of Australia has set a new precedent, giving a new interpretation of the reasonable steps test which has been in place for more than two decades. In light of this judgement, I'll be resigning as the member for Longman and I will recontest my seat in a by-election, because I am not done yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put up my hand to represent people who were just like me and to represent the workers in Narangba who rely upon a job—a good job, a secure job, a safe job with fair pay. I put my hand up to be a voice for parents in Morayfield with families who need schools that deliver an education that their children need and, of course, to stand up for affordable and accessible health care that the good people on Bribie Island and, in fact, every person in Australia deserves. After nearly two years of having the privilege of taking up this fight, I am not done. While there is $80 billion worth of taxpayers' money still going to banks and big businesses instead of to the pockets of people in Burpengary and Caboolture, I am not done. And while there is still a housing crisis, elderly people waiting for aged-care packages and an unreliable NBN connecting us with the rest of the world, I am not done—because in Longman, we deserve a government that's fair, a government that cares. And, just as I have done since the 2016 election and for many, many, many years before that, I will keep fighting, because I am not done. This is not a valedictory speech. Let me be very clear. I'm putting the government on notice that, while, ultimately, this decision lies in the hands of the amazing people of Longman, I intend to be back.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  Today's bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018, enables me to place on record the issue around synthetic lotteries. As I was saying in my earlier remarks, this only allows customers to bet on the outcome of a lottery draw without the need to purchase a ticket in the official lottery draw. Unlike official lottery draws, ticket sales do not cover major payouts. Instead, these are covered by insurance policies. A contingency would include the drawing of a particular number in a particular position or in a particular sequence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in recent times, on a state and territory level, governments have been clamping down on synthetic lotteries. These include the Northern Territory government, who introduced a prohibition on betting on the outcome of Australian lotteries. This was a welcome step, but it has not gone far enough to address some of the raised concerns. Elsewhere, South Australia does not permit lottery betting services, and it appears that this has been effective in stopping these services being provided to SA residents. The Tasmanian, Victorian, New South Wales and Western Australian governments are considering similar steps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear from these overwhelming movements by the states and territories that prohibiting lottery betting services is the right thing to do. But it's the Commonwealth that has responsibility for online gambling matters and is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. This would be consistent with the National Consumer Protection Framework and the new credit betting prohibition in the Interactive Gambling Act that came into effect earlier this year. The act is intended to minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lottery draws are permitted under the IGA, as there have traditionally only been a small number of draws conducted, with some seven draws conducted across the week, typically with a day's break in between. However, lottery betting services have now allowed consumers to bet on the outcome of up to 25 lottery draws being conducted around the world each week, with the promise of massive jackpots ranging up to hundreds of millions of dollars, which could lead to problem and at-risk gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, the growing disruption to traditional lotto betting services is having an increased negative impact, as we've heard in the debate today, on newsagencies and other small businesses across Australia. They rely on the commissions from the sales of official lottery tickets. Over $350 million is earnt by some 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agents across Australia. These businesses rely on this commission to earn an income and cover the costs of running a business, which include employing thousands of staff across the country. The concern is that synthetic lottery services entice customers away from these businesses with the promise of substantially higher jackpot amounts compared to those prizes that can be offered under the official lottery draw. What results is job losses and newsagents closing their doors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This enables me to put on record the great work of our local small business newsagents. I know that for each and every one of us, when we move around the community, often newsagents are the lifeblood and the heartbeat of local strip malls and shopping centres. They are sometimes run by local family businesses and they form a real, integral part of the local small business network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pleased to see bipartisanship on this matter, as we know just how much problem gambling we are seeing as an impact on Australian families. It's estimated that 200,000 Australians have a high-level problem with gambling, while up to twice as many more have difficulties at a lower level. There's a ripple effect where corrosive habits can impinge on friends and family. According to problem gambling experts and people from Monash University in Melbourne, we know that the numbers extend to the 650,000 Australian account holders who can gamble all too easily through their mobile phones and on synthetic lotteries like Lottoland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to quote Tim Costello from the Alliance for Gambling Reform, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just like the way online poker companies such as Pokerstars exited the Australian market after new federal legislation last year, Lottoland should do likewise rather than further deluging Australians with more gambling messages attempting to grow the dangerous online segment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly commend the shadow minister for communications, the member for Greenway, on her leadership on this issue, which will extend to give greater protections to businesses, consumers and all Australians from falling into the trap of problem gambling.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  I have considered the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018 in quite a lot of detail in terms of my support for it, because, of course, it includes lots of different measures, such as pathways that shut down the freedom of Australians to engage in some gambling activities. I do, and always will, take freedom very seriously; it's the core of who we are as a nation and the basis on which I sought election to parliament. But it's pretty hard to go past the reality of what happens in the practice of Lottoland's activities and whether those are proper within a well-regulated operation around competition, particularly in the gambling sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have challenges with parts of this bill, and I'm not trying to pretend otherwise, but when it comes down to it, we have a situation where people are using the opportunities provided through technology and the internet to subvert domestic competitive activity. Disruption, by itself, can be a very positive thing—in fact, it can be an extremely positive thing—but it still has to operate within a system of laws, taxes and regulations to make sure that consumers are not taken advantage of and that people are also meeting their responsibilities within a free society. That's the basis on which I support this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you have a company in Australia operating, as Lottoland does, against existing providers who carry the burden and the cost of regulation and of making a contribution to our tax system, and who are obviously integral in terms of the operations of many Australian small businesses—particularly newsagents of course, many of which I have in my own electorate, as many others do; though perhaps, I imagine, not as many as some have had in the past—we have to take appropriate measures to provide pathways for those who want to compete in that space to do so in a legal way and to match those responsibilities and burdens that other providers carry. This bill seeks to do that. It essentially seeks to provide—I'm very wary of using these phrases ordinarily—a level playing field for those who seek to run lottery activities and gambling activities within Australia by ensuring they match their responsibilities by paying taxation and by being well regulated. The bill also makes sure that we have proper competition within the marketplace that enables consumers to choose but not be taken advantage of simply through the use of technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important because sitting behind a lot of discussions around gambling are discussions around making sure we address and tackle part of the challenges of gambling addiction. One of the reasons we have tax obligations directly associated with different forms of lotteries is to make sure there's a surplus benefit out of that type of activity to support those who are most in need, and to make sure that people can't be taken advantage of where there aren't support services for people who feel they have a problem to get proper redress. This bill acknowledges that practical reality of the addiction that can occur with gambling and takes appropriate steps and pathways to make sure that we continue to provide the services for those people who are in need of assistance, particularly when it can have such a negative downward spiralling effect on people's lives. By taking such sensible measures in this piece of legislation, we're enabling a proper and well-regulated environment for gambling for Australian consumers to choose, something I believe very strongly in. We are making sure that we have an environment in which people can get the support and assistance they need to make sure that there is no chance of problem gambling turning into the consequences of a downward spiralling of people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, nobody is going to try and pretend that there's not an interest for government in this—there is. Of course, gambling revenue for state governments, in particular, is very important in terms of budget balance sheets. But in truth, it's largely got nothing to do with the justification for why this bill should be addressed and introduced. It's not just to stop the realities of gambling competition or disruption where it's appropriate and necessary, but it is appropriate to make sure we take legislative measures, particularly because of the challenges the technology presents us, to make sure that consumers are not taken advantage of and to make sure we have a proper and well-regulated system.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I'm on the record as an opponent of gambling in all its forms, both in my own community and in this place. My opposition began as a young man when I was re-roofing a TAB as a carpenter, many years ago. However, an extensive and powerful body of academic evidence exists which shows what a blight on our society gambling is, and for that reason I wholeheartedly support the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to problem gambling, in 2017 alone, Australians lost—if you're ready for this, Mr Deputy Speaker—almost $24 billion to gambling, according to the Australian gambling statistics collated by the Queensland government. As Dr Charles Livingstone of Monash University says, gambling is a public health problem. In terms of disability-adjusted life years, the impact of gambling is approximately the same as excessive alcohol consumption. Between 80,000 and 160,000 Australian adults suffer with severe problems from gambling. This equates to somewhere between 0.5 and one per cent of adults. A further 230,000 to 350,000 Australians, or 1.5 to 2.1 per cent of adults, experience moderate risks that may make them vulnerable to problem gambling. Although small in absolute terms, this means that as many as 30 per cent of regular gamblers are problem gamblers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all people who gamble have a gambling problem—I readily accept that—but, according to a 1999 Productivity Commission report, expenditures on gambling by problem gamblers constitute as much as 40 per cent of all money spent on gambling. In the case of electronic gambling machines—pokies—42 per cent of revenue comes from high-risk gamblers, with another 20 per cent from moderate-risk gamblers. This problem is highly regressive, with those on lower incomes and in disadvantaged populations much more likely to experience problem gambling and to spend a larger proportion of their income on gambling. Problem gambling works to entrench economic disadvantage and can contribute to its transmission between generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010 and 2012, in the Northern Territory and in New South Wales, separate studies demonstrated gambling impacts on Indigenous communities and identified greater negative impacts than on the non-Indigenous population, specifically with respect to poker machines. Studies focused on individual-level harms to the gambler have found that gambling is linked with financial problems, bankruptcy, increased likelihood of divorce, substance abuse, anxiety, depression and even suicide. There are far too many studies to list, but they include Black, Shaw, McCormick and Allen's 'Marital status, childhood maltreatment, and family dysfunction: a controlled study of pathological gambling'; another study entitled 'Young adults' gambling and its association with mental health and substance use problems', published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health</span>; and Kerber et al's 'The impact of disordered gambling among older adults', in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Problem gambling causes harms to the individuals themselves, but it also causes harm to those around them and, importantly, to the wider community. Each high-risk gambler impacts, on average, six other people. These can include spouses, children, family, friends and employers. Each moderate-risk gambler affects three others, and even low-risk gamblers affect an average of one other person. A 2013 Swedish study by Svensson, Romild and Shepherdson published in <span style="font-style:italic;">BMC Public Health</span> revealed that, in total, 18.2 per cent, nearly one in five, of the Swedish population reported having someone close to them who currently had or had previously experienced gambling-related problems. In that study, significant others experienced similar negative consequences and were significantly more likely, compared with the general population, to experience poor mental health, risky alcohol consumption, economic hardships and arguments with those closest to them. A 2016 Victorian study identified that postcodes with no poker machines were associated with 30 per cent fewer incidents of domestic violence-related assaults per 10,000 head of population. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond those individuals immediately linked to the problem gambler, gambling has huge impacts on our community at large. These include higher levels of crime, higher unemployment levels, lower incomes, lower expenditure in non-gambling local businesses and the diversion of resources away from more productive uses. A significant number of studies reveal that a large percentage of problem gamblers admit to having committed a gambling-related illegal offence—most commonly, theft, fraud, robbery, assault and breach of apprehended violence orders. These studies include 'The influence of gaming expenditure on crime rates in South Australia', which shows the contrast between areas with more and less gambling. A 2010 Victorian study examined the relationship between poker machine expenditure and various types of crimes. It found that there was a consistent, positive and significant relationship between gaming and crime rates, especially income-generating crime. Income-generating crime includes theft, fraud, breaking and entering, forgery, larceny and robbery. A further 2008 South Australian study concluded that electronic gambling machine expenditure was found to influence positively and significantly income-generating crime rates in local areas in South Australia. These studies identify that the greater the amount of money spent on gambling in a particular area, the higher that area's income-generating crime happened to be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a static problem. We know that, as the amount of gambling in a particular community increases, the amount of harm that is done to individuals and our society increases. A 2014 Australian study found that an increase in mean per capita monthly poker machine expenditure from $10 to $150 was associated with a doubling in the prevalence of gambling-related harm from nine per cent to 18 per cent in the adult population in the Northern Territory. US and Canadian studies in 1989, 2001, 2004 and 2006 found that the opening of casinos there led to a significant increase in crime, growing considerably over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues have become particularly important and widely discussed in my own community on the Sunshine Coast just in the past six months. This is because the Sunshine Coast Council, led by the mayor, along with the Labor state government, has been in active discussions with an international gambling corporation, NagaCorp, about the possibility of establishing a casino in the new SunCentral Maroochydore CBD development. I have campaigned strongly against this development, and I recently held a community meeting to discuss the plans for this casino. More than 300 people attended this event. When we took a vote at the end of the community forum, the room was unanimous in its opposition to a casino. At that casino forum, we were addressed by Dr Charles Livingstone, whom I've quoted earlier, from Monash University. We were also addressed by a previous superintendent of Queensland Police, Mr Chris Sang. Both of them gave us an understanding of the societal impacts caused by gambling, and Mr Chris Sang particularly addressed the criminal aspects that flow when a casino moves into an area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently submitted a right-to-information request to both the Sunshine Coast Council and the Queensland state government to learn more about the behind-the-scenes discussions, which have been ongoing, about this dramatic expansion of gambling in my own community. I'm awaiting the outcome of these requests; however, I've already heard from the state government, telling me that the request, as it stands, is too onerous, because there are 4,600 relevant documents. I'll have more to say about that later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this bill, both in my own community, in the electorate of Fisher, and nationwide—I am not naive enough to believe that we can wholly outlaw gambling. However, what I am seeking to do in Fisher, with respect to the casino in particular, is to prevent a huge and unwarranted expansion of the available avenues for gambling. As I've described, repeated studies show that, when you increase the amount of gambling in a community, you increase the amount of harm. That is what I want to stop by preventing a casino being built on the Sunshine Coast, and it is what this bill is seeking to stop nationally by prohibiting the new phenomenon of synthetic lotteries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The law allows lotteries in this country, but it strictly regulates them and limits their number and frequency. There are a small number of draws in Australia, and the total jackpots available are modest by world standards. These synthetic lottery products, less than two years in existence, are a huge increase in the scale and availability of gambling opportunities for those who want to take part in lotteries. Betting on the outcomes of lotteries worldwide allows individuals to take part in 25 separate draws every week, with jackpots in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, in just one US Powerball draw in 2016, synthetic lottery products in Australia gave Australians the opportunity, otherwise not available, to take part in a draw for $2.3 billion. These products allow people to purchase the equivalent of tickets for these draws from home and on their mobile phones, as opposed to being required to go to a newsagent, for example. In 2017, Lottoland admitted that its business was generating more than $1 million a week in sales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've seen, as awareness of these products grows, this hugely increased opportunity to gamble and the increased size of available prizes will inextricably link to more gambling harm. This bill is an important step, and I hope that the government will go further, in particular around gambling advertising in this country. This government should be commended for its actions last year to get gambling adverts out of live sports at times when they would be likely to be seen by children. That was a really positive outcome, and the government should be commended on it. But, as one of my constituents, Charles Hodgson, asked me on Facebook just a couple of days ago, 'What is the point of moving the betting ads from sports when they've just moved them elsewhere?' We've all seen the proliferation of gambling ads, particularly around our news times. I hope that this year we'll see action to prohibit sports gambling advertising on television entirely. We did it for smoking. I don't see why we can't do it for live sports betting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, in my electorate of Fisher, I will fight to stop the construction of a casino, because I know that, when you increase the amount and scale of the opportunities to gamble in a community, you increase the harm caused. I support this bill, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I'd like to thank all those in the chamber who've contributed to the debate on the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that online gambling takes place under a robust legislative framework with strong consumer protections and within the boundaries of community standards. Traditional lotteries and keno games are popular and longstanding recreational gambling products that provide millions of dollars in tax revenue to every state and territory in Australia and help fund important services and infrastructure for the community, such as hospitals, schools, public transport and roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of the Interactive Gambling Act is to minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia by limiting the types of interactive gambling services available to Australians. The Commonwealth is responsible for online gambling matters and is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. This is consistent with the important work being done to establish the national consumer protection framework. Whilst some stakeholders have raised concerns that this legislation could mean that only one lottery operator would remain in Australia, the fact is that these are matters upon which the Commonwealth does not have a view. State and territory governments, not the Commonwealth, are responsible for issuing gambling licences. State and territory governments determine the number and type of licences issued and the activities that can be undertaken. The Commonwealth's responsibility is limited to online gambling activities. The Commonwealth government, the Turnbull government, has formed the view that online synthetic lotteries and keno, which involve betting on the outcome of both foreign and domestic lottery and keno draws, are a gambling bridge too far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Traditional lotteries are built on guaranteed prize pools from ticket sales and are required to comply with strict audit and consumer protection measures. Unlike official lotteries, lottery betting services are not required to comply with the guaranteed prize pool model. Instead, their major prizes are covered by insurance policies. This allows lottery betting services to offer bigger prizes more frequently, which further impacts on the financial benefits of traditional lotteries. Over $350 million is earned by some 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agents across Australia from sales of traditional lottery products. Traditional keno services conducted in clubs and hotels across Australia help support community services and sporting initiatives. It is clear that a shift away from official lotteries would have a negative impact on small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians enjoy lotteries and keno as a recreational activity in the full knowledge that, win or lose, purchasing a ticket will contribute money back to the community. The government strongly believes that lottery and keno betting services undermine the longstanding community acceptance of traditional lotteries. With the number of lottery betting operators entering the Australian market increasing, it is now the time for the government to take action to minimise the adverse effects on customers and small businesses in the community. I call on all in the chamber to support the bill.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  During Youth Week I committed to presenting in the federal parliament speeches by young people in my electorate. There are 4.2 million amazing young people between the ages of 12 and 25 in our country. Narayan is just one. He's a 20-year-old student who came to Australia when he was 12 years old as a refugee from a Bhutanese refugee camp in Nepal, and these are his words: 'Often, we as young people hear our leaders refer to us as the future of Australia. If we are indeed the future, our leaders must stop seeing us in a tokenistic way. If we want to see a better Australian future, young people need to be included in everyday decision-making. Young people need to be heard and considered more seriously. It is incredibly difficult not to be passionate about changing the media culture when young people from diverse backgrounds are portrayed with negative stereotyping every day. It is incredibly difficult not to be passionate about mental health when one in four young Australians experience mental health issues. Who do we, the 4.2 million young people in Australia, share our concerns with? As a youth advocate in both multiculturalism and mental health, I want to be able to share my concerns and thoughts with someone who has the power to make the change. This is why young people in Australia want a minister for youth who is willing to include us in everyday decision-making. After all, it is the experience that we gain today from our involvement in decision-making processes that will help us learn and make better decisions, assisting us to become stronger leaders of tomorrow.' That is well said, Narayan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  While this budget is not full of handouts or bells and whistles—and that's exactly the way it should be—it really does deliver in my part of regional Australia. The small business $20,000 instant asset write-off has been extended. Late last year, Jenny Jensen, who owns AgBoss in Albury told me how she saved about $4,000 or $5,000 after writing off the purchase of a new air compressor valued at $14,000. There's also an extra $224 million over five years in new funding for agriculture. The personal tax relief announced by the Treasurer also recognises that people are working hard and want to see the benefits of an improved economy. Our local councils will be happy with more funding for the Building Better Regions Fund, Stronger Communities Program and local community sporting facilities. There's the Stronger Rural Health Strategy, which will deliver more doctors, more nurses and more allied health professionals over the next 10 years. There are an additional 500 Commonwealth-supported bachelor places for medical students studying in regional areas. I also know there's real optimism about the benefits of the new Murray-Darling medical school network, bringing an improved number to general practice doctors wanting to start their career in the country. For families with school leavers, there's more for country kids on Youth Allowance and extra Commonwealth-supported places to study at regional institutions. The budget continues the coalition's commitment for a stronger regional Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Alfred Gordon Johnson left high school at the age of 16 to join the Royal Australian Navy's communication branch, beginning his training as a telegraphist in 1940. His first sea posting was with HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span>, at a time when control of the Mediterranean sea was hotly contested between the Allied and Axis forces. He served in Singapore, Java, the Coral Sea, Guadalcanal and the Pacific theatre, earning the rank of petty officer. Gordon served alongside the father of former US ambassador to Australia John Berry, a young Marine at the time, helping to ensure his safe landing at Guadalcanal and in Papua New Guinea, for which John and his family were very grateful. Gordon was 19 years old when he fought in the battle of the Coral Sea. It was equally as important as Kokoda and Gallipoli and stopped the Japanese from invading Port Moresby by sea. Mr Johnson was a telegrapher aboard the light cruiser HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span> during the battle of the Coral Sea and the Guadalcanal actions, which saw ships from the United States and Australian navies take on the Japanese between 4 and 8 May 1942. During these campaigns, Gordon filmed and photographed life at sea using personal camera equipment, preserving an enduring visual record, later shared with the Navy's Sea Power Centre, which now forms part of the Royal Australian Navy's historic reference collection. Gordon Johnson died on 27 April this year. His funeral is today and, in amazing symmetry, former ambassador John Berry will be delivering the eulogy for Mr Johnson today. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The North Sydney electorate is home to hundreds of community organisations that work to improve the lives of others. Today I want to acknowledge the work of Gig Buddies, a wonderful organisation funded by ACL Disability Services, which has its base in Chatswood but a reach that extends into the lives of people across our city. Gig Buddies is a not-for-profit organisation which supports people with learning disabilities and autism. Its model is simple but unique. It was founded on the principle that those with mild to moderate learning disabilities or autism should have the opportunity to experience the joys of seeing live bands, theatre sports and other activities. In short, they should be able to have fun and live life to the fullest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet for many this is difficult. Formal support programs are often daytime based, and the chance to participate in the type of experiences I have mentioned can be limited. Gig Buddies steps in and matches volunteers with clients, based on their shared interests and passions. Volunteers commit to taking the person they are paired with to at least one gig or event each month. I know Gig Buddies has proved incredibly important and of value to both its clients and volunteers. Gig Buddies has been a success because of the support given by hundreds of volunteers and the dedication of its small staff, led by CEO Carol Smail. They provide a service that makes sure those with a learning disability can experience all that most of us take for granted. I congratulate them on their incredible work.</span>

I was delighted to recently hear from seven young Australians on the stage at the Randwick Town Hall for the Autism and Me event on 29 April. From the speakers, a consistent message emerged that autism shapes a life and shapes experiences, but it's not a life sentence. I want to congratulate Carlito Green, Noah Finnane, Teo Tissue, Richard Habelrih, Jessica Disalvo, Simon Parkes and Marissa Ely for sharing their dreams and aspirations and highlighting their abilities. We need to hear from more Australians with autism, young and old, so more opportunities in employment and society emerge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to Randa Habelrih and Marissa Ely for launching the Autism and Me event. It's a positive platform and a voice for inspiring young Australians like her son Richard. Randa has worked for many years, in our community and across Australia, as a strong and powerful advocate for the rights of those living with disabilities, particularly those with autism. I hope that this Autism and Me event can expand throughout Australia so all Australians can see the great aspirations and dreams of those living with disabilities in our communities.</span>

It's so important because: it will bypass 15 sets of traffic lights; 7,000 trucks and 74,000 cars will be taken off local roads each and every day; there will be better freeway access; and it will even save 450,000 tonnes of CO2. But Labor and Mark McGowan in WA are refusing to take that $1.2 billion to get this vital project done. They have the ability to access those funds, and the feedback in my office from the people of Tangney and the people of Fremantle is that they want that road built. I've campaigned against the noisy protesters. I know the community wants that road built. Labor must work with the federal government to access the $1.2 billion that's there, in black and white, to get this project done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Yesterday's budget cut another $127 million from the ABC. Since this government came to power in 2013, it has cut $381 million from the public broadcaster. That's $381 million less for news and current affairs, children's broadcasting, Australian drama production and specialist programs in the arts and sciences. I am most concerned by the impact the latest cut could have on the ABC's coverage of rural and regional issues which affect my electorate. These cuts hurt, and they are designed to hurt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lessons of this Liberal government are clear. You can rip off your customers. You can forge their signatures. You can charge fees for services not asked for and not delivered. You can even charge dead people. You can do all this and the Liberals will still reward you with a $17 billion tax cut. But what you can't do is upset the Liberals. You can't report news they don't like. You can't air opinions they don't agree with. Do that and they will punish you. They will make you pay. I am proud to stand up for the ABC. It does a wonderful job in Tasmania on a shoestring budget. But now, more than ever, we need a strong, trusted and independent public broadcaster.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  When we announced $390 million last week to pay half the cost of upgrading the North Coast Line between Beerburrum and Nambour, which is owned and operated by the Queensland state government, the Queensland Treasurer Jackie Trad told her parliament that she would wait to see what was in the federal budget for the whole of Queensland before deciding whether or not to accept our offer. The federal budget has now been delivered and Queensland are winners big time. Twenty billion dollars is going to Queensland for infrastructure, including $5.2 billion for new projects.</span>

I believe this is one of those times. I've been buoyed by the level of goodwill and cooperation between the Queensland state government and the federal government in exploring the possibility of fast rail between the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane. My hope is that that same spirit of cooperation, that same goodwill, will apply when it comes to this upgrade of the North Coast Line between Beerburrum and Nambour. Therefore, I call on the Queensland state government to work with us. I call on them to get on board.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I want to give a shout out to the more than 100,000 people who rallied in my electorate of Melbourne today in support of the campaign to change the rules. They know that the economy is rigged, that our workplace laws are broken and that this budget, with its attack on our progressive tax system, will make inequality worse. The gap between the rich and the rest is growing, and the government's tax cuts will make inequality worse, because tax cuts are hospital cuts, tax cuts are school cuts, tax cuts are welfare cuts, and tax cuts will leave a vulnerable, unsustainable budget that will fail to tackle the big issues. These tax cuts are skewed to the top end. Someone on $50,000 will get $540 a year, but someone on $200,000 will get a whopping $7,225 extra a year, and millionaires will get it too. The tax cuts will give away $120 billion, primarily to the wealthy and the big corporations. Yesterday, thousands of people took to Twitter, opposing the tax cuts, saying 'You can keep my $10 and spend the money on government services and investment instead.' One of my favourites was from the ACTU leader, Sally McManus, who said, '#keep my $10 and stop neoliberalism.' The Greens are here to stop neoliberalism, and I know that the thousands of people who rallied today in my electorate are too.</span>

I acknowledge everyone that has helped me to achieve this, particularly my local regional newspaper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gympie Times</span>. The editor, Shelly Strahan, was of great assistance, and her predecessors, Michael Roser, Nev McHarg and Craig Warhurst, have been campaigning for decades to achieve this piece of infrastructure. I also thank everyone who contributed to a special book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Case for the Cooroy to Curra Section D</span>. The book contained a report from Scott Rowe and letters from Sergeant Steve Webb, Michael Roser and Nev McHarg, Craig Warhurst, Shelly Strahan and Carly Walker. It is a great pleasure. We know that the Labor Party did initiate section B to go around the Traveston dam. And what a disaster that was!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other than that, they've had nothing to do with this project. Indeed, it took a coalition government to save lives on this road, something that the opposition would have no idea about.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I rise to bring to the attention of the House the sad passing of Mr Graham Borgges, affectionately known as Mr B, who sadly passed away last night. Mr B was a true Oxley legend. He had been treasurer of the Oxley Otters Swimming Club since the 1980s and made an incredible contribution beside his late wife, Sadie, over many decades, helping and supporting kids in swimming. The Otters swim club summed it up earlier today, stating: 'It is with deepest sadness that we regret to inform our club members of the passing of Mr B last night. He was a pillar of our club and an icon of the Oxley community and will be greatly missed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see just how much Mr B meant to the Otters swim club and how much he was loved in our community by looking at the comments on the club's Facebook page in just a few hours today. In 2010, the swimming club grandstand was named in his honour. When the club suffered under the 2011 floods, he was there day and night, even though his own street and suburb were inundated. He had also been a continuing member of the Oxley State School P&amp;C for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr B was very generous with his advice and time for me in my roles as a councillor and as a federal member of parliament. Mr B, you're a hero to our community. We value everything you did for our kids. I know my thoughts and the thoughts of many Oxley community members are with his family, his children and his grandchildren. Rest in peace, Mr B.</span>

Beef Australia 2018 officially opened today, and two of our members from this House will be there to open the show. It was a wet start on Monday. It unofficially opened on Sunday. There was a wet start, but it didn't deter 25,000 people from coming through the gates. Country people just love rain. It's Australia's biggest beef expo. It'll go from 6 to 11 May. 2018 marks 30 years of beef week. It's held triennially. There are 40 countries and 90,000 delegates. Beef contributes about $75 billion to the economies of Central Queensland. The federal government has kicked in $3 million for the event. There are three cattle competitions involving 4,300 cattle, with over 2,000 in stud events, 1,700 in commercial cattle and 158 carcass entries. It will well serve the trade for the fair exhibitors.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  Once again Canberrans were bracing themselves for last night's budget, and once again they were kicked in the guts by the Turnbull government. Once again they've been attacked and insulted by yet another budget dominated by cuts to the Public Service, next to no investment in infrastructure, and complete and utter contempt for our nation's capital. There are more cuts to the Public Service. Last year we lost 2,000 jobs. This year it's 3,500. There are more cuts to our national institutions. Last year the attack was on the Australian War Memorial and the National Archives. This year the National Archives has again lost more staff, and the National Library has also lost staff. We've got cuts to education, to hospitals, to TAFE and to the energy supplement for pensioners.</span>

Last year, the infrastructure investment here in Canberra and the ACT, the nation's capital, was 0.004 per cent of the national budget. Guess what it was this year: the princely sum of 0.2 per cent of the national infrastructure investment budget. Once again, Canberra has been kicked in the guts by the Turnbull government in this budget, and it is again under sustained attack.

What many may not know is that my home town of Mount Gambier is where the academy is based. Mount Gambier is also home to one of the largest jazz festivals in Australia, Generations in Jazz. Thanks to the event and to James Morrison's academy, Mount Gambier is a global jazz hot spot. Forget New Orleans; last weekend Mount Gambier was the place to be for international jazz fans.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Generations in Jazz is so named because not only does it attract jazz legends of today but it also brings together tomorrow's jazz stars. This year's Generations in Jazz saw over 5,000 students from 128 schools converge on Mount Gambier for the weekend. They were joined by globally renowned acts The Cat Empire, James Morrison, Jeff Clayton, Patti Austin, Nasrine Rahmani, and Shannon Barnett. Set in the middle of a paddock, the 6,100 seat big top pavilion hosts the stage band awards, individual jazz and vocal scholarships and the daily concerts from the more established jazz legends. It's the ultimate jazz jam session. On the outskirts of our Blue Lake city the event attracts thousands of people, the majority of whom are performing themselves. It's a unique and spectacular event, something that fills me with pride as a local. The event would not be the success that it is year on year without the hard work and dedication of the organising committee and the hundreds of volunteers that help everything run so smoothly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I rise to update the parliament on how this budget turned out for the good people of the Northern Territory, in particular the Top End. Unfortunately, what became incredibly clear as last night rolled on is that it's a budget for the top end of town, not for the Top End of Australia. In fact, all we were offered was a road that was re-announced from previous budgets. But the cuts are still there: a $15 million cut to CDU and a $16 million cut to our public hospitals—thanks very much. And we still don't have a city deal for Darwin. In the budget Western Sydney got a city deal. Tasmanians are happy down in Launceston—they have a city deal. But there is not only not one dollar from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility but not a dollar for a city deal for Darwin. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not happy about this, obviously. We're not happy that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said: 'Corporate tax cuts, you beauty—$80 billion for corporate organisations, including $17 billion for the banks'. That $17 billion for the banks is taken away from schools. Schools in Palmerston and Darwin could really do with that funding so they can prepare Territorians for the jobs of the future. We're not happy, and I'm inviting Territorians to have their say at the Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival on the weekend. </span>

One of the biggest challenge facing men's mental health is getting those who need help to seek that help. As we know, they are traditionally a group who try to hide their illness and deal with it themselves. This exhibition seeks to normalise the behaviour of seeking help by using normal men to tell their stories—from father Michael Traeger, who tragically lost his young wife only two years ago, and Sean Tosold, who has shared his battle with depression and child abuse—both from Cummins—to the most prominent citizens, like Port Lincoln Mayor Bruce Green and the state member for Flinders Peter Treloar, and 26 other men who contributed. We thank them for offering their time and commitment to this program. We especially thank Jo Clark from West Coast Youth &amp; Community Support, whose idea it was. She said it came to her at two o'clock in the morning. I thank the photographer Robert Lang for giving his time to this project and putting on such a good display. The exhibition will be touring 10 Eyre Peninsula towns highlighting the importance of resilience and self-empowerment. I congratulate all involved. </span>

Detour House provides up to 15 months support to young adult women recovering from drug and alcohol dependency and other complex problems, while also providing support for independent housing transitions after a stay at the house. Since 1975 The Girls Refuge, based in Leichhardt, has cared for over 200 girls at a time aged 13 to 15, either on site at the refuge or within the local area. The refuge helps girls who are at high risk of homelessness due to family breakdown, domestic and family violence, trauma, abuse or other problems related to drug and alcohol misuse or problems with mental health. The refuge is a supportive home-like environment where the girls are able to receive assistance to stabilise their lives. I'm pleased to be supporting these organisations at a fundraiser on Monday, 11 June 2018 at the Leichhardt bowling club. The main attraction is a performance by the Day Street Band, a group of musos from Day Street, Leichhardt, who will give up their time, as they have for the last few years. I'll be providing a bit of support at the event, DJ'ing as the warm-up act to support these women and girls— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  What a fabulous budget we heard last night! The Turnbull government is getting on with the job of helping hardworking Australians, families and senior citizens. We're making sure that Australians keep more of their hard-earned money in their pocket. We're lifting tax brackets to ensure that wages aren't eaten up by higher taxes because people choose to work overtime or simply get a pay rise. In my electorate on the northern Gold Coast, an incredible 73,000 taxpayers will be better off next financial year. That is seven out of every 10 adults working in my electorate. I can't emphasise that enough. Over 70 per cent of the hardworking people in my community will have more money in their hip pocket to take home to their families because of this government and the budget they heard last night.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just tax relief. We're also implementing the National Energy Guarantee to ensure that Australian families and businesses can have affordable and more reliable electricity. We're making child care more affordable and accessible to those parents who want to work. We're backing enterprise through small- and medium-business tax relief. There are 21,480 small local businesses in my community that employ and pay their staff. They'll now have more money to spend and invest in their community. We're protecting peoples' superannuation by stripping away excess fees. We're tackling the black market economy. This is a real and sensible budget for my community on the Gold Coast.</span>

But, yesterday, they came in here and cheered as the Treasurer delivered a budget which is delivering $80 billion worth of tax cuts for the big end of town.

They talk about the importance of infrastructure, but, if you look in the budget, there's not one new dollar for infrastructure throughout the country. It's not all been bad news, however.

I'd like to thank them for being able to invest in infrastructure—in particular, the Shoalhaven River bridge. It has been a questionable project for a number of years.

                  </a>  The Treasurer advises that the cost of the unlegislated tax relief for business is $35 billion and the cost in the final year, which is outside of the medium term—figures for which were given at the last budget—is just under $10 billion. What the Labor Party are demonstrating in their questions and the reference to an $80 billion figure—they've simply added $15 billion to $65 billion; it has no financial basis—is that their plan is to repeal all of the legislated tax cuts for Australian business. What they want to do is not simply oppose the unlegislated tax cuts for larger businesses but repeal the tax cuts for Australian family-owned businesses of up to $50 million turnover, which employ 6.8 million Australians. That's what Labor wants to do: undermine the investment, the optimism and the entrepreneurship that are driving the record jobs growth we've seen—415,000 jobs last year—and the strong economy that is enabling us to deliver the outcomes for Australian families. Ten million Australians will receive tax relief from the Treasurer's budget, and we will move to a personal income tax system that is simpler and fairer. All of that is only enabled by a strong economy, and the Labor Party wants to pull the rug out from under that stronger Australian economy by abandoning Australian family-owned small and medium businesses, as every question they've raised indicates.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:03</span>):  I thank the honourable member for his question. Last night the Treasurer handed down the budget—a commitment to the values and the plan we took to the last election, in 2016. It is a plan that delivers on those commitments to drive a stronger economy to support Australian business and to support Australian jobs. It will deliver tax relief for small and medium businesses, which employ more than six million Australians; record investment in hospitals and schools; more affordable childcare; more affordable medicines, so many of those medicines are life-saving medicines; the roads and rail to get Australians home sooner and safer and bust congestion; and, of course, all of the resources that our vital services need—schools, education, health, the PBS and Medicare. That is all enabled by a stronger economy with more jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my previous answer, we cannot forget that last year we saw record jobs growth—the most jobs created in Australia in our history—and we're continuing to see a thousand jobs added every single day. None of that's happened by accident. The opposition would have us believe that Australia has grown simply because the global economy has. We have made our own luck. Australians have made their own luck. Remember, in 2011-12, when Labor was in government, when global economic growth was stronger than it is today, when commodity prices were much higher than they are today, Labor trashed the budget with one bigger deficit after another because of their addiction to spending. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is you need to have the policies that enable you to take advantage of a stronger global economy, and that's what we have put in place. It means we can guarantee the services Australians rely on and we can return the budget to balance sooner, and what that means is that we will not be throwing a growing mountain of debt onto the shoulders of our children and grandchildren. Net debt peaks this year as a share of GDP, turning the corner on debt. Labor sent us down a dangerous road on debt, and we have now turned back in the right direction to ensure that we bring the budget back into balance and bring that mountain of debt down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget the Treasurer delivered last night delivers tax relief for working Australians so they can keep more of the money they earn, their money. An average income earner will have $530 in their pocket from next year. For a family—two parents, two income earners—that's over a thousand dollars. That is a great support for that family in these times of rising living costs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The medium-term cost of the unlegislated component of the enterprise tax plan, which is currently before the Senate, is $35.6 billion over the period from 2016-17 to 2027-28. That is the measure that is currently before the Senate. The last year of that 2027-28 program is $9.8 billion, which obviously includes the cost of that measure as it applies economy-wide. So I will let the shadow Treasurer add up, if he can. But the point is this: the costings I have just set out are for the unlegislated tax cuts. Those opposite would know that, once a measure is legislated, it's legislated. It begs this question, as to why they want to know—why would you want to know the cost of tax legislation that has already been legislated for small and medium sized businesses unless you wanted to reverse it, unless you wanted to rip away the tax cuts given to small and medium sized businesses in this country? I'll tell you: $25 billion is the cost to revenue of those legislated tax cuts for small and medium sized businesses over 10 years. And you will be out $25 billion unless you reverse those tax cuts in your plan, because you went to the last election, beating your chest over there, the great man from McMahon—he was going to reverse the whole enterprise tax plan. You be honest with the small businesses—through you, Mr Speaker—and you tell them: are you going to rip away their tax cuts that have been legislated by this parliament, or are you going to strip them away?</span>

Fantastic job, member for Forrest. She stands up for her electorate to ensure important critical infrastructure will get built. That is funded by a stronger economy and a government that knows how to live within its means. The Bunbury Outer Ring Road will get built, thanks to the member for Forrest. The budget I handed down last night is a plan for a stronger economy. The economy Australians will live in, in the next 10 years, is what will determine their choices and their opportunities. It is important that we go into this next decade with a budget that's back in balance, a budget that has turned the corner on debt, and a budget that has taxes under control and has spending under control. It is important that there is a strong plan to ensure a stronger economy for Australia. That's what this budget is about. You cannot support and guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on unless you're doing the hard work of building a stronger economy. The businesses of this country, the employees of this country and the Turnbull government are doing that to provide that stronger economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan that I announced last night, the Turnbull government's plan for a stronger economy, is to provide tax relief to encourage and reward hardworking Australians and reduce the cost pressures on households. It is to continue backing business to invest and create more jobs. As the Australian Bureau of Statistics have demonstrated and found in their records, more than 1,000 jobs a day were created during the past year, creating more opportunities for people to go from welfare into work. The best form of welfare is a job. We are guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on: Medicare, hospitals, schools, caring for older Australians, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That is the Turnbull government's stamp of guarantee, because it is a stamp of guarantee of a stronger economy—which those opposite wouldn't know the first thing about.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />It's a plan to keep Australians safe. It's only a coalition government, it's only a Liberal and National government, which knows how and has the demonstrated track record of keeping Australians safe; of stopping the boats and keeping them stopped; of hunting down criminals; and of stopping terrorism and preventing the terrorist threat to this country—under the keen stewardship of the Minister for Home Affairs, keeping Australians safe, and of the Minister for Defence, ensuring that our overseas forces get the support they need. Above all, we on this side of the House, the Liberal and National parties, know how to live within our means, keeping taxes under control and keeping spending under control. We all know that too much tax is never enough for those on that side of the House. Their taxes can never keep up with their reckless spending. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

She's always been very keenly interested in the economy. I will repeat for the House: it's fairly straightforward: the final year cost in 2027-28 of those measures is $9.8 billion. Let me provide you with some additional information. In the 2017-18 budget, the major bank levy was proposed to raise around $1.8 billion in 2023-24 and cumulatively around $10 billion to 2023-24.

By the time that the major banks in this country would receive a corporate tax rate of 25 per cent, they will have paid, in the bank levy, more than $16 billion back to the government.

Prime Minister, as you know, my community has benefited from 38 new towers under the Mobile Black Spot Program, and you tell us that the government's role is to develop a long-term plan. My question is: what is the long-term plan to deliver mobile phone coverage to regional Australia? Unfortunately, the budget overlooks the challenge of mobile connectivity in regional areas. There's no commitment for future rounds of the Mobile Black Spot Program. So, Prime Minister, what is your message to the 200-plus communities in Indi and the rest of regional Australia that will be forced to go without this essential service?</span>

The government understands very keenly the importance of mobile coverage in regional and remote areas, and that's why we've delivered $220 million to fix those black spots. I remind the honourable member and other honourable members that, despite being in government for six years, the Labor Party did not spend a single dollar on improving mobile coverage—not one dollar in six years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A total of 502 base stations have been completed across rounds 1 and 2 already, with more stations under construction and on the way. I'm pleased to advise the House that the outcomes of round 3 were announced last month, and so that will see the delivery of an additional 102 new mobile base stations. The honourable member is thrilled that her electorate of Indi has been a big beneficiary of the program, with 26 towers completed across the electorate and 12 more on the way. That's over $8 million in federal government investment and a total investment in her electorate in these towers of $34 million.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also advise the House that the Regional Telecommunications Review has been brought forward, and the minister has asked it to hand down its recommendations to the government before the end of the year. The outcomes of the review will show how regional communications look in the future. It will provide direction on where we need to focus our efforts to ensure contemporary communications in regional and rural Australia. So we're committed to fixing the mobile black spots. I want to congratulate the ministers—Senator McKenzie and Senator Fifield—for their strong leadership in delivering more towers and more coverage right across the country.</span>

He is a tireless worker for his community, ensuring in this budget essential infrastructure that is supported by a stronger economy. It is congestion-busting infrastructure, infrastructure going into Victoria. And I have no doubt that the member for Corangamite would also be pleased to see these important projects, as she is to see the Avalon airport, which we've also announced in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget we have announced real tax relief for Australian families and working people in this country who pay taxes. We have done that through a seven-year plan that is affordable, that is costed and that provides genuine certainty for Australians as to what economy they'll be working in over the next 10 years and the tax they will pay. More importantly, when they put in the extra effort and go the extra yard they will be able to keep the proceeds of their extra effort. That plan involves, in its first step, delivering to middle- and low-income earners up to $530 every single year as part of their additional tax refund. If it's a dual-income family on average incomes, that's more than $1,000. For a family in those circumstances, that's half the year's electricity bill; that's filling the tank on about 10 occasions; that's paying for the kids' school books and uniforms—doing all of these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some on the other side who snigger at it, demean it. The member for Sydney particularly was sniggering at it the other day. She must be really in touch with Australians out there who are working, when she thinks $530 is to be discarded and means nothing to working Australian families in this country! But that's the tax relief that we're delivering as a government, because we understand that it's important that Australians get that relief now. Those of the almond-latte set don't think it matters. On that side of the House they just rip into their smashed avocados and say it doesn't matter. But on this side of the House we know it matters, and that's why we've provided for it in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But on top of that, we are acting to remove the impact of bracket creep over that seven-year tax plan and simplify the tax system in this country, which will mean that 94 per cent of working Australians who are paying taxes in this country will face a marginal tax rate of no higher than 32½ cents in the dollar. That plan needs to be legislated. The Labor Party will find any excuse not to give Australians tax relief. We'll look for every opportunity to give them that relief.</span>

In the first 15 minutes of this question time, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, in the Senate, have all refused to say the single total cost of corporate tax cuts over 10 years from 1 July 2018, both legislated and proposed to be legislated by the government. So, Prime Minister, what is the total cumulative number—specifically, what is the total cost—of corporate tax cuts over 10 years from 1 July 2018, both legislated and proposed to be legislated by the government? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The medium-term cost of the unlegislated component of the enterprise tax plan, which is currently before the Senate, is $35.6 billion over the period from 2016-17 to 2027-28, and in 2027-28 the projected cost of that unlegislated component is around $9.8 billion.</span>

I commend him on the work he has done to ensure the M1 upgrade on the Gold Coast, along with his colleagues up on the Gold Coast, the trade minister here. And I congratulate the member for Fadden up here on his advocacy on that. Also, we're ensuring that those working in the Australian film industry, the gaffers and everyone else who is out there who has a job in the Australian film industry, will be supported by the increased support that is being provided by the Turnbull government to ensure there is a solid pipeline of work right across the Australian film industry. We'll see those big films coming to Australia, which, as the trade minister knows, also support tourism in this country very, very significantly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A stronger economy guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on. The key essential services that were provided for in this budget are to ensure that we preserve and increase the choices, the dignity and the respect that Australians can have as they grow older. In this package, which we announced last night, there are an additional 14,000 places for in-home care in this country. They are high-level-needs care places. That's on top of the 6,000 we announced in December. That's 20,000 additional places, just this year, to address the significant choice that more and more Australians want to make, to be able to age in their own home, with their families. The member for Chisholm was reminding me today that for many families, particularly those from an ethnic background, it matters so much to them that they can be in their home with them as they are celebrating Christmas or Easter, or Greek Easter for that matter. It's so important that Australians have that choice, and this will mean that there will be an increase of over 80 per cent on the 2017-18 numbers over the forward estimates in the proportion of those high-level care places. This is something where older Australians should have that choice protected, and we've that done it in this budget. There will be 74,000 high-level home care places available, and that is an increase of 86 per cent on 2017-18. There is $83 million for increased support for mental health services and residential aged care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are backing the choices of Australians like Lucky Steve, who I was talking about today at the Press Club, who is out there wanting to work and knows he needs to work. He is taking responsibility for his life, as he always has. He doesn't growl. He doesn't whinge. He just gets on with it. He provides for himself and his family. For him, we have ensured that we have an extension of the pension work bonus, an extension of the Pension Loans Scheme, the wage subsidy for older Australians, and particularly for self-employed older Australians, who now get that benefit of the pension work bonus of up to $7,800 a year. We're supporting older Australians, their choices, so they can age with dignity and with respect. </span>

There is no stronger advocate or person in this place who has a better understanding of what it takes for small businesses to succeed than the member for Swan. He will be pleased, as small businesses all around the country will be, that the instant asset write-off has been extended for a further year—that successful program begun many years ago under this government to ensure that small businesses can invest in their businesses and grow their businesses. This is an important part of a tax approach that this government has taken, which says that the money that is paid to the government in tax is paid by taxpayers. That's who pays the taxes. </span>

                  </a>  Thank you. The point we're making, which those opposite should listen carefully to, is that when you provide company or indeed personal income tax relief, all you're doing is allowing people who earn that money to keep it. It's not the government's money; it belongs to those who earned it, and that's what we on this side of the House believe. Those on that side of the House think they own everything in your pocket, that they have an entitlement to collect it all and that, what they're good enough to let you keep, you should be thankful for! That's not what the Liberal and National parties believe. That's what the Labor Party believe. That's why they refuse to be constrained on their taxes. We know that the shadow Treasurer—when he became the shadow Treasurer many years ago back in 2013—went proudly to the National Press Club and said that the key test for the government is that they don't allow taxes to rise above 23.7 per cent. He's backflipped on that like he's backflipped on everything he believes in when it comes to someone with an interest in economic policy. If there's a wind blowing outside, the shadow Treasurer better not go outside, because he'll be changing his mind in a heartbeat, because he can never keep to any position! You have to keep guard rails on your tax and on your spending at 23.9 per cent. When you go above that, that's too much tax. We believe too much tax is too much tax, that it suffocates the economy. The Labor Party are going to put a tax burden of over $200 billion on the Australian economy. That is like a snake eating itself from the tail! That's the image they should put on the front of their tax plan, because that's what they will do to the Australian economy if they ever get the chance! </span>

We have a plan on this side, and the Treasurer has been speaking about it up hill and down dale, as has the Prime Minister. He delivered at this dispatch box last night the latest addition and update to a plan for a stronger economy where we create more jobs and businesses create more jobs, and that allows us to support more essential services for hardworking Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was looking back at the plan of those opposite. In the last financial year that the Rudd-Gillard government ran this economy, there was a net decrease of 61,000 businesses in this country, irrespective of size. Under the Turnbull coalition government's plan, updated, as I said, last night by the Treasurer, in the last financial year there have been—keeping in mind that the decrease of 61,000 for Labor was across businesses irrespective of size—65,000 new businesses started just in the small and family business space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it's important that we legislate tax relief for small and family businesses—some 3.3 million of them. Why? Because they employ 6.8 million hardworking Australians. This is where you get the thousand jobs a day from this plan. This is how you enable and empower businesses and people that are prepared to take on bank debt, back themselves and employ people—something those opposite would know nothing about. They are prepared to put their family's home on the line, get out there and employ hardworking Australians.</span>

                  </a>  The risk to the plan is a change in government. Why? We heard this while we were away: we know about some of the harsh things that may happen on a change of government, but what we don't know is about the secret deal that the Leader of the Opposition has with unions and his union mates. Most notably, at least half the frontbench, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, are concerned because they don't know what's in it. They should be concerned. They should be concerned, and why? Would you trust the Leader of the Opposition to go into a room and argue for a wage increase on your behalf, Mr Speaker? That's the question we'll be asking between now and the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition's secret plan with his union mates, most notably the CFMEU, will put a wrecking ball through this economy, putting at risk everything that has been gained by the business community, irrespective of size, over not just the past 12 months but the past five years. Our plan is about improving opportunities for all Australians, reducing pressure on households and providing more certainty when it comes to providing the essential services they have come to expect.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  I thank the member for Petrie for his question. I note how hard he works on behalf of all of his constituents. What a great advocate he is. The government does recognise how important it is to ensure that Australians' retirement savings are protected from undue fees and charges. Why? Because 9.5 per cent of people's wages today are deferred into the future for their retirement income and the government has a responsibility to protect this money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the budget that we announced last night, the government will be introducing a sweeping package of reforms to help safeguard the superannuation of millions of Australians. We are capping the fees on low-balance accounts below $6,000. That will return around $570 million to people's retirement accounts. We are banning exit fees on all accounts. That will return $52 million to retirement accounts. We are improving the insurance arrangements to allow young members and those with inactive or low-balance accounts to choose whether or not they want cover. That is up to $3 billion returned to people's retirement accounts. For the first time we are giving the Australian Taxation Office the powers to proactively reunite people with their superannuation—their lost or inactive superannuation. This will mean that, in the first year alone, $6 billion will go back into the retirement accounts of millions of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will take effect on 1 July 2019 and will mean that people will have more money in their retirement accounts. This is particularly important for young Australians. It will help them to build up their nest egg at the most important stage, as they are building their careers. It will mean for a median-income-earning 26-year-old with multiple accounts that they could save $5,300 in fees and premiums over the first 10 years, which will increase their balance at retirement by around $50,000. This is real money in people's accounts. It is because on this side of the chamber we recognise that superannuation money is members' money. It belongs to them; it should be reunited with them. Those on this side, just like they do with taxes, think that the money belongs to them or to vested interests within the superannuation movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has an opportunity on Thursday night to back these reforms, because it was the Leader of the Opposition, when he was minister for financial services, who mucked this up. He let there be a free-for-all on fees. He put young people into superannuation and we are fixing his mess. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

And, as I've indicated, the full cost over the 10 years is $140 billion. He asks about year-on-year costs beyond the forward estimates. I find that passing strange, to use a term of a former Prime Minister from that side of the House, because Labor's retiree tax provides no year-by-year estimates beyond the forward estimates. They provide a 10-year estimate, which is not 100 per cent clear, I have to say, because it's not clear that they've actually factored in the fact that we've got a $1.6 billion transfer balance cap, which means those with higher balances will be able to use more credits. But I find it interesting that, as usual, he is prepared to apply one rule to himself and a different rule to others. What I know about the Labor retiree tax is it's a kick in the guts to retirees. And what I said last night is this side of the House will not go pilfering the tax refunds of pensioners and self-funded retirees—because we think they should be respected. And the Labor Party thinks they should be taxed.</span>

The Turnbull government is determined to make sure that everyone pays the right amount of tax so that we can continue to ensure that we guarantee the essential services that Australians—millions of Australians—rely on. On this side of the chamber we believe in the integrity of the taxation system. On that side of the chamber they simply believe in higher taxes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have improved the integrity of the tax system by creating some of the strongest multinational anti-avoidance laws in the world. We have also introduced the diverted profits tax and the multinational anti-avoidance tax, and that has seen an additional $7 billion of sales returned each year to the Australian tax base. We have established the Tax Avoidance Taskforce which has resulted in the Australian Taxation Office raising $5 billion in liabilities from large corporations and multinationals across the last 18 months or so, and we are building on this success in this budget by introducing further measures to ensure that businesses are paying the right amount of tax. In particular, we are shining a light on those people who might be ripping off their fellow Australians through the black economy, and I'd like to congratulate Michael Andrew, who led the Black Economy Taskforce review, for the important work that he has done. We are cracking down on the illicit tobacco market and preventing the flow of funds to organised crime syndicates by establishing the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce. We are introducing a $10,000 cash payment limit to crack down on money laundering by criminal syndicates and gangs, and we are protecting honest Australians from being ripped off by those who are trying to cheat on their tax, or get a discount by letting someone else cheat on their tax. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Turnbull government has taken this strong action and introduced tough new laws, Labor, I am sad to say, did virtually nothing to combat tax avoidance when in government. They voted against our multinational anti-avoidance laws, and they were against our country-by-country reporting regime. If that wasn't bad enough, Labor now wants to hit aspirational Australians with a tsunami of more than $220 billion of higher or new taxes—higher taxes on companies and on investments, higher taxes on savings and on superannuation, higher taxes on family businesses, and let us not forget the $56 billion retiree cash grab, which, despite all of their laughable guarantees, hurts pensioners and low-income earners. The choice could not be clearer: we're for integrity of the tax system; they're for higher tax.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:49</span>):  The shadow Treasurer can try and be as tricky and shifty as the Leader of the Opposition with his smarmy approach to stacked-tax policy, but the answer is simple: the cost of the measure is $140 billion over the next 10 years, which is more than twice the relief that has been provided to companies under our enterprise tax plan. We are putting priority on ensuring that tax relief is provided to those on low and middle incomes, and that cost, as I said, is $13.4 billion over the forward estimates—$140 billion over the next 10 years. If the opposition wants to deny Australians lower taxes, then they should just be honest about it. They shouldn't come in here looking for excuses. They will look for any excuse not to reduce taxes for Australians. The bill's on the table. Vote for it or oppose it. Whichever way you do it, the Australian people know where you sit on tax. Where they sit on tax is: higher taxes under Labor; lower taxes under the Liberal and National Party. You're making that very clear to the Australian people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr McCORMACK:</span>
                  </a>  On 23 April, I stood with the member for Wide Bay and the assistant minister, the member for Hinkler, at a very emotional press conference where we announced funding for section D of the Bruce Highway. I was standing behind the member for Wide Bay as he was speaking to the press, and he became quite emotional. He was a policeman, and a very fine policeman, with the Queensland state police force for 16 years. On many occasions he'd had to go and do the 3 am death knock—not something any police officer wants to do—to tell families that their relatives or loved ones were not coming home. Sometimes, those family members had lost their lives on that particular section of road. That 26-kilometre stretch of road from Cooroy to Curra is now going to be duplicated as part of the Bruce Highway upgrade, an $800 million commitment for a four-lane ring-road around Gympie. There will be greater safety and reduced travel times, and people will get home sooner and more safely. That's what the infrastructure spend is all about. With the infrastructure spend for the Bruce Highway in last night's budget, the commitment is now up to $10 billion. This will boost productivity and create local jobs whilst, at the same time, increasing road safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also commend the editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gympie Times</span>, Shelly Strahan, for her advocacy. She very well put it on the front page of her newspaper, under the bold headline 'We did it'. 'We did it,' she said, 'in conjunction with the member for Wide Bay.' This followed on from another very graphic front page entitled 'Stop the carnage'. The article began:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how much this means not only to the member for Wide Bay but, more importantly, to the people he represents, and that's what politics is all about. It's not just about the government or this parliament; it's about the people we serve. The sooner some members remember that the better off we'll all be.</span>

The Treasurer has just provided the 10-year cost of the personal income tax scheme. Can the government now provide the total cost of corporate tax cuts over the same 10-year period, both legislated and proposed to be legislated by this government? If the government cannot provide the 10-year cost, why not?</span>

                  </a>  It's pretty simple. There's a measure before the Senate. It's based on a previous year's budget. It's 10 years, and you have a 10-year cost for the unlegislated measure in the Senate. The 10-year cost for that is clear. The 10-year cost that they've asked about in relation to the personal income tax plan was in the budget, and there's a 10-year cost for that. Heaven forbid you ever get into government and have to manage the nation's finances.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:57</span>):  I want to thank the member for Mackellar, who's been a great advocate for the biomedical sector and the pharmaceutical sector, which have a very significant base within his electorate. One of the things that he has often pointed out is that you can only deliver life-saving medicines, growth in hospital funding, growth in Medicare funding and growth in mental health funding if you have a strong economy, if you have the basis for a stable economy which will deliver better results for those in work and better results so that the government can ensure proper investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that, what we have seen is that this government has been able to secure Medicare and hospital funding, mental health funding and funding for the PBS, as we discussed yesterday, with the investment in Spinraza, in comparison with those who came before us, who denied access to fundamental medicines. Last night, we didn't just invest in life-saving medicines; we invested in a new medical industry in Australia. As part of a $6 billion medical research funding package over the coming four years, there was at the heart a $1.3 billion medical and health sector industry growth plan. That included $240 million for new frontier science research and $248 million for rare cancers and rare diseases clinical trials. This will give access to new medicines to those who could never otherwise have had that possibility. But, at the heart of this new hub, this new funding plan, is a $500 million, 10-year national genomics plan. That's about delivering precision medicine to 200,000 Australians and more. It's about giving them access to genetic testing. It's about building the research capability and making Australia a global destination for the new wave of medical treatment and medical research and all of the jobs that come with it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The two things that we want to create, better health outcomes for over 200,000 Australians and, on the best estimates we have, over 200 new companies and tens of thousands of jobs, come together in this one initiative. The first step we will take as part of this was outlined by the Treasurer today. It will be the creation of Mackenzie's Mission, a $20 million plan to help 10,000 families access preconception genetic testing and screening for conditions such as cystic fibrosis, SMA and fragile X. It means that fewer children are likely to be born with these conditions in the future. That is the outcome of a budget built on a strong economy.</span>

Is it that the government doesn't know what these numbers are or that it's simply refusing to provide the answer?</span>

Penny Wong on the ABC in 2012 said, 'We don't release ten-year costings.' The Treasurer, Wayne Swan, stood at the same National Press Club and talked about 10-year projections being unreliable. He told Radio National's Fran Kelly on 20 March 2012, 'We don't do those 10-year estimates.' Mr Speaker, it's always one rule for the Labor Party and one rule for everybody else. One rule for their union mates; one rule for everybody else. You can't change the rules to suit Shifty Shorten.</span>

We know that it's an uncertain world. We've seen attacks at airports in Europe and elsewhere around the world, and we know that air travellers do face a risk whether it's in this country or elsewhere around the world. In fact, in July last year there was an A380 Etihad flight leaving Sydney bound for the Middle East that persons attempted to smuggle an explosive device onto. Now, had that been successful, it would have been catastrophic. It would have been the biggest aviation disaster since 9/11. It would have had all sorts of consequences for the economy and for the tourism industry—not to speak, obviously, of the human cost.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a look at security settings at our domestic airports as a result. We've been working very closely with the owners of the airports, with the airlines and with other stakeholders, and I'm pleased to say that last night the Treasurer announced in the budget that we have committed $294 million to enhance our security at domestic airports—at regional airports as well as the major airports. We will work with those regional providers and provide capital support to help put in place new X-ray technology. We will have additional efforts in relation to the Australian Federal Police counterterrorist first-response presence at airports. We will work with all of the intelligence agencies to make sure that we can do whatever is within our power to keep Australians safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a continent where people travel freely each day and expect to travel in safety. But we also know that the authorities in this country have now thwarted 14 attempts at mass casualty events and we know that there are people within our own country who would seek to do harm to Australians tomorrow, whether it's at an airport, a place of mass gathering, a school, a food court in a shopping centre—wherever it might be. This threat is not diminishing. The government remains absolutely committed. We demonstrated this again last night, through the measures that we've taken to provide budget savings so that we can manage the budget effectively to pay for essential services, to guarantee these essential services, so that we can provide every effort to the police, to law enforcement and to intelligence agencies to keep Australians safe.</span>

It's $13.4 billion over the forward estimates. The measure is laid out very, very clearly. If you don't want to support it, don't support it. But I say to the shadow Treasurer: go out of this place, look all of those 10 million Australians in the eye and say, 'no tax relief for you', because that's what the shadow Treasurer is doing here. We have been very clear today. We have provided more level of detail on the cost of this measure than those opposite ever provided in opposition. The former Treasurer the member for Lilley is giggling and smiling up there because he knows what I'm saying is true. He never provided it. But we have provided it. The cost is $140 billion. When we came forward with the enterprise tax plan, we said what the 10-year cost was there too. We said today, very plainly, what the cost of the unlegislated measure is in the Senate over 10 years, which is $35.6 billion, and it's peak cost in the 10th year is $9.8 billion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government has no plan to reverse the enterprise tax plan. That is not part of the government's policy. As a result, the government doesn't go around costing policies that it's not going to do. The only people who have a plan to reverse all of the enterprise tax plan are the Labor Party. If that's your policy, you cost it and then you go and tell the Australian people you are going to jack up their taxes—that's what you plan to do, because you have to because you've already spent the money. You spent it all at the last election. Labor spent all the money on the increased negative gearing, on the capital gains tax, on the higher personal tax rate for the top marginal rate, on everything reversing the enterprise tax plan, including $25 billion already for tax relief for small and medium sized businesses, which they can't wait to rip away from those small and medium sized businesses. The Labor Party has a plan on tax to suffocate the Australian economy. The Liberal Party and the National Party have a plan to give the economy the relief it needs to grow into a stronger economy, to guarantee the essential services that Australia rely on, to create more jobs and to have the government live within its means.</span>

In last night's budget, the Treasurer announced a record $5 billion spend of additional money for aged care and senior Australians—a total of 20,000 new high-level care places since last year's budget and 13,500 new residential care places, along with 775 restorative care places for those who have need of them. In addition to that, we've listened to people on the ground who've talked about the need for face-to-face interactions, so we will be putting into place aged-care navigators, who will assist people in hubs across the regions where it is absolutely important. We're looking at simpler forms. We're looking at upgrading My Aged Care, which has created challenges in the past. We're streamlining the assessment for aged-care services so that Australians have a timely assessment that gives them the opportunity to make decisions and choices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, we've focused on the mental-health need in aged care. People, particularly men, over the age of 85 have the highest suicide rates. That is extremely concerning. We are putting $82.5 million into mental health in residential aged care—$20 million will be provided to mental health nurses to help older Australians who live alone and who need the level of support and intervention to ensure that they are given an opportunity to make the right choices around the life that they take. Suicide in older Australians is not something that any of us should ignore. There'll be: $32.8 million for palliative care in residential care, which is an important initiative to ensure that quality of life is provided to those living in those facilities; $22.9 million for physical activity tailored to over-65s, in partnership with community sporting groups, to keep them active, agile and looking after their muscular and skeletal frame to reduce the level of falls; $5.3 million for dementia innovation—not research, but innovation—that allows technology and other support mechanisms to be put into place; and, finally, health checks at 45 and 65 years of age, which will allow people to look at their health status and consider what their options are as they continue into that ageing continuum towards 100 and, equally, what economic and financial planning they need to make in terms of both their ageing and their time within residential care. This government is looking after senior Australians, and I acknowledge the work that we've done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  As the Leader of the House quite rightly points out, to resign from the House, a member needs to write to me. Once I've received it and annotated it, that resignation is effective. Certainly, by the time I entered question time, I hadn't received letters of resignation. Given the Leader of the House has asked me that question, I will, for the benefit of members—without interjections from either side—outline the process. If the House is sitting, once I've received a letter of resignation and annotated it, it's my duty to come into the House and advise the House. If the House is not sitting—and this has been the case on a number of occasions—my practice has been to publicise the fact that I've received it as soon as I possibly can. That's the case and that's my responsibility.</span>

They are almost wholly the responsibility of the Special Minister of State. But the point I'd make is: members can indicate they are going to resign, and, until they have, they remain members of parliament. That's the case. I certainly don't have the power to dismiss members from the House, and I don't think the House would like me to have that power. The Leader of the House with a further question.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until any member does that, they remain a member of parliament. That's not a matter for <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>. That is in the Australian Constitution. If I've got anything to say on the other matters, of course, I'd report that back to the House. But certainly, in terms of electorate offices and the like, those are matters for the government, so the Leader of the House may wish to take that up with the Special Minister of State.</span>

                  <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  The Australian people know a desperate con job when they see it, and certainly they saw one last night, and certainly they saw more desperation at question time today—a desperate attempt to distract from the failings of this awful government. I've got a tip for the government. I've got a tip for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer: if you want people to forget that you're making them work until they're 70 before they can get the aged pension, drop the policy. If you want people to forget that you're going to take $14 a fortnight off pensioners and recipients of Newstart, drop the policy. But, of course, both of those policies are at the centrepiece of their budget delivered last night. They remain government policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you what else remains government policy: they've got to find the money from somewhere to pay for their corporate tax cuts. That's why those measures and other measures remain in the budget, and I dare say we may hear more about this from the honourable member for Jagajaga. If you want people to forget that you're giving billions of dollars away to big business in Australia, maybe the way to do it is not to hide how much it's costing. That's what they're attempting to do: hide from pensioners and people across Australia how much they're giving away in corporate tax cuts. We know they know. Of course they know. The Treasurer is pretty incompetent, but I grant him this: he knows how much his corporate tax cuts cost, but he just won't tell the Australian people. Remember when they first introduced the corporate tax cuts and we asked them how much it costs over 10 years? It took a few goes. Eventually we found out it was $50 billion. Then, a year later, we had to ask again, and it was a bit easier. We found out it was $65 billion. We asked today, and it's back to being very hard to find out, because it's an embarrassing figure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of their plan to try to get the Australian people to forget all their policies which impact on workers, on pensioners and on recipients of government payments is to offer them a tax cut. They say, 'Look at this: we've got a tax cut for the Australian people.' When will the big tax cut take effect? In 2024. This is a Treasurer who last year stood at the dispatch box at the budget and, in all seriousness, very earnestly argued that Australians had to pay more tax. He told us that we had to pay more tax to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. He told us that it was absolutely essential for every Australian who earns more than $21,000 to pay more income tax. Anybody who dared oppose the tax was told that they were being unreasonable, obstructionist, cynical and opportunistic. We were even told we were being un-Australian, just 12 months ago. Of course, this year the Treasurer pops up and says: 'You know all that stuff I said last year about a personal income tax rise? Scrub it. It's not necessary. We don't need it any more. Oops—got that wrong.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the guy who tells us he knows what's going to happen in seven years time. He has a plan to give us a tax cut in seven years time, when he hasn't kept one policy from one budget to the other. Mr Deputy Speaker, I dare say that you don't know what you'll be doing in seven years time. I don't know exactly what I'll be doing in seven years time. I hope to be standing there! I've got a daughter who has just started high school. She'll hopefully be at uni in seven years time. I've got a son in primary school. He might be doing the HSC in seven years time. What we don't know is exactly what the budget or the economy will be doing in seven years time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that long-term planning and consistency from this government in economic policy isn't their strong point. The guys who want to bring in a tax cut in 2024 are the same guys who brought you state income taxes. That lasted not seven years but two days as government policy. They brought us the GST to pay for personal income tax cuts. That was a long-lived policy by this government's standards. That lasted six months. Now we're told they've got a plan which lasts for seven years, all on the basis of the Prime Minister being re-elected twice over that seven-year period. I'm not sure the member for Wentworth will be the leader of the Liberal Party in seven weeks, let alone seven years. But he's told us to trust him: they've got a seven-year plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what does that seven-year plan cost? What do the different elements of that seven-year plan cost? Is anybody in the House any the wiser after an hour of question time as to what the seven-year plan costs? Talk about budget responsibility! How dare this parliament ask what the cost is of a plan that we were told, even as early as this morning, we should vote upon immediately? We should vote upon it; no questions asked. They've got a deal for us, they've got a deal for the Australian people, down at Malcolm and Scott's car yard: a tax cut in seven years. But don't ask for any details. Don't ask any tricky questions that involve numbers or dollar signs, because they don't want to tell us. Again, I give the Treasurer this much credit: he knows the answer. He just doesn't want to tell us, because the answer is not particularly convenient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are also tax cuts on 1 July this year. Somebody earning under $37,000 a year will receive $4 a week. Somebody earning between $48,000 and $90,000 a year will receive $10 a week. With wages growth at record lows, penalty rates being cut and somebody working on the weekend losing $77 a week and with private health insurance premiums going up and electricity costs going up, of course these tax cuts are warranted and of course they will be supported by this parliament. They'll be supported on that side of the House and on this side of the House. But I say this, Mr Deputy Speaker, through you: how about you put it to a vote? We want to see those tax cuts implemented and we put to you: why don't you let us vote on those tax cuts? We want to see those tax cuts delivered to the Australian people on 1 July. It would be an act of outrageous cynicism if you held those tax cuts hostage to your hoax of a tax cut in 2024. If you said, 'We won't give you a tax cut in 2018 because we can't get our plans for a tax cut in 2024 through the parliament, because the opposition, that terrible pesky opposition, dares to ask questions about the tax cuts.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note they are doing it through a rebate—the low- and middle-income earners tax rebate. I note in passing that, in the budget, that rebate is non-refundable. A non-refundable rebate is being introduced into the tax system. You can get your tax bill down to zero, but you can't get tax refunds after that. It is a principle which is consistent through the tax act, with one exception: dividend imputation. It's good enough for low-income earners and good enough for middle-income earners to have a non-refundable rebate, but for those people on a high incomes, who don't pay income tax, they must get a refundable tax concession. They must get cheques, even if they haven't paid income tax. That says it all about the priorities of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bravado of the government, which says that they will provide tax cuts in 2024 as their big economic answer, is that they talk of implementing those tax cuts when they won't tell the Australian people the cost and while proceeding with the plan to make Australians work until they're 70. I gave the Treasurer a bit of credit before, saying he would know the answer in relation to the cost of the tax cuts. But that's where my generosity ends, I have to say, because an important part of this debate is the government's plan to make Australians work until they're 70—</span>

                  </a>  The Treasurer didn't say it was rubbish last night when he was asked about the plan to make Australians work until they're 70—which has been in the budget papers since 2014 and is still in the budget. The Treasurer was asked last night about the plan to make Australians work until they're 70, and he said—wait for it—'But that doesn't happen for 35 years. That plan doesn't get implemented for the next 35 years.' But it starts in 2025. That's not 35 years away. The Treasurer doesn't know the impact of his own policies. He thinks they're not going to make this policy work for 35 years when, in fact, it is working in 2025 and will be fully implemented a few years after that. The pension age is going up on your watch, and not in 35 years time. It starts going up in 2025. That is not 35 years away. I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker: there are a lot of inconsistencies, a lot that is illogical, and a lot of unfairness in this budget. That's been the hallmark of all the budgets since 2014; since that famous Joe Hockey budget in 2014—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  This MPI from the shadow Treasurer refers to the failures of this budget. If he wants to talk about failures, he doesn't need to look any further than the member for Lilley behind him, ably assisted by the member for Rankin. Indeed, he only has to look at his own short and lamentable period as Treasurer to talk about failures. We all recall the well-coined phrase, 'Bowen's black hole'—$16 billion which just disappeared. If the shadow Treasurer wants to talk about failures, he just has to look behind him. Look at his mentor, the member for Lilley, and the six deficits we had when we were promised four surpluses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on from this pretty shabby MPI, let's look at the budget last night. As someone who worked with the Treasurer on this, I was very pleased to see the reaction to our personal income tax plan. The shadow Treasurer scoffs and laughs at people who will save $10 a week, the 4.4 million Australians who will save about $10 a week—or perhaps at the other 5.5 million Australians who will save some tax starting from 1 July; he might scoff at them—but that is real money in people's pockets. That is real money that's going to help them with their budgets today. But to deal with the longer-term issues and our over-reliance on personal income tax, step two and step three of our personal income tax plan are crucially important. The shadow Treasurer has been squirming all question time, trying to find a way of getting out of supporting these personal income tax cuts. Just fess up: you don't want to support personal income tax cuts. You don't want to support the way we are dealing with bracket creep in step two of the tax plan. You don't want to stop millions of Australians from moving into a higher tax bracket of 37 per cent. After the personal income tax plan is legislated, we know that 94 per cent of Australians will never move above the 32.5 per cent tax bracket—32.5 per cent. For millions of Australians, they won't have to worry about taking on those extra hours, or getting that happy and unexpected promotion that leads to a pay rise pushing them into a higher tax bracket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that separates our two parties—and the Treasurer spoke a bit about it in question time—is the view of the shadow Treasurer and the Labor Party that, somehow, money that you earn as an individual belongs to the government first and what they generously bestow upon you is something you should be very grateful for, as opposed to the view of the coalition: we believe it's your money and we've got to have a very good reason for taking it off you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take it to the next election. The shadow Treasurer spoke about the next election. At the next election we will be speaking about personal income tax cuts for middle-income Australians. He is trying to find a reason to squirm out of it. You don't need a reason, shadow Treasurer. You don't need an excuse to squirm out of it. Just be proud and say you don't want to support personal income tax reductions. Just be proud. Don't try and find those faux excuses to squirm your way out of it because you are too ashamed to talk about it. Just be proud that you believe in higher taxes because you've lost the argument, sadly, with your leader. You have lost the argument with the left wing of your party who have basically said, 'No, we want higher taxes and higher spending.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we did in the budget wasn't just about backing individuals and backing those who want to aspire for more and to work hard; we are also backing businesses. The shadow Treasurer's questions in question time are very interesting, because his questions in question time indicated that they are planning on reversing our small business tax cuts. Apparently, if you are a small cafe with half a dozen employees, a retail shop with half a dozen employees or a small manufacturer with only a couple of employees, you're somehow going to be treated as an Apple or a Google—a big, bad corporate, as the Labor Party would refer to them. Shadow Treasurer, you can go to the next election promising to wind back those tax cuts for small businesses, because we know small family enterprises reinvest everything that they save in their businesses. They grow their businesses and invest in their staff. Often they treat their staff more like family members than employees. The shadow Treasurer should be very loud and proud that he is going to go to the election saying: 'No, we don't want personal income tax cuts for middle income earners. We want to reverse the tax cuts that have already been legislated in relation to small businesses.' Don't try and find these shabby excuses to vote against them or to reverse these tax cuts; just be proud about what you're doing. The Australian people will punish you for it, no doubt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of this year's budget is our early return to budget balance. The significance of this is the contrast to the Labor Party. It's the contrast to the four years of surpluses that the former Treasurer announced. I think we know who might have written that line: it was the member for Rankin. The member for Rankin must have written that line, because we know he was the key man. The member for Rankin was the member for Lilley's key man in his office. He must have had a hand in that line: 'The four years of surpluses that I announce tonight'. If that happened anywhere else, you'd get turfed out of the party, but the Labor Party put them on the front bench. To go around saying you were Wayne Swan's key advisor in those outstanding glory years of the Swan treasurership gets you a seat on the front bench. That's a pretty good deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A different approach was outlined last night: underpromising and overdelivering. That's very important. The Labor Party overpromised. We all remember the $16 billion that was going to be raised by the resource super profit tax. Was that another idea from the member for Rankin? The resource super profit tax then morphed into the MRRT, which didn't raise anywhere near the $16 billion that it was supposed to raise and was going to be spent. This is the credibility of the party that we're dealing with here. A different approach was outlined last night—a different approach where we return to surplus a year early, where we have sober predictions of growth and where we have a sober approach to all projections in the budget. That's enabled us, for the last six budget MYEFO updates to meet or exceed our targets or to meet or exceed our projections. That's how you do it, shadow Treasurer. Last night, I know it was very, very difficult for you because the scene has been set for a very high tax approach, an anti-small-business approach, an anti-medium-income-earner approach—</span>

                  </a>  A very grim view.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SUKKAR:</span>
                  </a>  It is a very grim view of our country. But another aspect of last night's budget was infrastructure. I must say as a Melburnian that $5 billion for the airport rail link—long overdue, I think most Melburnians would say—is a key investment from this government, with $3 billion recommitted for the East West Link, which the Labor Party so shamelessly spent $1.3 billion cancelling, and $1.75 billion for the North East Link. I am being parochial, but there are investments in infrastructure throughout the country: $24½ billion of infrastructure projects the length and breadth of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing is a Treasurer and a government that are literally watching every dollar and every cent and reinvesting those into good things. A big portion of it's being reinvested into allowing people to keep more of their own money—low- and middle-income earners will take the lion's share of tax expenditures—and getting back to surplus earlier than expected, again underpromising and overdelivering, which is the hallmark of Treasurer Morrison; making key investments into infrastructure; and so many other important things. A strong economy isn't an end to itself; it enables us to do the things that the Australian people expect. That's what this government's doing, and that's what this budget does in spades. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  That was the most extraordinary performance, but absolutely nothing will beat the way in which we saw the Treasurer in question time today completely refuse to tell us the total 10-year cost of the company tax cut. Now, why would that be? Why would every single Australian want to know the total cost of the company tax cut? Of course, they don't want to be photographed in here giving a massive number that might be $80 billion, might be $90 billion, might be $100 billion—we don't know how much it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I can tell you: the pensioners of Australia want to know. They want to know the number because not only do they know that this budget contains an $80 billion tax cut for the biggest companies in this country; they know that this budget contains the abolition of the energy supplement, which each and every one of these people, National Party members and Liberal Party members, have voted for. They've actually already voted for it twice. You've all voted for it twice—to say that a pensioner couple would be $550 a year worse off. That's what's inside this budget, and that, of course, is helping fund this massive cut to company tax—a cut to pensioners so that a pensioner couple will lose $550 a year. That's what these people are doing. That's what's inside this budget. And that's why this budget can only be described as a cruel hoax to older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the shadow Treasurer also highlighted the one big zombie from 2014-15 that still lives—it's still alive; it's still in this year's budget—and that is that the age pension age is going to go up to 70. This lot over here are ashamed of it—a bit like they're ashamed of telling us the total value of their company tax cuts. They're so ashamed of it that, since the last election, they haven't brought this legislation back into the parliament. They actually know they won't get it through the parliament. They might get it through here because all these lemmings will vote for it, but it won't get through the parliament because Australians know it is unfair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This lot don't have the courage to bring it in here, but they keep it in the budget, so the level of the surplus they hope to get to is actually a fairytale. You count a huge change—the increase to the age pension age—that actually isn't going to get through the parliament, that you haven't even had the courage to bring in here. How on earth is it fair? And I'd say particularly to those of you who represent farmers: I know there are members of the National Party who don't agree with this policy, and they should have the courage to actually stand up and say so. They know that there are farmers who cannot possibly work until they're 70. There are tradespeople who can't work until they're 70. There are nurses who can't work until they're 70. That is why this is an unfair policy. This lot are only keeping it in the budget because they need it to help pay for an outrageously unfair cut to company tax. That is why they're keeping it in the budget. They've got an $80 billion cut to company tax, and Australians are going to have to work longer to help pay for this huge largesse to the top end of town. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have worked all of you out, particularly older Australians. They do not agree with working until you're 70. They know it's unfair. They do not agree with a cut to the energy supplement, which is just a straight cut to the pension. That is what is in this budget: a cut to the pension. You are cutting the pension by $14 a fortnight. That is what is in this budget.</span>

I've got that strange feeling we've seen it all before. To top it off, the member for Jagajaga is scaring the heck out of older Australians. She's talking about cutting taxes and removing supplements that were to pay for a carbon tax that no longer exists. She's working in that murky, grey area of half-truths. The irony of her statement about older Australians working until they're 70 is that older Australians now have a job, younger Australians now have a job and middle-aged Australians now have a job because of the policies of the coalition government. We have the lowest rate of unemployment for some time. While the members of the Labor Party are trying to create anxiety and chaos and while there is gnashing of teeth and slashing of wrists in this place, out in the wider realms of Australia, there's a degree of calmness because they know that they have a government that is in control. They know that we've just seen a budget that will provide a platform for Australians, as individuals, as small businesses and as companies, to do the best that they can. The Labor Party like to find someone who can achieve, so they can shut them down or tax them. This budget is enabling people to take charge of their own lives and get on with things.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget we've touched on things that are important to the people of Australia, and I'll go through some of the budget measures for my part of the world. We've recognised the tax relief, and 57,185 of the taxpayers in the electorate of Parkes will get some relief from paying tax in the 2018-19 financial year. We're going to see more high-level aged-care packages because of the importance of giving our most valued citizens, our older Australians, the care, the nurture and the support they need to stay in their own homes. We are encouraging young people in rural areas to participate in tertiary education by reducing the guidelines around parental income so that more people can access youth allowance because they will not be put out because of their parents' income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're looking after rural health with $550 million through the Stronger Rural Health Strategy, which will mean the Murray Darling Medical School. In the city of Dubbo, Sydney university will have a facility where you can do end-to-end degrees in medicine and go on to do specialisation in medicine. Coupled with the $25 million that was in the last budget for the cancer centre, we will see doctors being trained as oncologists in Dubbo in the near future with the facilities that are there. These are important things in the day-to-day lives of people in rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Roads of Strategic Importance will provide $3.5 billion so that we can tackle some of the pinch points. Sometimes the first mile is the most difficult mile in getting produce to market, tourists to a destination or kids to school. With Roads of Strategic Importance, several councils will be able to work together, come up with a project and combine to do something that will grow the economy and be of benefit. The return of the Stronger Communities Program will provide small grants for sporting organisations and community groups so they can put some money into their facilities. A couple of thousand dollars can mean that the community doesn't have to spend days selling sausage sandwiches to make money.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Building Better Regions Fund. We're just about to see, from a previous round, the Bourke small animal abattoir. There will be over 200 jobs in the country town of Bourke, with many of those in the Indigenous community, to process feral goats for the international market, partly funded by the federal government. That program can continue. This government is focusing on what matters to the people of Australia. We're not getting caught up in the campaign— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  As we learned again in question time today, the Treasurer is not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, but I think that even this Treasurer would have regretted beginning his speech last night about the budget by asking the Australian people: 'What have we achieved; what are we going to do next; and what's in it for the Australian people?' I'm happy to inform the Treasurer. What has he achieved so far? He's doubled the debt in this country from $175 billion to $350 billion on his watch. What is happening next? They're going to give at least $80 billion to big multinational corporations and $17 billion to the big banks. And what's in it for the Australian people? Cuts to their hospitals, cuts to their schools, cuts to their pensioner energy supplement and cuts to their TAFE. The list goes on and on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You'd have to be pretty spectacularly out of touch to expect a big pat on the back for a budget which cuts the pensioner energy supplement at the same time as it gives a $17 billion tax cut to the big four banks. You'd have to be spectacularly and stupendously out of touch to expect a round of applause for a budget which takes money from a pensioner in the suburbs and gives it to one of the big banks in the dock at the royal commission right now, where we're seeing all the rorts and rip-offs being uncovered. It says it all about those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget last night had two main political objectives for those opposite on the eve of an election. The first one was to try to make the Australian people forget all of the pain that has been inflicted on them over the last five years and over the last four budgets—all the damage that has been done to our social fabric and to our hospitals and schools over the last four budgets. Last night was all about trying to make people forget about all of that. We saw an unedifying spectacle from the Treasurer, who wants to claim all of the credit for the fact that the global economy is in the best condition it's been in for a decade. He wants to claim credit for the economies of the world improving so substantially that they have delivered to him $40 billion in extra taxes and charges in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite that $40 billion in extra money—free money that the Treasurer got courtesy of the upswing in the global economy—we've still got the old cuts of $17 billion from schools, $700 million from hospitals, and the pensioner energy supplement. Remarkably, despite $40 billion just showing up, rolling through the door and landing at the Treasurer's feet, we've now got new cuts: $270 million pulled out of TAFE, and we know how much damage that will do; and $127 million pulled out of the ABC, the public broadcaster, to satisfy some kind of petty, vindictive political vendetta on that side of the House. The list of cuts goes on and on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this $40 billion which has shown up at the Treasurer's feet in this budget, we still have record debt in this country. Net debt is twice what they inherited from us. Gross debt has only ever crashed through half a trillion dollars under one government ever in the history of Australia: this government. It is at half a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years. It will be higher in 10 years than it is today, and they want a round of applause for this rubbish that they delivered last night, despite all this new revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The surplus for 2019-20 is $2.2 billion, and that includes $3½ billion for an accounting trick which brings tobacco tax forward a year into 2019-20. Without changing tobacco tax, there wouldn't be a surplus in 2019-20. It's also based on the zombie measures that the member for Jagajaga mentioned, which won't pass the parliament. It's based on some very optimistic assumptions about wages. The list goes on and on and on. The whole budget is built on an assumption that the global upswing is permanent, which is a very dangerous assumption. We've seen Liberal governments give permanent tax cuts on the back of temporary spikes in revenue. We know how that movie ends, and it doesn't end well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all of this, they want us to sign up now to a set of income tax cuts when they won't tell us how much those income tax cuts cost. They want the centrepiece of this budget to be an enterprise tax plan where they won't even mention how much it costs over 10 years—the enterprise tax plan which dare not speak its name. They want us to sign up to all this despite record debt on their watch. We support tax cuts for 1 July, and everyone understands that beyond that we'll be fairer across the board. We'll be more responsible as well. We'll provide relief to those we represent and those who need it most.</span>

                  <a href="241590" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to address this MPI on the 2018 budget, because it's a budget which shows how this government is delivering on our plan for a stronger economy to create jobs and guarantee essential services that we all rely on. There's already been a very positive response to the Treasurer's speech last night. Our local paper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Central Coast Express Advocate</span>, has the headline 'Oldies, low-mid income earners winners in federal budget' for our region. This is true, but it's only part of the story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary and for the benefit of those members opposite, here's how our plan is building a stronger economy. First, we're delivering lower, fairer and simpler taxes. Second, we're backing businesses to invest and create more jobs, especially small and medium businesses. Third, the budget is guaranteeing the essential services that we all rely on, like schools, hospitals and Medicare, and supporting older Australians. Fourth, we're keeping Australians safe, including safeguarding our borders. And, fifth, we're ensuring that the government lives within its means, with a forecast return to a modest budget surplus in 2019-20 and a projected surplus of $11 billion in 2020-21. This is something that members opposite did not achieve during their time in government. These are signs of a strong budget—a surplus, something that members opposite did not achieve during their time in government. These are signs of a strong budget, which I've already been talking about with my community across the Central Coast. Importantly, almost 60,000 taxpayers in the Robertson electorate will receive a new offset of up to $530 a year to help reduce cost pressures on household budgets.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mrs WICKS:</span>
                  </a>  What this means, for example, for a shop assistant on $45,000 working at a local store is that they will have an extra $440 in their pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,380 in their pocket over the first seven years of the tax plan as the tax relief increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local residents across the coast are already starting to respond to the budget news. Selwyn from North Gosford said to me, 'It took a while, but it was worth the result.' Trish from Umina Beach and Fred from Woy Woy both wrote to thank the government for our support for older Australians.</span>

                  </a>  They did, and many others besides. As well as guaranteed record funding for Medicare and hospitals, the government will boost financial security for older people on the Central Coast and across Australia, helping those who want to be able to work longer and giving them more choice in their care. We'll also protect people from Labor's unfair retirement tax. Elizabeth at Gosford welcomed the tax changes and said it gave flexibility to individuals and families. But it was Patricia who said it pretty well. She said: 'I appreciate a government which is focused on a good healthy growing economy by not putting us in more debt and working towards reducing our debt.' Patricia said, quite rightly: 'People seem to forget when we have a Labor government—they enjoy all the things offered but with no thought to the consequences of overspending. One can't run a successful household or business budget by spending more than one has and not planning for the future.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we've heard from businesses and their representatives, such as Rod Dever, President of the Gosford/Erina and Coastal Chamber of Commerce. Rod said today that the chamber is supportive of the budget and many of the financial opportunities it presents for the taxpayers and businesses alike in our region. One of the opportunities presented is the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which is continuing for another year to help small business invest in new equipment. Well over 1,000 local businesses in my electorate of Robertson have already benefited from this popular measure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also builds on our significant previous infrastructure investment on the Central Coast, which includes $10 million to help deliver Gosford's long-awaited world-class Regional Performing Arts and Conference Centre. The council has recently confirmed that the former Broadwater Hotel on Mann Street is the preferred site. This is great news. Together with funding from the New South Wales government and council and the support of our arts community, it will be a fantastic cultural venue, of which we can all be proud. We're also delivering $7 million towards a new regional library and learning and development centre in Gosford, and a landmark Central Coast Medical School and Health and Medical Research Institute—an $85 million project with the New South Wales government and the University of Newcastle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Somersby industrial estate, Banjo's Skate Park and the Terrigal Trojans clubhouse were all confirmed in the budget, along with roads funding for the Central Coast Council through the Roads to Recovery program and our election commitments, including the upgrade of Oceano Street at Copacabana. We are on track with our commitment to continuous mobile coverage on trains and a New South Wales business case to investigate faster rail for commuters, and I will have more to say about this exciting project soon. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  It appeared from question time today that the government wants to hide so many figures from its budget. It didn't seem very proud of it today. Clearly, when it comes to aged care, it shouldn't be proud, because there's not one new cent for aged care in this budget. Despite what the government said in the speech last night and despite what the government continued to say in question time today, there is not one new extra dollar for aged care in Australia from yesterday to today. We have the government come in here and talk about $80 billion in tax cuts for big business. Even though they won't tell us what the number is, they want us to vote for it. But they're happy to come in here and pretend that they're giving new money to aged care, particularly to home care packages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I and my colleagues on this side have been calling for the government to do something about the wait for aged care home care packages for over a year. We could see the waitlist growing and growing and growing and, quite frankly, an additional 14,000 packages over four years does not cut it when there are 105,000 older Australians sitting on that waiting list today. They are not going to get these packages any earlier because of this budget, and the government should stop pretending that they will. They should stop pretending that this is going to provide the packages any earlier. The wait time for these packages at the moment is over 12 months. I've got examples of people contacting me who have been waiting longer than that. This budget is not going to help that waiting list. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In six months last year that list grew by 20,000. There were 20,000 people added to the waitlist. After pressure from us, the government said: 'We'd better do something about it. We'll put on 6,000 new packages.' The waitlist is still 105,000. What does the government think is going to happen in the next four years when it adds only 14,000 new packages? How long does the government want this waitlist to grow? When it claims it has got $40 billion in new revenue and when it can afford to give $80 billion in tax cuts to big business, you would think it could do something about the home care waiting lists that it talks about and pretends that it's going to help older Australians with. It's not okay to play this cruel hoax on older Australians and pretend that they're going to get home care packages sooner and pretend that you've spent more money in aged care when you have not. It is absolutely not okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They seem to want to hide a few figures, as I said earlier. In the Senate in question time today we asked some questions about these home care packages. In particular, we asked the government about the waitlist. We had Senator Bridget McKenzie deny that 105,000 people are waiting on the waitlist, despite Treasurer Morrison saying on radio today that there are indeed 105,000 people on the waitlist. Never mind, I'm sure they'll work it out. That interview today was really interesting because Sabra Lane, on <span style="font-style:italic;">AM</span>, actually took the Treasurer to task about the waitlist, and quite rightly, because it is a hoax. She asked him about the waitlist and how this is actually going to help. He had to admit that there's more work to be done. Of course there's more work to be done, Treasurer. There seems to be plenty of money for big business but no new money for aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm just astounded that they continue to come into this House and the other place and pretend that there's new money for aged care, and pretend to older Australians, their families and their carers that somehow the aged-care package they're waiting for is going to turn up sooner, because it's not. It's not. It is just unbelievable. Today, when we asked a question about how many residential aged-care places they are going to cut to fund this, they wouldn't answer it. They wouldn't answer it. They don't want people to know how many residential aged-care places they are going to cut to juggle the deckchairs on the ship. People are not going to get services any sooner, because 14,000 over four years is not going to be enough. Now they want to cut residential aged-care places to pay for it. That's what they are doing in this budget. Older Australians will not be conned by this government's cruel hoax of a budget. I will continue to lobby every day for the older Australians on that waitlist.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the magnificent 2018 coalition budget. What a great budget it is. Doesn't it just continue the great work of creating jobs and growth that we have achieved so far—a million jobs. I listen to the other side say how lucky we are. Isn't it a coincidence that the better the decisions we make, the luckier we get? Labor wouldn't understand about good economic decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I came to this place and made my first speech, I said that one of the greatest responsibilities that this generation of members of parliament will have will be caring for our older Australians. That is what this budget does. It absolutely cares for our older Australians. We are looking after that group of baby boomers who are starting to hit the aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the last budget, on top of the 14,000 home care packages that were announced last night, we also had 6,000 home care packages announced in the MYEFO. I really want to recognise the amazing work that Minister Ken Wyatt is doing in this place. He has come to Wide Bay on a number of occasions. He has sat down with the aged-care providers, and it's from his coalface experience and inquiries that he's managed to bring together this fantastic news for aged care. The $82 million extra for mental health for older Australians in care is incredibly important. As the minister stated previously, we have the highest rate of suicide in men over 85 and we are doing something to prevent this. We should be proud of these measures. We should also be proud of the 13,000 extra residential places that we have created in the budget. All of this comes from good economic management, which is what we do in the coalition. The centrepiece of the budget for Wide Bay—and Wide Bay has an amazingly good story to tell about this budget—is an $800 million upgrade to the Bruce Highway, which continues on from the fantastic work that my predecessor, Warren Truss, did in delivering section C of the Bruce Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had many years of experience with this road. Unfortunately, they haven't been pleasant ones. As a former traffic accident investigator, I was the person who received those phone calls in the late hours of the evening and had to go out and deal with what were awful tragedies. When I came to this place, one of my strongest desires was to see this section of road—and the detailed design and acquisition of the corridor had almost been completed—fast-tracked to be constructed. Because of the wonderful economic management by the Turnbull-McCormack government, we're seeing that brought forward some five years. That means lives will be saved. People who would have been terribly and tragically killed on that road will be walking around and living because we managed the economy well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other fantastic news about this budget is that, as always, the coalition is looking after the workers. We are the party of the workers.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN:</span>
                  </a>  This is never more evident than in us ensuring that we provide tax relief for those hardworking Australians. Whilst the pretend working class on the other side there interjects—and I'm sure they've all done a hard day's work in their life. All of them over there have been hatched out of the union incubator. The party of the workers—what a laugh that is! It's the coalition looking after the workers. It's our $530 tax offset for workers. We like workers. And let's not forget bringing the budget back into surplus. When was the last time the Labor Party did that? It will be 30 years ago next year, which will be the year we actually bring the budget back into surplus. So I'm very proud to be a part of a coalition government— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia deserves better than this grab bag of a budget. A good budget, a better budget, would invest in Australia's productivity, ensuring we had a good National Broadband Network, increasing infrastructure investments as a share of national income—not falling, as we've had under this government—and making productivity investments, such as properly-funded schools and universities. Today the vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, Brian Schmidt, wrote a letter to the university in which he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the long-term, capped places will mean fewer of our citizens will be able to become the skilled graduates that our nation needs to retain and increase its productivity. As my fellow Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman said, "Productivity isn't everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything … "</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to talk about how essential education is and how important it is to invest in skills for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good budget would also tackle the challenge of inequality. It is now at a 75-year high after a generation in which the top one per cent's share has doubled and the top 0.1 per cent's share has tripled, after a generation in which we have seen wages grow three times as fast for the top 10 per cent as for the bottom 10 per cent. But we have seen wages growth stagnating in Australia. From when the ABS began collecting comparable wages data in December 1998 through to September 2013, when the Abbott-Turnbull government took office, wage growth was running at 3.6 per cent a year on average. Since September 2013, wage growth has run at 2.2 per cent on average—that is, a full 1.4 per cent slower. So when a worker on $53,000 a year is looking at their $530 tax cut, they will be saying to themselves: 'This might make up for one per cent slower wages, but I've had 1.4 per cent slower wages ever since the Liberal-National government got into office.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good budget would tackle the challenges of risk: the household debt to income ratio at an all-time high, the geopolitical risks that we know our nation faces. Yet we don't have anything in this budget that de-risks the economy, that builds up the social insurance that Australians need. We have in this budget a company tax cut costing $80 billion. Independent economist Saul Eslake talks about the evidence that the government has given to support the impact of company tax rates on wages, and he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They've certainly not been able to point to any contemporary or recent examples where cuts in company tax have produced the results suggested by economic theory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's not at all clear that Australia needs to lower its company tax rate in order to attract more foreign investment—or indeed that if we do lower our company tax rate, we necessarily will attract more foreign investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about street spruikers is they are never as good as promised. A 0.1 per cent surplus in 2019-20 could be blown over by a light breeze. As Saul Eslake says, the idea that wages growth will be running at 3½ per cent per annum stretches credulity. The fact is, this is yet another Liberal budget, brought down not by Santa Claus but by the Grinch. And, as always from the coalition: they cut, you pay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise and talk about last night's federal budget. Last night's federal budget was a fantastic budget for people right around Australia. Last night, for those hardworking people in Petrie and right around Australia, we saw tax cuts and lower taxes delivered. We are very proud of that. For those people that are working hard, those couples that are trying to get ahead to pay off their mortgage, to raise their kids, we saw reward for effort—where we will hand back their money. We're looking after the environment. We're guaranteeing essential services. We are able to do all this because of a strong plan that the Liberal-National Party took to the last election, and that was a plan for jobs and growth in the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party would have you think these things happen by accident. If you listen to the member for Rankin: 'It's a global upturn; it's all an accident. That's why you have another $40 billion in income this year.' The member for Rankin misses the point that the coalition had a dedicated plan around free trade agreements, around business tax reductions, around defence manufacturing, around innovation and bringing manufacturing back. All of these things we took to the election, and we have seen 400,000 jobs created in the last 12 months—75 per cent are full-time—and one million jobs since 2013. These things don't happen by accident, Mr Deputy Speaker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night's budget was a great budget, because we are rewarding those Australians. We want to see them keep their own money. In Petrie, 66,223 people will receive a tax cut starting in two months time—that is, in the 2018-19 financial year, 66,223 people in Petrie will receive a tax cut. That's a high school teacher earning $75,000 a year who will have an extra $530 in their pocket. A shop assistant in Petrie, someone on a minimum wage of $45,000, will have an extra $440 in their pocket. Yet the shadow Treasurer of this country, the member for McMahon, kicks off this MPI today, and it takes him seven minutes and 30 seconds to acknowledge that tax cuts start in two months. This same shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, and the member for Jagajaga don't even know the difference between the retirement age and the pension age, yet they're the ones that voted to put the pension age up to 67. They really are clueless when it comes to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the fact that the costs of essential services like education and health go up every year and are increasing this year, the member for Rankin says that they're actually going down. No, they're not, Member for Rankin. Australians remember that 690 days ago, at the last election, the Labor Party said that the government would sell Medicare, yet bulk-billing rates and health investment are up right around the country. We saw massive investments last night in mental health services, which is fantastic. It's really good news. None of this stuff happens by accident. I say to people in my electorate: we're able to do that because of the plan we took for jobs and growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at tax cuts. We know that we want to reduce tax. In the next seven years, starting next year, we want everyone in this country who earns under $200,000—we believe that it's fair for the government to take one-third of your earnings in tax. We want to limit it to one-third. Ninety-four per cent of Australians will pay one-third, 32½ per cent, of what they earn in tax up to $200,000. We think that's fair, and we budgeted for that last night. Why are we reducing business tax for small and family businesses and company tax? They would have you believe that we just give this away. Do you think we like to give tax away for the fun of it? Do you think we come up with a policy in relation to business taxes just to go, 'Let's just give it away.' They use this figure of $80 billion. Why do we give it away? Because we know, and we have evidence from the last 12 months, that jobs are being created. It's all about the people of our electorates. It's all about Australians, and last night's budget delivered in spades.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—This report outlines findings of the committee's inquiry into the security of overseas missions as managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This, I might note, is the first JCPAA inquiry in a number of years to focus on DFAT. It is not a regular focus of our attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">DFAT's purpose includes promoting and protecting Australia's interests internationally and contributing to global stability and economic growth. To support this work, DFAT maintains a presence overseas of 106 diplomatic posts or missions and is responsible for the security arrangements at these posts—that also includes responsibility for the security of more than 3,000 DFAT locally engaged staff and staff from 20 other agencies—and those are measures to protect staff, property and confidential information critical to national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In DFAT's own words, 'Elsewhere poor risk management could be financial loss, but here the results could be catastrophic.' In that very real sense, this is life-and-death stuff. Yet the committee found—and this is a government-controlled committee—that, despite this, a recurring theme of this inquiry was the lack of consistency and coordination in DFAT's management of overseas security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter has a long history. The Audit Office previously reviewed DFAT's protection of missions and staff overseas in 2004-05. In this follow-on audit tabled in August last year, more than a decade later, the Auditor-General identified a number of issues which still remain unresolved. The ANAO concluded that DFAT had arrangements in place to provide security to overseas missions and staff, but it added that some aspects, in particular the strategic planning management of security measures and elements of the framework supporting staff training, were not entirely effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANAO's findings, in addition to the further evidence provided to the committee during the inquiry, raised a number of concerns for the committee. The committee noted that poor coordination and lack of consistency have had an impact on the delivery of core security functions. A number of issues identified were also characterised by inadequate monitoring and assurance. The committee considered that the ANAO's findings and the persistence of weaknesses relating to overseas security measures undermined the department's credibility before parliamentary committees. It wasn't their finest day out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard that DFAT's departmental security framework, which was to be launched in March 2018, is intended to address various issues highlighted by the ANAO and previous reviews. The department also noted actions it's taking to reduce inconsistencies in record keeping and risk management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee supports the Auditor-General's position that organisations must impose consequences for noncompliance in order to drive cultural change, and the leadership of the organisation has to provide the clear direction for that change. Compliance can be monitored then via independent assurance activities such as internal audit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also turned its attention to and appreciates the critical importance of cyber-resilience to protecting organisational systems and information and acknowledges DFAT's stated commitment to achieving cyber-resilience by June 2018 with respect to the Essential Eight mitigation strategies. We've asked for a report back in July to check that that's done, because, as I said, this is not just about property and the lives of Australian personnel but also about critical confidential information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a range of other findings that you'll be pleased to know I chopped out of my statement and won't go to in detail, but they relate to the need for DFAT to improve the quality of its performance indicators and discrepancies we identified in a previous annual report. As the chair of the committee stated, the annual report's a critical document. It is signed by the secretary, and the parliament has to have full confidence in what's signed off and presented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it's the committee's view that governance arrangements can only be effective with the necessary staff skills and capability underpinning them. The committee noted that limitations to DFAT's information systems actually prevent the consistent monitoring and assurance over whether staff even receive the required mandatory preposting security training. DFAT advised that work was underway to address that, but we were not fully confident from the repetitive, process-based answers which we received. Of particular interest to the committee was staff awareness and training in cybersecurity. DFAT indicated that it's considering mandating cybersecurity training for locally engaged staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, in summary, the committee made eight recommendations. That's a large number for us. Several were aimed at improving DFAT's governance of post security, while others address aspects of staff training. We've sought further advice from DFAT and recommended that DFAT reports back to us on a range of issues. Thank you for the House's attention to a lengthy statement, but these are not trivial matters. They go to the security and the lives of more than 3,000 staff working around the world and their families. In conclusion, I would like to thank officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the ANAO for assisting the committee in its inquiry. I commend the report to the House, and I seek leave to table some documents.</span>

I would like to stress the importance of the integrity that underpins the way that we, as a nation, fund our agricultural research and say that this is not the time to tamper with it. This particular legislation does that. It changes the way our corporate R&amp;Ds are able to spend funding. While it does have the support of the relevant R&amp;Ds, it expands the definition of marketing activities, and I think that's a negative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I really want to call on the government to pay some attention to research and development and to say to the minister at the table and my colleagues on the other side, particularly the National Party, how extraordinarily disappointing it is to read the budget papers and to look for agricultural research and development and find there's nothing there. There's no plan for the future. Sure, there's some money for marketing to employ some people in overseas countries to open up our markets, but this whole idea of how we grow the productivity of Australian agriculture has just been left for dead. It shouldn't be that way. In my electorate of Indi, we've got a huge amount of agricultural production. We've got a very strong agricultural stakeholders' group that lobbies me constantly. Today, I want to talk about agriculture in my electorate. But, before I go there, I want to talk about the history of research and development and my involvement in it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, before I was a member of parliament, I worked as a consultant in agricultural research and development. My job was to extend the knowledge of R&amp;D out to the community and pay particular attention to women, who are mostly the business managers on farms, and to young people. As a result of 20 years work in R&amp;D and extending that knowledge that came out of our research, I was approached in 2011 to be part of a rural research and development council. The point of the council was to come up with a national strategic investment plan for research and development. Colleagues, I really would like to draw this to the attention of the House, because it was excellent work. It was supported by everybody. But, as happens, the idea of a national investment plan in R&amp;D and a coordinated approach to research and development in Australian agriculture got left by the wayside, and, sadly, still hasn't been picked up. We see the lack of that investment and that planning, I think constantly, in many of the problems we are facing in agricultural research. That was a really important document. I bring it to the attention of the House and make a recommendation that the minister and his staff pay some attention to the recommendations in that report. That was in 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, we had the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, with an investment of $4 million but no national plan. It was, in my opinion, an ad hoc, 'Let's do this, let's do that, lots of programs' approach. It was a piecemeal approach to how the nation should develop its agricultural resources. In 2016, I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry. We did an inquiry into agricultural innovation. It was a fantastic group of people to work with. We had cooperation right across the House. We did extensive work. We met with people involved in research, development and innovation right across the nation. We presented a report to the then agriculture minister, and it just sat there. It sat there and sat there. None of the recommendations of that House of Representatives committee have been looked to in any way, shape or form. So we don't have a plan for agricultural research, we don't have a strategy for it, and I think the nation is less because of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I bring to the attention of the House that other nations, including many of our trading partners, have taken this step. For example, in 2015 the European Union developed a report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Towards a long-term strategy for European agricultural research and innovation by 2020 and beyond</span>. It's so obvious that it seems mind-boggling to me that we in Australia haven't actually taken that step. There are models we can follow. The call has been put out, but there's just been a failure of this House to take up that call. For me, it's not only a policy paper that we need; we need the opportunity. My call-out to our new minister is to begin work on this in a productive way so that, by the time we get to 2020, we actually do have a strategic plan for agriculture—research, development, innovation and extension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I saw this legislation come before the House today and the changes in it, I thought that, while they're small, they actually talk about marketing. One of the things that has really frustrated me with agricultural research and development and the way that we spend our money is the organisational power of our marketers to grab the bucket of money for R&amp;D and say: 'Yes, but we've got to market. We've got to sell what we do. We've got to get overseas and market our produce.' For sure, marketing is important, and I would never say that it doesn't need some investment. But, for me, the real gold of agricultural research and development is the research. It's taking our ability in Australia to produce fantastic food, grow fibre and do things with agriculture, innovate and value-add so that we create the jobs in the regions and in the cities that are going to be the future of this nation. I think we're letting ourselves down. I think we're letting industry down. I definitely think we're letting our farmers down. It's a really sad thing for me when I go to the farmers in my electorate, from the small-scale farmers to the large-scale farmers through to the exporters, and say, 'But we don't have a national plan.' Rarely do I come to this House and hear my colleagues talk on legislation that's relevant to R&amp;D. It's just a thing that doesn't seem to grab the interest of the House. That's such a pity because, for many of us who live in the regions, agriculture does still underpin our livelihoods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, my way of tackling this lack of interest in Canberra in the need for regional R&amp;D and local R&amp;D is by running what we call North East Victoria agricultural dinners. These dinners bring together leaders in education, marketing and logistics, stock and station agents, researchers, academics, farmers and allied agricultural professionals. We've had three of these dinners and they've been a terrific success. They provide an opportunity for people to share ideas, to think about vertical integration and the role of North East Victoria. Over 50 per cent of the water that falls in the Murray-Darling Basin falls in my electorate, but it's very underdeveloped. We've got so much potential. So we get together and talk about what we might do. We share knowledge and expertise. We look at the documents that the Victorian government has done on regional development and opportunities for regional growth and discuss how we can, as communities, value-add to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many opportunities and it's reflected right across Australia. In my electorate alone, Tourism North East provides 27 per cent of the regional employment and is based largely on agriculture—on our food, our wine and the experience of coming to North-East Victoria. Something like $692 million is put into the economy. I could give you the figures on agricultural production, but it's about what we do with it, how we innovate and how we bring people to the country to enjoy the wonderful experiences we have to offer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, we've been told we need more collaboration, we need a lot more confidence, we need a hugely more skilled workforce and we need infrastructure. There are very specific recommendations that I constantly bring to this House. How are we going to collaborate in agriculture on research and development? How can we get the confidence of the university sector, the agricultural sector and the industry sector to take the risks that innovation needs? Having a skilled workforce is one of the huge issues that we face. How do we get the people we need with the knowledge we need in the area? Part of the significant failing has been the lack of a strategic approach to higher education in rural and regional Australia. It's an issue I take up with the Minister for Education and Training, in the Senate. I ask, 'Where's your strategic approach to growing the workforce that we need in the country?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was so disappointed in the way that much was made in the budget last night about how we're going to train doctors—that we have a network of university hubs to train doctors. That's well and good, and doctors are certainly useful when people are sick, but where's our strategic approach to training agricultural scientists? We don't have one. We've got such a shortage. A couple of years ago in Australia—the figures have changed a little bit since then—there were something like 600 agricultural scientist graduates a year and we had jobs for 5,000 of them. There's no workforce plan for this and there's no strategic approach for it. No-one even talks about it, and yet agriculture is just so important for the whole economy. I'm putting the call out to the minister to pay some attention to this. To members of the opposition: as we get ready for the next election, give some thought to what your agricultural research and development policy would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to talk about two agricultural producers in my electorate who have done such amazing work. They're leading examples of agricultural research, innovation and creativity. They do such good work in employing local people, innovating with produce and then marketing it so well. I'd particularly like to note Gooramadda Olives. Gooramadda is near Rutherglen on the Murray River. Huge congratulations to Rob and Melanie Whyte for the wonderful work they do. They've just been awarded an international prize at the New York International Olive Oil Competition. They should be so proud, not only for getting the international award—beating the Italians and everybody else in the world—but for being a family based business and competing on the international scene. They're locally based near Rutherglen, they're a tourist destination and they're the most fantastic contributors to our community. We know we can do so much more. I give a shout-out to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example I'd like to briefly mention to the House tonight is a different sort of business: the Australian Pumpkin Seed Company, which is near Myrtleford in the Ovens Valley. I give a shout-out to Sharan West-Rivett and her husband for the fantastic work they do in growing pumpkins for pumpkin seed. Out of the pumpkin seed, they make pumpkin oil and then they do magnificent work, not only with oil but with cooking. They value-add to all the other products, like hazelnuts. There are all sorts of other oils that you can now buy in the shop. They tell me that they have people growing pumpkins at Goondiwindi and right across Victoria. There's a huge opportunity to expand. If they grow, we won't have to import pumpkin seeds from overseas. It's just a small business, but it does such good work in employing people, acting as a tourist destination in the Ovens Valley and value-adding to our produce. It was a delight to go there and see the oil press actually operating, with the oil coming out of the pumpkin seeds. The paste left over is used in so many different ways. Nothing is wasted. This is a shout-out to Australian Pumpkin Seed Company on the terrific work, innovation, research and development they do and what leaders they are in agriculture. How proud I am to be your representative in parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In bringing my comments to a close, what I really would like to say to Jay and Sharan, who do the work at Pumpkin Seed, to all the farmers in Indi and to all the people who work in agriculture: I'm certainly your advocate here. I take my role seriously to work with my colleagues on the other side, to work with the Labor Party, to work with the Greens and to have parliament understand that agriculture is the foundation for so much of our nation's wealth. But if we take our eye off the ball—if we let R&amp;D go, if we don't have strategic long-term investment in innovation, workforce planning and value-adding, or if we get sucked down the road of marketing only—we will get to a dead end. If we haven't got the innovation or the creativity about our products, no amount of marketing is going to work for us on the world scale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I say to my colleagues, to the advisers in the boxes tonight, to the minister—he is here—and to all of my colleagues around Australia who I know care so much about R&amp;D: join me with this push. Can we encourage this minister to have a conference to call together R&amp;D and actually look at a long-term strategic approach to how R&amp;D in agriculture research can enable us to take our place as a leading industry in this nation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I rise in support of the Primary Industries Research and Development Amendment Bill 2017. Our primary industries are one of the great strengths that we have as a nation, and they are also a key component of our economy—particularly our regional economies and the communities that they sustain. In the electorate of Calare we are blessed with talented people, bountiful natural resources and the can-do attitude to make the most of our opportunities. Our Australian farmers are, without doubt, the best in the world.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr GEE:</span>
                    </a>  I note the interjection and the endorsement and agreement of the member for Indi. I would also say, with respect to her previous comments: if you'd like to see agricultural research and development in action, come to Orange in the Calare electorate. More on that shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years now, our Australian farmers have been amongst the world's most efficient growers of quality produce. They work hard, regularly investing and innovating to succeed, without the trade barriers and subsidies that exist in other countries. Our farmers are succeeding because they embrace the idea of doing things better, not just by working harder but by working smarter. Our agricultural sector is also, without a doubt, the world's best. But this doesn't just happen; a huge amount of work goes into making Australian agriculture such a success story. It starts on the farm but it includes a host of other organisations. Amongst these are our Commonwealth statutory research and development corporations, charged, in this case, with the development of cotton, grains, fisheries and other rural industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's success increasingly depends on the discovery and distribution of knowledge across our agricultural sector. Thinking more broadly, this means not only do we have to share knowledge amongst growers and producers but we need to inform and persuade potential customers and consumers. While our research and development corporations help farmers to apply science to grow better fruit, grain, fibre or fish, they also need to communicate these advancements and their benefits within respective markets. Yet until now, four research and development corporations have been strictly limited to funding their marketing activities and efforts with industry-wide statutory marketing levies or fees levied on every single producer. These processes have, to date, involved consulting, reaching agreement and establishing and collecting levies. As my colleague the member for Cowper has previously noted, they have been very costly, time consuming and contrary to the ideal of speed to market. By freeing our research and development corporations to raise marketing funds through voluntary industry contributions, grants, gifts and even bequests, we'll enable our peak bodies to convert their research breakthroughs into higher agricultural sales and market share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Central western New South Wales, including the Calare electorate, is at the vanguard of agricultural innovation in Australia, thus my invitation a short time ago to the member for Indi to come and visit. The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, based in Orange, does terrific work, and I'd like to bring to the attention of this House some pertinent examples of how industry collaboration and communication can quickly turn into commercial opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A New South Wales Department of Primary Industries team, including Dr Fay Haynes, Lloyd Kingham and Adam Coleman, recently worked with Local Land Services, New South Wales DPI offices of biosecurity and New South Wales DPI Agriculture to build long-term market resilience into our orchards and the orcharding industry. As part of this, the team introduced the use of irradiation-based treatment to completely assure the quality of our fruit to overseas customers. After this was introduced and proved with respect to our cherry trade with Indonesia, Vietnam accepted this use of irradiation within its own export protocols, and we've restored our market access there. I congratulate all of the parties who worked to achieve that goal and that important milestone in our agricultural exports. The upshot is that, when we demonstrate and communicate product innovation, industry costs can be lowered, markets can be opened and stabilised, and agricultural exports can be grown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge the work of our farmers on the ground collaborating with the New South Wales DPI, including local New South Wales Farmers members who've worked with the DPI on this and many other programs. I make particular mention of the chair of the Orange branch of the New South Wales Farmers, Bruce Reynolds, Graham and Annette Brown, Guy and Sim Gaeta, Peter West and Joe Caltabiano. There are many others; they are just a few who have collaborated with the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke earlier of the need to market our agricultural breakthroughs to potential buyers of our produce. Just as important is the ability for research and development corporations to speed the uptake and adoption of their knowledge and intellectual property by our farmers. We're doing this in Calare with a specialised facility that enables ag-tech innovators and specialist firms to fast-track agricultural innovations to market. This initiative is called the Global Ag-Tech Ecosystem, or GATE. It's an incubator. It's a collaboration at Orange between the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, Horticulture Innovation Australia, the Cotton Research and Development Corporation, and SparkLabs Cultiv8. The aim of the GATE is to facilitate all forms of Australian agriculture to gain greater access into global markets and, in particular, Asian markets and also to facilitate funding and investment. It's an ag-tech centre. It's based at the Orange Agricultural Institute, close to Orange's agricultural finance companies and institutions, which continue to grow in number and for which the area is becoming renowned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was present at the launch of the GATE. This initiative is unique and impressive. This is agriculture looking to the future. It highlights the energy and enterprise of those at the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries who drove it, but it also demonstrates that there are some very exciting things happening in country Australia. Many people were involved in the development of this initiative, but I'd particularly like to acknowledge the efforts of the director general of Department of Primary Industries, Scott Hansen, and the deputy director general, Michael Bullen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see this bill, which enables research and development corporations to operate more strategically in their marketing activities, as part of a broadening of their capability to respond properly to market circumstances and to capitalise on industry opportunities. As I said, there are some exciting developments. There are some exciting things happening in agricultural R&amp;D and ag-tech innovation, and a lot of it is happening in the Calare electorate. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  The Primary Industries Research and Development Amendment Bill 2017 will allow the statutory rural research and development corporations—the fisheries, cotton, grains and rural industries R&amp;D corporations—to conduct marketing using voluntary contributions. R&amp;D corporations have helped to keep rural industries productive and profitable by conducting research, development and extension which are practical and relevant to each industry sector. New advances in science and technology provide great opportunities for Australian farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through its investments in research and innovation, this government is helping farmers to make the most of these opportunities. Together with rural industries, we invest over $600 million annually in the rural R&amp;D corporations, and about $300 million of this is government funding that matches eligible R&amp;D expenditure. In addition, the coalition government established the Rural R&amp;D for Profit program to improve farm-gate productivity and profitability and deliver real outcomes for all Australian farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural R&amp;D for Profit drives collaboration between different industry sectors and leverages broader commercial and research funding. Total funding available for the program is $180.5 million over eight years ending in 2022. Grant funding of almost $114.7 million has been awarded to 36 projects over the first three rounds of the program, matched by almost $170 million in cash and in-kind contributions from successful applicants and their partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of industries have already seen benefit in having a single body guiding industry R&amp;D and marketing—and most industry-owned corporations were established to also do marketing, I may add. Marketing has helped to build our pork, wool and red-meat industries, to name just a few, and expanded Australian access to international markets. There are 15 rural R&amp;D corporations, of which 10 carry out marketing activities which provide a valuable service to their respective industry sectors. However, the four statutory R&amp;D corporations can only conduct marketing activities if they receive a statutory marketing levy. The industry-owned R&amp;D corporations that have chosen to undertake marketing don't have any such restriction. Establishing a statutory levy is expensive and, of course, can take some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, these amendments mean that the fisheries, cotton and grains industries and smaller rural industries, such as chicken, meat, honey, rice and pasture-seed industries, will be able to promote their products without the expense of establishing and collecting a statutory levy. Promoting their products has the potential to increase the size and value of those industries. Larger and more valuable primary industries are likely to be more self-sustaining and to provide flow-on benefits to the Australian community by creating employment and broader economic activity. The bill will also include 'an activity incidental to marketing' in the definition of 'marketing activities' to allow the R&amp;D corporations to plan and consult about those respective activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proactive industries are the future of Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Industries that see an opportunity to promote their product grow their business and ultimately become more profitable. This bill will help a range of rural industry sectors to make it happen and is, of course, another demonstration of the government's commitment to implementing effective policies to ensure that Australian agriculture is achieving its full potential. I therefore commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. For the edification of the House and also those who may be listening, a working holiday-maker is an individual holding a subclass 417 working holiday visa or a subclass 462 work and holiday visa. To be eligible for these visa subclasses, applicants must be between 18 and 30 years of age and be from eligible partner countries. These visas allow holders to work in Australia while having an extended holiday for up to 12 months. It's really a cultural exchange and it's done for the purpose of amity between countries and to have people from overseas get to know the values and virtues of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Bill 2016 passed parliament in late 2016 as part of a raft of bills better known as the backpacker tax package—and who could ever forget it? As part of the package, there was a requirement that set up a legislative framework allowing the taxation commissioner to establish a mandatory registration process for employers of working holiday-makers. Through this registration, businesses would be listed on the Australian Business Register as an employer of working holiday-makers and withhold tax from those employees at the correct rate of taxation. This meant there would be greater protections for working holiday-makers from exploitation at the hands of unscrupulous employers. However, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 seeks to water down and strip away the provisions to protect working holiday-makers in Australia that passed parliament only at the end of 2016. In an attempt to quietly make good on a backroom deal that the government made with an Independent senator to pass the original legislation, the Turnbull government are with this piece of legislation throwing out everything they once stood for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes at a time when there are significant, recurrent and highly publicised stories of working holiday-makers being exploited in regards to their wages, conditions, safety and entitlements. Regrettably, there have even been stories of vulnerable workers being exploited that have not been published or publicised. I've met with workers across the country in my role as the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, including in my home state of Queensland as well as in Bendigo, the Blue Mountains, Perth and elsewhere. What I've repeatedly heard in these meetings is that the current conservative government, the Turnbull government, isn't doing enough to protect vulnerable and migrant workers. Now, out of desperation to do a deal, this out-of-touch government will water down one of the very few protections backpackers have when it comes to their pay. Once again, only Labor will stand up to protect workers from exploitation, including Australian workers, working holiday-makers and any other overseas workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will oppose this bill. This legislation is yet another example of the Turnbull government's back-pedalling. I'm sure everyone in this place and the other place can remember the painstaking back-and-forth negotiations about the backpacker tax at the end of 2016. We were forced to endure this because of the inability of the Turnbull government to govern and govern effectively. The prolonged process created uncertainty for farms across the country as well as potential working holiday-makers. The Prime Minister and the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for New England, did everything they could to try and collapse over the finish line at the end of the 2016 parliamentary year. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With an odd sense of sense of deja vu or like a bad episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Twilight Zone</span>, we're back again debating issues surrounding the backpacker tax. The reason we're here is that the government cut a deal with an Independent senator, a crossbencher. We know that, in exchange for the Independent senator's support of their preferred tax rate at the end of 2016, the Turnbull government agreed to weaken the original legislation before it had passed in the first place. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> on 13 December 2017, a spokesperson for the Treasurer said in relation to this bill:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been so long since the bill was first introduced on 16 February 2017 that it leaves me wondering why this legislation has been resurrected and why it's now before the House today. Could it be that the Independent senator is worried? Could it be that the government cut the deal in late 2016 and that particular Independent senator has now realised that the government failed to keep their end of the bargain? I really wonder. It is curious timing that this bill comes before the House at the same time as the government needs the support of the same Independent senator to get its $80 billion handout to the top end of town across the line. It is clear that cutting deals and selling out workers is the norm for the Turnbull government. It is very important to be sceptical of the government's motives in relation to this matter—and who knows? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments before the House today will remove an avenue of protection for vulnerable workers and a method of ensuring greater transparency. It removes the requirement for the public listing of employers registered to employ working holiday-makers, which affects a backpacker's ability to log in online and choose an employer who will charge the correct level of tax each week. Without the ability to check this, backpackers could be out of pocket each week and have to wait until tax time to get their money back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an ironic twist, this legislation comes less than two months after the government's Migration and Other Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Integrity) Bill 2017 passed the House. It was a piece of legislation that Labor supported, because it went some way to protect vulnerable workers. They were good measures, but, by comparison, this bill is not a good measure. It sells out workers, it sells out backpackers and it diminishes their rights. Labor will oppose this callous undermining of migrant and backpacker workers—some of the most vulnerable and exploited workers in the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the precise provisions of the bill. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 amends the bill and A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999. There are also subsequent amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953. The amendments to A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 repeal a certain provision. That provision, which is called paragraph 26(3)(jc), details whether or not an entity such as a business is registered under section 16-147 in schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and the date of the said registration. The paragraph will be amended: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to ensure that the Registrar of the Australian Business Register is not able to release publicly or otherwise provide working holiday maker employer information to a person who applies to have the entry in the Australian Business Register about an entity released to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, it's about not releasing the information so that the working holiday-maker can't get that information about the entity which is registered in the Australian Business Register. It means that if someone specifically wants to make an inquiry about a potential employer, to see whether they are registered, the bill prohibits that information being released. The explanatory memorandum itself rails against transparency by explaining that, even when the information about the register is tabled in parliament, this reporting process will not identify any working holiday-maker employers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill specifically goes out of its way to ensure that businesses and individuals who employ backpackers will never publicly be identified. If these businesses and employers are doing the right thing, what do they have to hide? Paragraph 26(3)(jd) details that, if an entity's registration to employ working holiday-makers has been cancelled, this paragraph will be repealed. What this means is that working holiday-makers in Australia will no longer be able to look up whether or not the business employing them is even registered to do so, heightening the risk of exploitation of backpackers. Even if a business has had its registration to employ working holiday-makers cancelled, working holiday-makers will not be able to access this information. The bill strips out vital protections for inherently vulnerable workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to look at the explanatory memorandum for this piece of legislation to find out the Turnbull government's only plan to address possible exploitation of workers: expectation. The explanatory memorandum reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It would be expected—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">expected!—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">that … employers of working holiday makers would advise individual employees who are working holiday makers of their status as a registered working holiday maker employer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's expected that the employer will do the right thing. It simply beggars belief that the Turnbull government is denying working holiday-makers something it had previously promised to them, a public register that allows for visa holders to review who is registered for working holiday-maker programs, but is then expecting—expecting!—the business to do the right thing: to disclose their registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This register would have ensured that about 200,000 prospective working holiday-makers in Australia would be able to be paid appropriately before they even apply for work and have greater protections given the cases and instances of abuse and exploitation we have seen in public. Instead, the Turnbull government have sold out these workers and their protections, as they've done on so many occasions, such as when they failed to do anything about the cut to the penalty rates to some of Australia's lowest paid workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Working holiday-makers are vital to Australia's farmers and producers, our regional towns and our Australian economy. Throughout my electorate in the Somerset region and rural Ipswich, and indeed Ipswich central, tourism is a significant employer of local people, and working holiday-makers help keep local cafes, hotels and tourism operators in business. In the first year of their trip, those on a working holiday visa, subclass 417, can choose to do 88 days of specific work in regional Australia, which is more often than not doing seasonal agricultural work such as fruit picking or working in pubs or hostels, often in regional and remote locations. Fulfilling this 88-day requirement is one of the criteria to be eligible to stay for a visa for a second year. The main purpose of these visas, as I've said earlier in the speech, is a cultural exchange opportunity for young travellers who could work to pay their way throughout Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government needs to be doing more to protect workers, especially vulnerable migrant workers and backpackers in regional areas specifically. I recently heard reports in Rockhampton, Gladstone and Cairns, where I was. These workers expressed to me their concerns about the lack of protection for working holiday-makers. There is the desire of locals for local workers to get the first shot at jobs, but locals in these regional areas are concerned as well about the exploitation they've either witnessed or heard about. Our temporary work visa program must not be used as a backdoor way to source cheap labour. It's essential that the government undertake strict labour market testing and temporary skilled workforce arrangements to ensure employers aren't favouring overseas workers over local Australian workers by undercutting wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note today that we had to drag the government kicking and screaming on labour market testing. In my time in this place, the coalition partners have never supported labour market testing. We fought them across two days in this chamber on labour market testing, and we had to defeat them in the Senate. Fortunately, the government has accepted reality and this morning accepted Labor's amendments. We welcome it. It's probably the first time in the 10 or 11 years I've been in this place that the Liberal and National parties have ever accepted labour market testing. Why? Because the budget requirement meant that they had to get their Skilling Australia Fund through. But we welcome their about-face. We also would welcome it, by the way, if they agreed to our 2016 plan for a fairer temporary work visa system, which we took to the last federal election. That's a measure to ensure that, no matter how a person is employed or which skilled visa a person works under, all workers are treated with fairness, respect and dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to the integrity of the skilled migration program was further strengthened when we announced in May 2017 that in government we would establish an Australian skills authority. That Australian skills authority would be an independent labour-market testing body that would ensure temporary work visas are only available when there's a genuine skills gap and no local workers can do the job. This ensures local workers get the first shot at a local job while ensuring that the temporary skilled migration program doesn't exploit vulnerable workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We implore the government not to weaken the legislation before the chamber today. We are very concerned on this side of the chamber of the potential exploitation or abuse of workers by the passage of this bill. We hear stories about these abuses reported in the media, by unions, by the Fair Work Ombudsman and by concerned industry bodies. The March 2016 report <span style="font-style:italic;">A national disgrace: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he exploitation of temporary work visa holders</span> details these abuses in length. The exploitation of these vulnerable workers shows that changes to the working holiday visa programs must offer better protection against unscrupulous employers seeking to take advantage of cheap and vulnerable labour. These are the people who visit Australia, travel around our country, see our stunning landscapes and experience our culture while working their way around the place. They can enter a small rural town, pick fruit and make some money. But, regrettably, they can fall into the most abhorrent exploitation by unscrupulous individuals and employers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some migrant workers have detailed their working conditions as slave labour, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>. The report <span style="font-style:italic;">Wage theft in Australia</span> found nearly 30 per cent of migrant workers surveyed as part of the National Temporary Migrant Work Survey were paid $12 an hour or less, well below the minimum wage. And news.com.au reported in May 2007 about Matt Workman, a chemist from the UK travelling in Australia with his girlfriend, who was verbally and physically abused by his supervisor. Mr Workman said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His negative experiences weren't limited to his time on the farm. The hostel he and his girlfriend stayed at was a place of anguish for fellow working holiday-makers. He told news.com.au:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have seen people crying, people fear being sacked and kicked out of the hostel with nowhere to go in the middle of nowhere … It is impossible to make a complaint without risking being evicted without notice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UK government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has provided advice online warning tourists heading to Australia on working-holiday visas that occasionally issues can arise. Well, it's far more than occasionally. It's simply not good enough, what the government has done in this space.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any amendments to legislation that undermine Australia's work-holiday visa arrangements aren't amendments that should be considered in this place, and they shouldn't be supported. There have been claims of psychological and sexual exploitation. There wouldn't be a member in this place who hasn't had people come up to them and tell them about egregious exploitation. I know I have as a local federal member. Some of the most terrible exploitation I've heard in country towns, when I've been doing mobile offices. Even in Ipswich I've heard shocking examples of sexual exploitation and intimidation. In July 2017, the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Story </span>shared the story of backpackers who'd been exploited working on Australian farms. A Canadian backpacker, Chelsey, was offered a job on a grape farm in Mildura. She had to fight off a farmer—her employer—as he attempted to sexually assault her. Marcel, a German backpacker who arrived in Australia in late 2006, lost his left thumb in an accident on his first day on the job in a sweet potato farm in Bundaberg. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The machine had been switched off but was switched on again very quickly and my hand was trapped. When I pulled out my hand my left thumb was missing … I had never done this sort of work before and we were given no more than a 15 or 30 second safety induction.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 15- or 30-second safety induction is outrageous. Your heart goes out to these people. Recently I met with the members of the National Union of Workers in Melbourne and Bendigo, hearing their personal stories of exploitation. They had faced shocking exploitation at the hands of unscrupulous employers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these stories definitely do not occur on every farm across Australia—and there are good employers; we know that—we should do everything in our power, in this place, to ensure that unscrupulous employers aren't able to taint the entirety of the agricultural sector. One way we can do this is by making sure these workers know about things. Knowledge is important. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is an anti-exploitation measure. This bill removes that knowledge. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment bill before the House is proof that the Turnbull government can't be trusted on protecting workers, especially working holiday-makers. We believe in a fair day's work. We believe it deserves a fair day's pay with proper conditions to match enjoyed by everyone who works in this country. Labor's plan for a fairer temporary work visa system, which we took to the last election, included measures I urged the government to adopt. We need to ensure that the Working Holiday Maker Program is appropriately regulated and that allegations and instances of abuse and exploitation are properly investigated. We need to properly resource the Fair Work Ombudsman and we need the political will to clamp down on exploitation. The Turnbull government needs to take the abuse of working holiday-makers more seriously and ensure that visa holders aren't having their wages, their workplace safety and conditions or their entitlements exploited.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a register of employers registered for employing working holiday-makers is a step in the right direction in cracking down on the exploitation of workers at the hands of employers who are not doing the right thing. It gives migrant workers the chance to make an informed choice, with knowledge about who they should work for and how their weekly take-home pay will be affected by that choice. Instead, this government has opted to go down the path of cheap political trade-offs and pointscoring. It's a government that's prepared to cut a backroom deal on an $80 billion handout to millionaires, to multinationals. The government did a deal with an Independent senator at the end of 2016, and today we're debating the outcome of that deal. It's a play from the playbook of the Liberal and National Parties, which Labor will always stand up against. Only Labor will stand up against the exploitation of workers, including migrant workers, working holiday-makers or other people who come to this country. We will not support this bill. Knowledge is power.</span>

This is an issue I've been very vocal about as it has made its journey through this place. Backpackers are a vital component of life in regional and remote areas in Australia and they are often the lifeblood of many small country towns who struggle with the unique requirements of businesses in regional Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the final act of this parliament in wrapping up this holiday-maker issue. We have agreed to changes following the crossbench agreement with respect to guaranteeing support for this legislation. This bill seeks to commit that employer registration information about working holiday-maker employers will not be made publicly available, and the Commissioner of Taxation will only be able to disclose this protected information to the Fair Work Ombudsman if an entity is suspected of noncompliance with a taxation law. This sensible proposal aims to encourage those businesses who take on working holiday-makers and to alleviate their fears that the government might have been overreaching its oversight of backpackers. As long as businesses who hire working holiday-makers are doing the right thing, doing what they're supposed to do, there should be nothing to fear in that respect. All employers of working holiday-makers will still be required to register themselves with the Australian Taxation Office. Registered employers will be able to withhold tax at the new working holiday-maker rate of 15 per cent from the first dollar of income up to $37,000. This amendment to the original backpacker tax bill does not affect the requirement of the ATO to report this information annually to the Treasurer for presentation to the parliament. This reporting process involves aggregate employer information and will not identify any working holiday-maker employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The working holiday-maker reform package passed by parliament last year, which I spoke on in this place, included four elements, the first being that, from 1 January 2017, all working holiday-makers were to be taxed at 15 per cent from the first dollar earned up to $37,000 and then, following that, the usual taxation rates would apply. From 1 January 2017, only registered employers are entitled to withhold tax at the 15 per cent tax rate. From July 2017, the rate of tax on the departing-Australia superannuation payment for working holiday-makers would be increased to 65 per cent. From July, the passenger movement charge would be increased by $5 per non-exempt passenger, up to $60 per passenger.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall speaking on this issue some time ago, as we've heard from the Labor Party, when this House passed the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Bill 2016. The amendment we're discussing today strikes a very fine balance between taxing working holiday-makers at the appropriate level for the work they do and continuing to attract them to Australia. As a government, we had to ensure that we did not create the situation that members opposite had proposed whereby working holiday-makers were being taxed less than their Australian counterparts. This, by now, is pretty much par for the course when we're dealing with the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was in charge as the minister, was the world champion or the Olympic champion or the Commonwealth champion when it came to issuing 457 visas and taking those Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we stand up for jobs and we certainly stand up for regional communities. I'd like to acknowledge the many fabulous initiatives in the budget that we heard the Treasurer discuss last night and today. I believe 100 per cent that it's a very good budget for regional Australia. We believe in creating policies that allow regional towns and cities to grow and prosper, and, in truth, many of these towns survive because of the backpackers. I think it goes without saying that we want Australians to take those Australian jobs, but that is not always possible. Backpackers fulfil roles that many locals simply do not want to do. Perhaps this is an area of welfare reform we really need to take seriously—ensuring that Australians who are on welfare take jobs where there are jobs. But that is not the case that we face here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regional communities that I represent have working holiday-makers performing every role imaginable just to keep the wheels of the Western Australian tourism industry running, without a doubt. There are some stunning statistics around what the working holiday-makers are doing when they're working and travelling around regional Australia. They may only stay in towns that they're working in for a short time to fulfil their visa commitments, but they are more likely to donate their time to organisations in those towns, they are more likely to spend their money and contribute to the economy of that town and they are more likely to do the jobs that others in the town won't do. They are indeed a very, very critical asset to keeping regional communities alive. You'd be hard-pressed not to be served by a backpacker if you went to buy a beer, a coffee or a hotel room somewhere in my electorate, so they are critically important to my seat of Durack. These hardworking young people are a resource that regional Australia simply cannot live without, and we need to stand up and advocate for the hard work that they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a result that I and many of my fellow regional Liberals—my good friend here, the assistant minister and member for Hinkler, the members for Barker, Forrest, O'Connor and Canning and many of my other colleagues—fought very hard for to make sure that we improved the lot of the backpackers and ensured that critical resource was maintained. All too often, regional Australia is overlooked and forgotten. I'm very proud that I've been able to work with the members on this side to bring this chapter to an end. The fact that this policy has already been implemented, not eight months after the election last year, is stunning. I think it indicates how important we on this side believed reform in this area to be. We are a government that's committed to responsible management of our regional communities, the backpackers who work in them and the employers who employ them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to address a couple of the key concerns of many business owners, such as that their private business information will become public. The government has heard and acknowledged their concern, and has amended the legislation accordingly—that's what this bill seeks to address. The rationale for the establishment of the register in the first place was to protect young working holiday-makers from exploitation. Young people travelling from abroad and working in Australia for the first time are particularly susceptible to predatory employers. This government has been listening to working holiday-makers' concerns and their horror stories of being trapped in communities by these predatory employers that we hear far too much about, exploiting them for cheap labour and housing them in less-than-livable hostels. But this government has addressed that concern. We are now marketing Australia as amongst the most attractive destinations in the world for young holiday-makers to live and to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: we are competing against other nations to appeal to these young people—countries like Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. All of these countries have robust taxation systems designed to give working holiday-makers a low tax bracket. The good news is that we know that our wages are higher, our economy is stronger and our growth is faster. We can compete on an international level with these countries. Australia is leading the pack in more ways than one, but we need to ensure that we remain competitive, because we need these young people as part of our resource pool of workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a fabulous result and is a testament to the hard work and the dedication of many regional and Liberal members in this place. As I said at the outset, I'm particularly disappointed that the Labor Party have decided not to support this bill. We on this side do support this bill. This bill is very sensible, and it certainly supports the employers and alleviates their concerns. This whole initiative is a great credit to those on this side—especially the regional members here—who support those regional communities who desperately need the backpacker community. On that basis, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="2V5" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SWAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I rise to oppose the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017, which seeks to strip away protections from a uniquely vulnerable group of people in Australia, working holiday-makers. This bill is ripped, if you like, straight out of the trickle-down playbook of the Turnbull government. To businesses who wish to employ working holiday-makers, the Turnbull government says, 'We'll quietly remove the need for you to publicly list on the Australian Business Register.' The Turnbull government says to these businesses: 'You can be a nonentity. You can employ working holiday-makers, treat them however you like and pay them whatever you like.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of shedding light on the galling practices of these employers, the Turnbull government is going to shed darkness. That's par for the course with this government. At the mention of any movement towards the bright light of transparency, whether it's for big business or for shonky operators, the government recoils like a vampire. The government sides with shonky operators, basically because it's prepared to tolerate this exploitation. We've seen them oppose Labor's moves on tax transparency. When we proposed that public companies tell us what they pay in tax, the coalition ran away from the light. We saw their resistance to transparency, indeed, in the parliament this afternoon, when the Treasurer couldn't or wouldn't reveal the cost of his company tax cuts or the yearly cost of the income tax cuts. We're seeing it in this bill as well. It is a chance for the Turnbull government to step into the light and expose employers who overwork, underpay, harm and mistreat working holiday-makers in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not take a backward step in exposing and opposing the practices of these businesses. We will expose and oppose the practices of the Turnbull government, as they are, in some instances, allied with exploitative employers. This bill is merely another bungle that the Turnbull government has banged on the back of the backpacker tax. The package that passed the parliament in 2016 required a mandatory registration process for employers of working holiday-makers. Visa holders could check the public register to see if a business was a legitimate employer of working holiday-makers. There are real concerns about the unconscionable exploitation of working holiday-makers by some businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill strips working holiday-makers of the ability to look up details of a registered employer and will affect their ability to choose an employer who will charge the correct level of tax and pay them a fair wage. The register was one aspect of the original bill that did allow for greater protection of working holiday-makers against exploitation. Given the significant cases of exploitation in this area, that is why we stand in strong opposition to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government claims to be the champion of choice, but of course it says for big business, 'You're free to choose,' but it says to workers: 'You're simply free to lose. You're free to lose your hard-fought-for penalty rates for weekend work and overtime. You're free to lose your sense of job security, whether that's safety at work or the security of having a job at all. And you're free to lose your job if the employer can find and exploit a migrant worker who can do it cheaper and who won't complain.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, almost one in six Australians are underemployed or want to work more hours. One in six—that's almost 1.9 million Australians on the fringes of the labour market in this country. And, if you're aged 15 to 24, you have a one in three chance of wanting more work. That is 660,000 Australians. These numbers are the shame of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a chance to reflect on these matters this weekend in Queensland. Last Monday was Labour Day. It was a chance for the labour movement to reaffirm what history tells us: working people can make a difference, and working people can change a country. All of the great reforms of the 20th century came from the labour movement, the unions and the Labor Party working together: a decent minimum wage, Medicare, a fairer and more progressive tax system, a strong voice for working people—the list is long. On Labour Day we acknowledged that the labour movement frequently has to defeat powerful vested interests that seek to crush the voice of the people. Indeed, this bill has been subject to the power of those powerful vested interests in the amendments we are debating today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For us it's a difficult task because we have to organise against people who are well funded, wealthy and powerful corporations who control the public megaphone, who seek to drown out our voice. But on this side of the House we choose to fight those people, to take them on in the parliament and particularly to take on those who run the Turnbull government, including the cheerleaders and puppeteers in the Business Council of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, I've focused a lot on these issues in the parliament. I've talked a lot about the imbalance of power, the imbalance of influence and the imbalance of class. It's not because I'm particularly chippy or resentful, and it's not because I've become a Marxist. It's simply because class is now a live issue in our nation, and I see it pounding the lives of people in the community I represent and around the country. I see it with my constituents. I see it in the youth unemployment figures. I see it in the insecure work which now comprises something like 40 per cent of the workforce. It is a real issue in Australia. It's changing our politics, and it's changing our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been particularly fired up about it since the global financial crisis because what I have found in our country is something that is quite ugly. It's something that I wasn't prepared to have found but something that I've seen that is new. That is a growing self-interest and arrogance of what I would call an overpaid and overpowerful corporate elite, who are generally the people who are dictating the policies of the Turnbull government. These people have been in the dock at the royal commission into banking throughout the last few weeks. Their arrogance and their blindness of affluence has infected corporate life in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these are the people that working people have to deal with every day. They seek to bolster their self-interest at every turn. The culture of too many boardrooms is not just selfish but now obviously ranks with malpractice, as we have seen at the royal commission. There's a sick race to the bottom going on to minimise tax, to casualise their workforces—all the way through that process, barracking for lower wages and, of course, cuts to investments in health and education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In office, and over the last five years, the Labor Party in this parliament has fought for the big structural reforms that we need to secure a prosperous and fairer economy and society. But at no stage through any of that process have the overpowered corporate elite who run this government put their hand up for the very big structural long-term reforms that are required to secure our future. They wouldn't stick their hand up for negative gearing, a sensible price on carbon, the Gonski education reforms—the list is long. What we do see in Australia, like the rest of the developed world for that matter, is a capitalist economy which is dominated now by a plutocratic family model backed up by an overpowered and overpaid corporate elite. They do want an economy run by the rich, for the rich, and that's what we're getting. And nothing from the budget last night sticks out more than the obscene tax changes put in place to flatten the progressive tax system and hand massive tax cuts to people who earn incomes like ours and well above.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was growing up, my father had an attitude about the world he lived in. He went to war. He came back. He was distrustful of the big banks and the big oil companies. His generation had witnessed the Depression and the Second World War. They fought for freedom when they went overseas. They came back. They had plans for a big society, a great society, in which the fruits of that economy were fairly shared amongst working people. They fought for that. They changed it. They fought for it and they were successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 30 years, that has been wound back. The beneficiaries have been a relatively small elite on very high incomes who dictate this government's budget and dictate this government's tax policy. It was there last night in black and white for everybody to see the rank unfairness of it—the destruction of the personal progressive income tax system, where someone on $37,000 would pay the same rate as someone on $200,000! To present that budget to this parliament in an environment where there is growing inequality around the world, which is polarising politics, is simply insane. It shows you how far to the right those opposite have drifted and how far they have come from the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this simple bill this one amendment that we are objecting to today says it all. Why couldn't there be a register so we can stamp out malpractice? Why couldn't that continue in the bill? I'll tell you why. It's because some vested interest got hold of them, or some loony in the Senate dictated to them that it must be changed. What I really find troubling about our country, and particularly the activities of organisations like the Business Council, is that at every turn they smear collective action. At every turn they smear the role and importance of government and, in particular, collective action from trade unions. They tell a great lie about our society. They say it's divided between makers and takers. This Ayn Rand view of the world goes to the core of where they come from, how they make policy and how they present their budgets. Of course, they are the makers. And they just think the takers should take what they can get—and business should of course do whatever they want. And that goes back to the amendment in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House know we need collective action. We know we need unions. There's a power imbalance in our country. Franklin Roosevelt said it all in the 1930s:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our first truth is that the liberty of democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to the point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are very profound words—and very profound public action flowed from those words. Progressive taxation came from those words. Breaking up monopolies came from those words. The union movement came from those words. But this government is now controlled by trickle-downers and plutocrats. F. Scott Fitzgerald said of plutocrats: 'They think they're better than we'—that is, they think they are the wealth creators and the rest of us are just leaners, hanging around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I want to say very clearly in this House that history shows that working people can make a difference, and we'll make a difference again. We will run down this budget because of its rank unfairness and because there is a profound sense of unease, insecurity and unfairness in our society. This bill before us today is a reaffirmation of why we need a strong labour movement that's proud of its history and unapologetic about where it stands and who it represents: the economic interests of working people. History will be made again as we turn back the trickle-down policies of this extreme right-wing government that occupies the government benches.</span>

He closed off by saying that this government, the Turnbull government, is an extreme right-wing machine. It is not a view that is shared by the entire electorate. I think this government is entirely centrist, so I reject those remarks completely. But it was very stirring. It would have been very good when he was at university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017, let me speak for a start about working holiday-makers in my electorate of Grey. They are absolutely essential. I'm not sure they should be, but they certainly are, as seasonal farm workers and fruit pickers, working in small wineries, as harvest helpers in the grains industries and working at grain receival sites. Many of them just would not operate without the backpackers, quite frankly. They work as jackaroos on remote pastoral properties and as shed hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But probably the most critical of those backpacker workers in my electorate are those that work in the tourism and hospitality industry, particularly those that work in the more remote areas. Let me say that if we go north of Port Augusta—a very important tourist area for South Australia and the nation, with the northern Flinders Ranges and towns like Coober Pedy, Innamincka and Oodnadatta—you would be well aware of them. These are important places. They are important service spots just so people of this nation and overseas nations can explore our outback. By and large, the operators that work in those areas provide quality service. There are some very good and luxurious tourism operators that work in these areas. But, quite frankly, they just cannot get Australian workers to take the jobs. Often they are not full-time jobs, because the tourist industry gets pretty quiet over the summer months when the temperature gets up towards 50 degrees, but they need a source of labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a constant conundrum to me as the member for Grey that we just can't entice our young unemployed people to have a go, to venture forth, to leave the fires of home and to go and have a look what the Australian outback looks like, or other areas for that matter. This could be the most important step of their lives. At this stage, the latest figures I can find are that we have about 14 per cent youth unemployment in most of the centres across Grey. Starting your working life with a long period of unemployment is likely to have lifetime ramifications. You can imagine. An employer advertises a job. A 23- or 24-year-old wanders in, having finished education at high school, and the employer says to him, 'What have you been doing for the last five or six years?' 'Well, nothing. I've been unemployed.' They will go immediately to the back of the queue, because that potential employer thinks this person can't get out of bed. It may not be a fair assumption, but it is a hole on the potential employee's CV. It could be filled by all kinds of opportunities that exist out there in the economy. It may be in the part-time economy, but often those jobs lead to fuller jobs. So I don't know why we cannot seem to excite that young, unattached brigade to go and have a go. I sat next to a woman—I don't want to offend her, but she was around 30 years old—up at Coober Pedy just last weekend. She had left the city. She wanted a job. She went out and had a go. She can now drive a four-trailer road train. What a story! She said, 'I'm having a go at being a jackeroo at the moment.' Being prepared to get out and have a go has turned this individual, who was a city liver, into someone with wide experience. That's what our youth should be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know we're speaking about the backpacker trade here now, but I draw this link because it is of great concern to me when I see so many people not taking opportunities to enhance their lives and to grow their possibilities. I ran a survey for 18- to 30-year-olds a couple of years ago. One of the questions I asked was: if there is no employment near where you live, should you be expected to move to find a job? It was very concerning to me that over 70 per cent of those replied no. It really makes you wonder what their expectation of the world is. Is it that the government should supply a job? To do a job you actually need a chore; you need a task. Governments can do that, and some governments have done it in the past—they supply the job of digging a hole and then they get another gang to fill it in again. But if you want proper employment you need to be doing a useful task. It concerns me that 70 per cent of those young people said, 'No, I think somebody should find a job for me close to home.' It's very concerning because all these jobs exist, but we are having to use imported labour to fill them, largely through the backpacker trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, you're around my vintage, so I'm sure you would remember Professor Julius Sumner Miller. As the American professor would have said: why is it so? It is a great conundrum. Why is it so? Why can't we galvanise these people? I don't want to get drawn into the debate and I've certainly wandered a fair way off the topic today, but it is interesting that some have been making the case for lifting the Newstart allowance, and they're perfectly entitled to do so. By the same token, we can't get people to take that risk and have a go, and it just makes you wonder what the drivers are. Where's the compelling piece of government policy that will get people to engage? At the end of the day, I strongly back the case for the businesses in these remote communities that can't get people to work with them, because Australians, for whatever reason, don't particularly like that line of work, to be able to access this itinerant, if you like, occasional labour pool.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does address some of the issues that have arisen as a result of striking a withholding tax that is applicable, especially to holiday-makers. That rate, of course, is 15 per cent on the first $37,000 of income. For an employer to apply this rate, they must be registered as a working holiday-maker visa employer. The alternative for that employer, if they choose not to be registered, is to withhold 32 per cent, so it's an obvious incentive for working holiday-makers to seek out employment with these employers. This bill and the working holiday-maker employer register are designed to make sure they are not exploited. Most employers—certainly the ones I know—do the right thing. They are very pleased to have these people on staff and treat these employees as we would expect them to be treated. But we're all aware of some very high profile cases where that has not been the case. They've been highlighted on some very high profile television shows. This government has no tolerance at all for that kind of behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation and the establishment of the working holiday-maker employer register are about stamping out that type of behaviour and empowering the worker. It links employers to the tax office. They will supply their employer records to the tax office so that government, through the tax office, can monitor what they're doing. We will know where to watch for those people who are likely to exploit this labour force. We will be on their case. I have no tolerance for it—absolutely none—and that view is shared by my colleagues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Empowering workers reduces the likelihood of abuse. Less offending means better support from the public for this very important workforce contribution. To explain that, if we had high-profile cases popping up on television and showing the exploitative nature of employers, public support for backpackers working in Australia would basically fall away and the businesses that rely on this labour force would be at threat. Like most things with government, it's important that we get it right so the public has faith in what the government, the legislation and the bureaucracy are doing. At the end of the day, this workforce supports very viable and very important businesses that sit in my electorate and every other electorate around Australia, I should imagine, but particularly in regional and remote electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the opportunity for people to come to Australia on a holiday, work while they're here, learn a bit about our culture—some people would say that in some places they would learn about the lack of culture—and learn that we are people who respect all who come to this nation and that we look after them properly while they're here. I support the legislation.</span>

                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  Here we are again, having to deal with the government's incompetence when it comes to backpackers and backpacker visas in this country. It was on budget night a few years ago when we sat here in horror as the Treasurer announced a 32 per cent tax rate for backpackers, which of course we knew would decimate the labour that is required on our farm industries. From beginning to end, this government have been appalling when it comes to backpackers and the backpacker tax. It demonstrates that they completely misunderstand the purpose of the visa and why people come here. Originally, people came here on a working holiday for a cultural exchange. Young people under 30 would come over here independently and they'd work a bit and they'd travel a bit. But it has changed dramatically, and the government have just incentivised that in so many ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is opposed to this legislation for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that it is a dirty deal. It is a deal that ensures the exploitation of holiday-makers, and people wanting to understand more about a potential employer will find it hidden. We need more transparency in this sector, not less. We all have seen the horror stories brought out by the media. I want to acknowledge the role the media has played in exposing some of the absolutely heartbreaking experiences of guest workers and holiday-makers in this country. In the agricultural sector there have been some horrific examples of exploitation, threats of violence, violence and, in some cases, sexual assault.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge that it is not all growers. In fact, most growers and producers are outraged by the exploitation. I met last week with AUSVEG and the VFF at a roundtable in Melbourne. They said, 'We need to end this stain on our industry. These dodgy growers are making it hard for the rest of us.' One of the other comments that was made by AUSVEG and the VFF was that we need to find a skilled workforce that can work on our farms every year. The problem is that the government have made our ag industry beholden to one visa. They have failed to come up with a decent agricultural workforce policy. For a lot of our farmers, this is the only access that they have to labour, not just for harvest but all year round. Some of the growers in Victoria say that they feel like they're camp counsellors. Backpackers rotate around farms trying to get their 88 days. They don't have to work for just one employer for the 88 days. Farmers may hire someone in good faith and invest in the training, and after four days or 10 days that person quits because they've reached their 88 days and they can get their visa extension. That's just one of the problems with the way in which this visa has been constructed. We all remember the debate. It was the Farmers' Federation and the growers saying, 'Do not touch our backpackers.' But designs in the way this government have changed this visa mean that fewer and fewer people are working on the farms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other changes that the government had as part of this package was allowing backpackers to qualify for the extension, to do their 88 days, by working in northern Australia. So as a young backpacker over here you've got the choice: pick fruit or pull beers. Guess what they're doing, Deputy Speaker? They are working in the pubs and hospitality outlets in northern Australia. They are not going out and doing the hard work on farms. Why would you? If you get to qualify for the second year, why would you go work in agriculture? I can understand why our farmers feel cheated when it comes to this government and how they've behaved around the backpacker tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lack of absolute transparency when it comes to backpackers and their experiences. The Fair Work Ombudsman doesn't have enough resources to investigate the exploitation that is going on in the sector. This is why this bill is before us. It's going to make it harder for there to be transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other problem that we have with the backpacker visa is the fact that it is now being used as a labour visa. We have people coming in in bulk numbers from places like Taiwan, Korea and Bulgaria, and working in industries where they are literally taking jobs from locals. There is a renewable energy solar farm that is being built outside of Townsville by 400 Bulgarian backpackers. No young, local, unemployed people in Townsville were given that job opportunity. No local electricians were given an opportunity to train and recruit apprentices. There are no Australian workers on that job; just 400 Bulgarian backpackers. When they finish that job, they'll be put on a plane and sent somewhere else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The backpacker visa in this country is being used as a backdoor to cheap labour. We have to look at what is happening in our food processing and manufacturing sectors. Don KR and Hardwick Meatworks are in my electorate. Don KR had a union collective agreement where casuals were being paid a certain rate. Then they found out that they could use a labour hire firm that paid the award rate. The difference between the award rate and the union rate was $5 an hour. So those workers got ripped off and the locals lost jobs, but it's completely legal. The way in which backpacker labour is being used in our country to undermine collective agreements and to undermine locals for local jobs is simply outrageous. Yet what we've got before us is not a bill that addresses that issue; what we have before us is the cover-up—the cheap deal that they've done in the Senate. That's what we've got before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the example of Hardwick. Hardwick is a meat processor in my electorate. They directly employ all of their backpackers. They said, 'If we have to have people who are here on working holiday visas, we will at least pay them the same as the other workers.' Credit to them for doing that. However, they are now struggling to recruit people because of a quasi relationship. Because of the way in which labour hire recruits these overseas backpackers to come into our country, they now are struggling to get access to people coming in. In saying that, another thing I want to acknowledge about Hardwick is that they are a bit like our farmers in that they would actually prefer to have permanent residents working in these jobs. Recently they hired a number of Karen refugees who, through our humanitarian program, have settled in Bendigo in central Victoria. They are now recruiting Hazaras who have settled in Bendigo in central Victoria. They are now starting to take on some of this work. The last time I visited Hardwick, just a few weeks ago, they had six backpackers come on and six backpackers leave. The constant cost involved in training backpackers to work in food manufacturing, agriculture and other industries because they are trying to satisfy their 88 days is costing business a lot, and it is costing productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the problem for this government. It is always just short-sighted policy. They're not thinking long term about work and having a skilled workforce. They're not working with industry to say, 'What are your labour gaps?' The previous speaker said, 'I don't understand why we can't get young Australians to work in these industries.' It is probably because you've gutted TAFE. Even last night, in your budget, you cut an extra $270 million from TAFE. It is probably because you've completely smashed regional universities. It is probably because you've broken the trainers that connect young people to the jobs that exist. You've not only done that—it's a double whammy—you've also created the incentive for labour hire companies to come in and undercut the collective agreements that exist in these places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to get back to in this country is this visa coming back to its original purpose: allowing young people to come here for a working holiday, work and travel. We have reciprocal rights, with young Australians going over to the UK. But what we are seeing happening with people on this visa is either exploitation or cheap sources of labour. It really concerns me when I hear examples of people who are working in social work for the New South Wales not-for-profit sector. They're working as social workers, and the visa that allows them to work as social workers is the working holiday-maker visa. That's not a cultural experience. We have serious issues in our country if the only way that you can engage someone to work in an industry is through a backpacker visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to have a serious look. If we have a skills shortage in our country, what is wrong with recruiting someone to give them the opportunity to live here permanently? Why make them go through the process of working for two different employers for six months? Why make them go through the process of working in northern Australia or in agriculture for 88 days? If there is a skills shortage in an industry, let's be serious about that. Let's work out if we can train local workers for it and, if we can't get locals to do the job, let's look for someone who's from overseas but give them the chance to permanently move here. Give them the chance to stay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All employers of working holiday-makers are still required under this proposal to register with the ATO to ensure that they pay their tax. However, it removes the ability for a working holiday-maker to look up the details of their employer to make sure that they are paying the correct level of tax and are an employer of choice. Senate inquiry after Senate inquiry has exposed the exploitative nature of this visa. We as a country need to get serious about cracking down on that exploitation, but nothing before us deals with that. The backpacker tax is one of the biggest failures of this government in the way in which it has decimated the workforce that our farmers and the agricultural industry need, and the way in which it has been exploited and is literally taking locals from local jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot of talk at the moment about meat processing. I used the example of my electorate, but in the electorate of New England there are 100 per cent labour hire meat processors in that electorate, with people who are here on a backpacking visa. Those workers have come here to make money and to take it home. That's a long way from the original intent of the visa, which was about a cultural exchange. The way in which this visa is being exploited and manipulated by big business is wrong. If we have a skills shortage or a labour shortage in this country, as I have said, and we cannot fill it with local workers first then we should look at a visa, but a visa that is fair and that gives people the opportunity to migrate here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a country that's been built on migration: Ten Pound Poms and our postwar migrants that came here. People came here as skilled migrants and, if they left the country, we said, 'Okay, we've sponsored you; now you have to hand it back.' Today the experience for migrants is much, much worse. Today the experience for migrants is too often a series of visas which see them exploited. As a country, we have to get serious about how we manage migration. This bill that the government has put forward, as I've said, is basically trying to push it further underground. It is going to make it harder for workers to understand and know more about their employers. Given these significant cases of exploitation, Labor is saying we strongly oppose the measures in this bill. We have to have transparency. We have to give young people who are here as guest workers the opportunity to know who their employer is. We also have to review the exact nature of this visa. It has to be restored to its original intent, which is about a cultural exchange. I do share sympathy with our good growers that are out there and with employers like Hardwicks, who are now struggling to recruit people to come and work because of the changes that this government has made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was in Cairns a few weeks ago meeting with workers about problems with labour hire, I met a young woman who actually was working in Indigenous health. She's over here from the United States. For her to stay for the second year, though, she had to work 88 days in hospitality. It just doesn't make sense. Once upon a time, she would have gone and worked on a farm, but why would she, given that she can work in hospitality? We have to get serious about our migration program in this country. We also have to get serious about this visa. It needs to be restored to its original intent of being a cultural exchange, a holiday-making visa. We want to see an end to the situation which we have at the moment where big labour-hire firms are recruiting bulk numbers of workers to come over here and work in areas which young Australians could be working in. Young Australians do want to work at Hardwicks. Young Australians do want to work at Don KR. Young Australians do want to be social workers and work as schoolteachers. But, at the moment, they can't, and, in many cases, it's because of the exploitation of backpackers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I'll make a brief contribution. I, of course, acknowledge my good friend the member for Moreton for giving me the opportunity to jump the queue. I'm taking that opportunity for a couple of reasons. The first is that those opposite seem to have a bit of a memory of convenience around this issue. I've sat through about 60 minutes of this debate now, and the way that it's been put is that action has been taken by people like the AWU. It wasn't the Australian Workers' Union. It's been put that action has been taken by people like the now CFMMEU. It wasn't them. It might have been United Voice. I can tell you that it wasn't United Voice. It wasn't any of those organisations. The crackdown on the exploitation of foreign workers in this country commenced with my colleagues on this side of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As one of the speakers said in recent contributions, there have been any number of reports into this issue. There have been Senate reports after Senate reports, inquiries and standing committees right back to the late 1990s, when it was raised by the former member of this House Philip Ruddock. But what I can tell you is that some of my colleagues, including the now Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the now Deputy Prime Minister, Mr McCormack, and my good friend and colleague in the other place Senator Barry O'Sullivan, kicked this off with industry, calling for direct action and, in particular, a multijurisdictional task force to crack down on exploitation of foreign workers in this country. That is precisely what happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We worked our way through this with industry. We consulted with them as to what they needed. What they didn't need was more red tape. What they didn't want was more people affecting how they work and what their operations are each and every day—delivering jobs and, of course, building the economy in this country. So the multijurisdictional task force we called for at the federal Nationals conference some years ago, with unanimous support, was delivered by this government. Taskforce Cadena has been a real success in cracking down on foreign worker exploitation in this country. If you wanted to look at one case in particular, it would be that of one Mr Emmanuel Bani and the people from Vanuatu who he exploited, who he left on the side of the road, who ended up in my office, who hadn't been paid for months, who were disregarded and left without their passports. The absolute outcome of that is Mr Bani has found himself in court. He has been prosecuted successfully, as he should have been. But it is this side of the House that is cracking down on foreign worker exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, I will give a shout-out and, certainly, a call-out to Keith Ballin, the representative of the AWU in Bundaberg for many, many years, who did come to see me after we took action on this issue. I'll acknowledge that he put out his hand and said: 'We will help you on this issue. Come to us again.' I certainly acknowledge that that was a very gracious and generous offer. But it was the people on this side of the House who took action, and I think we should acknowledge the people who were willing to put themselves out in front of the media. The member for Blair's contribution was almost accurate. It wasn't <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span>; it was ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>. The reason I remember it so very clearly is that I was on it, talking about the exploitation of foreign workers and what needed to happen. We had all heard the horror stories around those situations, and they were unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we done? We introduced Taskforce Cadena, a multi-jurisdictional crackdown task force, which has been successful. I acknowledge the member for Gippsland—Taskforce Cadena has been active in Gippsland, in the Riverina and in areas right across this country. We added on an additional $20 million to the Fair Work Ombudsman so they could do their work. There is still work to do; I absolutely acknowledge that. One of the things that stood out for me in the budget last night was the change to cash payments—no more than $10,000 will be allowed in future. That will address two critical things: the accumulation of cash and phoenixing. If you can't pay for substantial components, equipment and machinery with cash in this country, that will eliminate a lot of the problems we have, particularly in horticulture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge another contribution, which stated that this is just a few bad seeds, that it is not reflective of the horticulture industry in this country. The majority of our growers are out there doing the right thing, working very hard for this country. They take a lot of risk. They employ a lot of people. But we do need to ensure that they are able to act on a level playing field, and that is what we are doing as a government. This bill continues that good work, and I commend the bill to the House. But it should be acknowledged by those opposite that it was this side that took action on cracking down on foreign worker exploitation in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017, and I'll say from the start that Labor opposes this bill. Whilst I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Hinkler and the personal interaction that we've had on this particular topic—I've got a big toe in his community and I work in his community. I acknowledge that, on a personal basis, we have worked well on this. But I don't think we'll ever celebrate governments cracking down on people who are breaking the law. That's like giving people a pat on the back for breathing. Governments should always punish people who break the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the parliament essentially introduces changes to the backpacker tax from the package that passed parliament back in 2016. I think it's important to view this next instalment in the context of the entire backpacker tax fiasco, which sounds like a holiday novel. Sadly, it's something presided over by the Turnbull government, and it's been a disaster from the beginning, with the backpacker tax first appearing in 2015, announced by the then-Abbott government in the 2015 budget. Since then, the government's got a new leader but old ideas. It's still cuts, cuts and more cuts—cuts to education for every kid, totalling $17 billion, right across Australia, including $15 million from schools in Moreton; cuts to higher education and universities, such as $92 million from Griffith University, of which the Nathan campus is in my electorate, and TAFE, include $270 million in additional cuts announced last night; cuts to hospitals, including over $3 million from QEII, which is in Moreton; and cuts to Medicare totalling $2.2 billion. Thanks to the freezing of the Medicare rebate, everyone will be paying more to see a GP at a time when wages are stagnant. There are also proposed cuts to Queensland's share of GST funding, potentially ripping $1.5 billion from the state's economy, and the proposed cutting of the energy supplement, taking $375 every year out of the pockets of pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2015 budget announcement, the then Abbott government proposed a 32.5 per cent tax on backpackers. There was failed negotiation after failed negotiation, and, on the last sitting day of 2016, it was jammed through in a secret deal with the Greens political party. Yes—the coalition doing a deal with the Greens political party! The shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, described it as a special mix of arrogance and incompetence from the government of the day. Labor, responsibly, had offered the government many different compromises to stop the outrageous 32.5 per cent slug on the industry, which would obviously be passed on. We offered 10.5 per cent or even, in the spirit of compromise, 13 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the Treasurer say? 'Oh, no, they'd both be far too expensive.' What did Treasurer Morrison do? It's quite astounding. He did a deal with the Greens political party to water down superannuation measures and to spend $100 million extra on Landcare. I love Landcare; it does great work; I understand that. But this deal, the Morrison deal, ended up costing the budget more money than doing a deal on 13 per cent would have or doing a deal on 10 per cent would have. It takes that special mixture of arrogance and incompetence to get a deal that has a higher tax rate while making less money for the budget bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that used to be at emergency levels of debt. Do you remember that, Deputy Speaker? Remember that old debt-and-deficit truck? Remember the pictures of Mr Turnbull out in front of the debt-and-deficit truck? Where is that truck? Is it locked in a bunker somewhere, its diesel engine ticking over, chugging away, collecting parking fines in a parking lot somewhere—fines that my grandchildren's children will have to pay off? No.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, back to the backpacker tax: this hapless coalition government managed to negotiate a deal that was worse for taxpayers, worse for farmers and worse for the tourism sector, a trifecta of trip-ups. So what is there left to do—make it worse for the workers too? It's an idea that this coalition government is never too afraid to tackle: making life worse for workers, making life worse for ordinary Australians. When it comes to properly funding education, when it comes to funding health or infrastructure, it goes missing. But, when it comes to bashing workers, it turns up in droves. We've seen negotiation after negotiation, and this floundering Turnbull government yet again wants to remove an avenue for the protection of workers and something that provides greater transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are seeking to deny working holiday-makers something they promised: a public register that allows visa holders to review who is registered for the program. This register ensures, before they apply for work, that they are paid appropriately. It ensures that they can have greater protections, given the cases of abuse and exploitation in this area. As I mentioned at the start of my speech, I have a particular interest because I have in my electorate a significant Taiwanese community and Korean community, and many of their friends or relatives come and work on Australian farms. Because of that, I went for a visit to Bundaberg and the Lockyer Valley with representatives from the Taiwanese community to find out how people were being treated. I'll come back to that in a little while.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The backpacker tax package that passed parliament in 2016 allowed visa holders to check the public register to see if a business was registered for employing working holiday-makers. This amendment, outlined in this bill, is part of a deal that secured Senator Leyonhjelm's support for the original package—yet another deal from this government, which is willing to sell out to anyone for almost any price to get something through the Senate. It needs to read some negotiating books.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There absolutely needs to be a better process for ensuring that greater protections and information are in place for working holiday-makers. Why? It is not just because it's the right thing to do. That's a pretty good start. But we need to do it because these backpackers become our de facto ambassadors forever. If they have a horrible experience here in Australia, they will tell the world. They will tell their home. They will tell everyone that they meet what happened to them in Australia. That's why we need backpackers to do something productive, get paid and have a good time but also be great ambassadors for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill removes these protections. It removes the ability of backpackers to check the register and leaves them in the dark again. Unsurprisingly, the Turnbull government is prioritising—guess what?—big business over workers. So now the coalition is revisiting the dark days of the backpacker tax fiasco. This hillbilly-harbourside alliance is back in town.</span>
                </p>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                    </a>  You liked that one, Member for Gippsland? The impact of fewer backpackers working in Australia has dire consequences for our horticulture growers. I know this because the Brisbane Markets, where a lot of this produce ends up, are in my electorate, and I've had feedback from several growers about some of the concerns they have, as I also had on my visit to the Lockyer Valley and Bundaberg. Growers face the prospect of seeing their fruit rot on their trees if they don't have anyone to pick it. The uncertainty that the Turnbull government continues to create has caused unnecessary stress for farmers, whose very livelihoods are at stake, especially—I am informed by my colleagues—in Tasmania but also in the north-west of Western Australia and some of the more remote parts of Queensland and no doubt everywhere in between.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the Turnbull government, and particularly dumped former Deputy Prime Minister Joyce, handled this issue very badly. He is not a great negotiator. He failed to fully consult with stakeholders or to do any modelling when he put forward proposals to tax backpackers. When this went on, we saw that the Nationals—that once-great party of the bush and the home town I grew up in—completely ignored their constituents, the growers. The premise of any proposals completely ignored the fact that backpackers who come to Australia to work, usually then spend the money they earn in Australia and—guess what—often spend it in the bush. If you're out in St George picking grapes, you stay in St George and spend it in the pubs there and in accommodation there. It is Australian businesses that benefit from these backpackers' holidays, and all the goods and services sold to them—the holiday products, the alcohol, the food, the tourist experiences—attract GST, support a lot of small businesses and are good for our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I mention the GST, I again appeal to Prime Minister Turnbull and to all of the Queensland Liberal National Party MPs and senators to drop any plans to slash Queensland's fair share of the GST, which is flagged as making our state's economy $1.5 billion worse off. That would be the equivalent of losing 5,000 teachers, 5,000 nurses, 3,000 police officers and 1,135 firefighters. It's clear that Prime Minister Turnbull and the LNP government don't care about frontline services in the Sunshine State.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before us today, we have the Liberal government and their very muted National Party coalition partners revisiting this backpacker tax policy area. In 2016-17, a total of 211,011 subclass 417 and subclass 462 working holiday-maker visas were granted. That's a 1.7 per cent reduction compared to 2015-16, which in itself saw a 5.4 per cent reduction from the preceding year. So there was a one per cent reduction in first working holiday visa grants, subclass 417, to 157,858, and a six per cent reduction in the second holiday working visa grants, down to 34,097—red flags for any minister, surely, whether it be the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources or the Minister for Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016-17, the top five countries for first working holiday visa grants were: the UK, down 4.5 per cent; Germany, down 0.9 per cent; France, actually, up 5.5 per cent; South Korea, up 3.8 per cent; and Taiwan, down 3.3 per cent. In 2016-17, the top five countries for that second working holiday visa were: the UK, down 3.3 per cent; Taiwan down 0.3 per cent; South Korea, down 6.8 per cent; France, down 6.1 per cent; and Japan, down 1.9 per cent. Not a good tale at all. To apply for a working holiday visa, you must have a valid passport from a country that's involved in the working holiday program. Not every country that we have diplomatic relations with is able to access this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of Australia's large Taiwanese diaspora lives in my electorate of Moreton, which also has a significant Korean population. As I just mentioned, Taiwan is one of the top five sources of working holiday visas, both first and second. A few years ago, due to the stories I was hearing about the Taiwanese using this visa scheme being exploited, I travelled north to Bundaberg with Ken Lai, who was the then director general of Brisbane's Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. We also visited the Lockyer Valley and caught up with many of the backpackers working and picking on farms. We went out to the farms, mainly Bundaberg and the area's tomato farms, but also a few other crops down in the Lockyer Valley. We met the young backpackers, we went out for dinner with them and we chatted to them about the hourly rates and the potential for exploitation in this industry—particularly, when being paid piecemeal rates under the horticultural award. Sadly, the evidence I heard made me realise that there are unscrupulous operators, and that—and I'll say this to support the member for Hinkler—often it's actually a middle person rather than the grower who's actually doing the exploiting. Sometimes it is a fellow countryman of the Taiwanese and Koreans, and they take advantage of these optimistic, fun-loving, usually young backpackers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Ombudsman recently released a report into the wages and conditions of people working under the working holiday visa program, and they'd received nearly 2,000 requests for assistance from visa holders in 2016 and recovered $3 million owed to these visa holders—so about $1,500 each. When this program was expanded a decade ago, it introduced an option for young visa holders to extend their stay. If they did it in regional Australia, they got an extra 88 days. That made them more open to being abused, particularly people from Asian countries like Korea and Taiwan. They didn't understand the workplace rights of Australia and so there was more likelihood that they could be duped or abused. That is not what the program was set up for. Unfortunately, it's sometimes hard to get information about workplace rights into the hands of working holiday-backpackers in their language. Sadly, sometimes they go straight from the airport, into the middleman's van and then off to the agricultural areas. It's hard to get them the information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the facts. We've had review after review. We can't just hope for the best; we need to have tighter scrutiny and increased transparency. Prime Minister Abbott's 2015 budget package allowed the date of effect of an employer's registration to be made publicly available on the Australian Businesses Register so at least visa holders could check that public register to see if a business was registered. Sadly, this bill removes the requirement for the public listing of the business on the Australian Business Register, which was a bit of transparency that would help catch the rogues. As we know, you have to enforce it for the cowboys, not for those that want to do good. This bill will remove the ability of working holiday-makers to look up those details. It erodes the ability for greater protection. As I mentioned here today, it's an industry rife with significant cases of exploitation and, as such, Labor opposes this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I also rise to oppose the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. This is another episode in this government's total mismanagement of the working holiday tourism sector in Australia. Before I get into the register issue, I want to briefly take you back. Members will recall the fiasco of the backpacker tax in the 2015 budget. In that budget, the government announced that it would treat working holiday-makers, backpackers, as nonresidents for tax purposes. This meant that they would have been taxed at 32.5 per cent from the first dollar they earned. When the government said that, that message went all around the world. Damage is often done when you send out a message like that to the working holiday-makers who obviously have other options available to them. Then the government decided it would tax backpackers at 19 per cent on earnings up to $37,000 and at marginal tax rates above that. Then, in a deal to get the bill through the Senate, the government agreed that that rate would be 15 per cent. I and many of my other colleagues were trying to get it as low as possible, knowing the damage done from that initial announcement. This whole process could, in fact, be used as a case study of how not to formulate policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard some of those opposite, such as the member for Grey, say that the working holiday-maker sector is absolutely essential, and the member for Durack said that backpackers are vital, that regional Australia can't do without them—and they're right. So why did those opposite trash the reputation of Australia as an attractive destination for backpackers? Unfortunately, the perception now is that we are a high-tax country and that other countries like Canada and New Zealand are much more attractive for backpackers. If the members opposite don't realise that that reputational damage was done then they're even more out of touch than I thought they were. I'll come back in a moment to the disastrous effects of this ill-conceived and totally mismanaged policy on our tourism industry and on our Northern Territory economy, but I'll add that I agree with the Nationals senator Barry O'Sullivan, who recently said in Darwin that the backpacker tax was one of the worst decisions made by this federal government—made by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, though, I will go to the specific intent of this bill. This bill is nothing more than the result of a sleazy deal with Senator Leyonhjelm to get the bill through the Senate. One of the few positive aspects of this whole policy shambles was that working holiday-makers would have been able to consult a register of employers to see if a business was registered to employ working holiday-makers. But the effect of this bill is to remove that safeguard for working holiday-makers. Many backpackers, as workers, have been exploited, underpaid, forced to live in squalid lodgings and, in some cases, sexually harassed and assaulted. We've heard from those opposite that they understand that. They agree that that has happened. They've heard the stories. This register would have at least enabled employees to look up details of an employer to be assured that they would be charged the correct level of tax. The original bill meant there was some ability to protect working holiday-makers from that type of exploitation. We oppose this bill in its current form because it removes this further level of protection for these vulnerable workers where there have been very serious cases of exploitation and ill-treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2016 the finance minister, Senator Cormann, defended making the register public on the grounds that it would allow working holiday-makers to identify whether a prospective employer was registered. Don't forget that; that's what Senator Cormann, part of the federal government, said. However, he has now apparently changed his opinion. He has agreed to remove the safeguard for workers in exchange for Senator Leyonhjelm's support. Senator Leyonhjelm said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time in Australia's history, it—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the register—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">will authorise the Australian Taxation Office to divulge the private financial details of employers to the Fair Work Ombudsman so it can enforce government decrees on wages, including minimum wages, award wages and penalty rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was reported that Senator Leyonhjelm had successfully lobbied the government to make the register private. There were also totally unsupported and scurrilous assertions that unions could misuse the bill's provisions to scare employers away from hiring foreign labour and that unions opposed to the use of foreign labour might visit registered companies to scare them off from hiring backpackers. This is just par for the course for those opposite. Union bashing seems to be the government's method of argument whenever they are unable to explain why they are abolishing good policy such as this register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer's second reading speech was strangely silent on this issue. He said that the bill introduced changes to ensure that details of the working holiday-maker employer register are not made public. He did not say why these changes were thought to be necessary. The fact is that removing public access to the register removes an important safeguard that ensures that working holiday-makers are not exploited. Similarly, the explanatory memorandum sheds no light on the reasons for the amendment, stating only that the bill gives effect to the government's commitments. Commitments to whom is not explained—commitments to Senator Leyonhjelm, no doubt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are at another point in the sorry saga of the backpacker tax, a totally botched policy which has damaged Australia as a backpacker destination. As we've heard from those opposite, backpackers are an important source of seasonal labour, and they've met many of these backpackers. They contribute significantly to our economy, and they bring cultural and social exchanges of benefit to our country and to their home countries. Many former backpackers now established back at home have fond memories of their time in Australia. They retain much goodwill towards Australia and sell Australia to their friends and family. But a lot of damage was done with this ill-thought-out plan, which was led by Nationals MPs. I would have thought they would have had a clearer understanding and appreciation of the importance of backpackers and working holiday-makers to their sectors and their regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Backpackers are incredibly important for the Northern Territory economy and seasonal employment requirements in agriculture, horticulture and hospitality. They also tend to stay longer than other tourists and inject a significant amount of the money they earn—in fact, much of their earnings—back into our local economies. But, as I said, many of them have stopped coming. Unfortunately, those opposite have done a very effective job in persuading them not to come here to Australia and, more specifically, to Darwin and the Top End. The perception now is that in Australia backpackers are highly taxed and countries like Canada and New Zealand are much more attractive. Added to that is the higher cost of visas for working holiday makers compared to other backpacker destinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Darwin and the Top End the tourism and hospitality industry is very seasonal. The peak, the dry season, has just started; it runs from May to October. So we are now looking to tourism to take up some of the slack in the Darwin economy resulting from the winding down of the construction phase of the INPEX project. The tourism industry is becoming more and more important in the Top End. Now that the dry season is here, the industry is very stretched. There is, in fact, a labour shortage. I have been talking to tourism and hospitality industry leaders in Darwin and they tell me that backpacker numbers, working holiday maker numbers, are well down on previous years. Unfortunately, they are pessimistic about numbers as we go forward into this dry season.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage, in Mitchell Street, Darwin's main tourism and backpacker precinct—and I'm sure many in the chamber have visited Mitchell Street—there are approximately 1,000 backpacker beds in the hostels. Despite there being lots of work available for backpackers in labouring and hospitality, operators are struggling to attract them to Darwin. At present, the backpacker hostels are running at about 60 per cent capacity. They should be at 85 per cent capacity now that the dry season has started. A month ago not one of these backpacker hostels had even opened, because of lack of demand. Usually, a month ago, or six weeks ago, on that shoulder season coming into the dry, they would already be at 50 per cent. So there's clearly been a direct hit to the Darwin economy. The three major hostels in Mitchell Street have projected a downturn of $1 million to $1.5 million over the coming year. That's what they had projected previously, after the backpacker tax was introduced. But in May, in the first week of the dry season, they are already down $1 million in revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is more important is that a knock-on effect goes down through the economy; the lower number of backpackers goes down through our economy. Now, $1 million in revenue may not seem like a lot to some of those opposite. In fact, for people who live in harbourside mansions, it's not even what they pay out of their own pocket to win an election. But, to us, in the Top End, in our northern capital, in our tourism industry, it's a big hit. Each backpacker bed is worth 27 bucks a night. So we're losing a lot of that revenue. In addition to that direct cost, each backpacker spends an average of $250 per week in supermarkets, retail and entertainment. They spend that 250 bucks out of their own earnings. Those earnings go straight back into the local economy. One estimate is that if, as feared, backpacker numbers are down over this coming dry season, then something like $8 million will be taken out of businesses in Mitchell Street and the Darwin CBD. Thanks a lot to those who engineered the backpacker tax and absolutely botched its implementation!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, this is going to have a big impact on our tourism economy. Tourism is vital to the Territory. That's why I'm so concerned about the ongoing impact of our attractiveness as a destination for backpackers, which would only have been enhanced by having a register where employees could check the bona fides of these employers. You may ask: 'What are you doing about it, member for Solomon?' I'll tell you what I'm doing about it. Boosting tourism in Darwin is incredibly important, particularly after the botched backpacker tax scaring tourists away. So recently, on 28 April at the Darwin International Airport, we ran a Tourism IdeasFest so that we could come up with new tourism products to try to attract some of these young people back from all around the world. I want to acknowledge all the organisers and sponsors of that event. I worked with local innovators and entrepreneurs. Local businesspeople were really worried about the impact of this drop in backpacker numbers, and we put on a one-day event at the Wirraway lounge at the airport. I thank all the sponsors and those that contributed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some great ideas were pitched at the end of the event, and we're going to work with those people to try to bring those working holiday-makers back. The Northern Territory government are also doing their bit. They've recently announced a $103 million tourism stimulus package to attract more visitors, to create more local jobs and to put more money into the pockets of Territorians. They're rolling that Turbocharging Tourism program out at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want those opposite to understand in the time remaining is that Darwin, as the capital of the north, is of strategic significance to our country. It is a strategic hub. We provide a massive return on investment to our country, and we need you to stop cutting our services. GST has been cut, hospital and school funding has been cut, and the City Deal hasn't been signed. It is not helpful, in the same way the backpacker tax changes weren't helpful. We need you to start supporting our industries, and that is one of the reasons why I oppose this bill.</span>

                    </a>  I'll do my best, Member for Mackellar. What is it about this government and deals around transparency laws? We saw a couple of years ago the government do a deal with the Greens political party to water down tax transparency for large private firms, raising the threshold so it took two-thirds of those private companies outside the tax transparency net. Then, in this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017, we're seeing a dodgy backroom deal with Senator Leyonhjelm to remove the ability of the Commissioner of Taxation to make information concerning the registration of employers of working holiday-makers publicly available. Strangely, the explanatory memorandum to the bill states that removing transparency was a government commitment, but that's not what the public record acknowledges. Comments made to Fairfax media on 13 December 2017 paint quite a different story. Let me quote that article:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A spokesman for the Treasurer Scott Morrison said the bill was proposed by Senator Leyonhjelm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The government agreed to introduce the amendment after reaching an agreement with the senator to pass the original WYHM legislation. The government will honour its commitment," the spokesman said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"This commitment did not extend to the successful passage of the amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's even more bemusing than the suggestion that the commitment didn't extend to the passing of the legislation is the following quote from the Treasurer's spokesman:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The government is committed to protecting the rights of backpackers and protecting them from exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That strains credulity. As the Treasurer would be aware, under the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Bill 2016—the bill that passed parliament—employers of working holiday-makers were required to register with the tax office. Those employers were required to have proof and date of registration attached to their Australian Business Register records to enable backpackers to confirm both a potential employer's registration and the rate at which they could expect to be taxed. The Treasurer issued a media release stating backpackers could look up employers by ABN Lookup, making the register publicly available. Here is the full quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To generate more accurate data and boost integrity of the scheme by preventing exploitation of working holiday makers, their employers will be required to undertake a once-off registration with the Australian Taxation Office [ATO]. This simple and easy registration process will help provide valuable data on the employment of working holiday makers. Employers who do not register will be required to withhold tax at the 32.5 per cent rate. Working holiday makers will be made aware of registered employers via the publication of a list on the <span style="font-style:italic;">ABN Lookup</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would look in vain for the list that was promised via that media statement. It just isn't there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I and my Labor colleagues believe in transparency. That is evident in our approach to tax transparency in other spheres. But it is absolutely vital in this sphere, and that's because we've had a number of reports providing really concerning evidence about the exploitation of working holiday-makers. These are young people coming to Australia often for the first time. We have a societal responsibility to make sure that they're not ripped off. It's the decent thing to do, but, beyond that, the rip-offs of working holiday-makers undercut labour standards for local workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They create a situation in which those working holiday-makers who will go on and do terrific things in their home countries might develop a pretty sour sense of what Australia stands for. The last thing we want is for the future leaders of countries like Britain, Canada, Germany, Sweden or Korea to go back to their countries telling the story to their friends that Australia was the country where they got ripped off by a dodgy employer. Those dodgy employers are in the minority, thankfully, but we don't want working holiday-makers to be ripped off. Even worse than the wage rip-offs is the sexual exploitation which has happened in the past, of which cases have been documented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's particularly a concern because of the way in which we structure visas, in that obtaining that second-year visa is contingent on doing work in a rural or regional area. That means that some working holiday-makers are placed in a situation in which they're reluctant to report abuse because they know, if the employer doesn't sign off on their having worked in that area, they won't get that second-year visa. That creates a bargaining imbalance that doesn't exist for most workers. So it's just critical that we crack down on exploitation and the promised ABN Look-up was one useful way of doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of Labor's commitment to transparency, I wrote to the Treasurer about this bill. I requested the government remove the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. It had, after all, languished on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for some time. I urged the government to publicly indicate their support for transparency in the Working Holiday Maker scheme and have the Commissioner for Taxation make the information publicly available. Such a public commitment by the government would have removed uncertainty about the future status of the register bill. It would have ensured that information vital to the integrity of our tax system and, critically, that prevents the exploitation of workers was no longer available. No-one on either side of this House wants working holiday-makers to be exploited. But the government has brought on this bill for debate, and those of us on this side of the House are asking: what backroom deal does this relate to? Is this an attempt to have Senator Leyonhjelm rush through the remainder of the government's $80 billion tax cut for the top end of town? Is it an attempt to secure speedy passage of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan Base Rate Entities) Bill 2018—the government's patch-up job of its rushed first round of company tax cuts? We won't know because the government's reasons are as opaque as the register itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions and tax justice organisations have called for the tax commissioner to make public that register, as the Treasurer's media release signalled will be done. But this bill ties the hands of the tax commissioner. This bill means the tax commissioner isn't able to fulfil the intentions of the Treasurer as stated in that media release. It's not the first time the government has stymied the Australian Taxation Office. We know, of course, of the 4,000 jobs that have been cut. But it is something that I urge the government to rethink. No-one should support exploitation. We have a measure that can reduce exploitation by providing those working holiday-makers with the look-up of employers that they were promised. I and my Labor colleagues will do our best to work with the crossbench in defeating this bill—another part of the government's war on transparency and a measure which, if passed, would worsen the exploitation of an already vulnerable group of workers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  At the end of 2016, the government was faced with the prospect that working holiday-makers, better known as backpackers, were going to find other destinations more desirable than Australia because changes to our tax law meant that they would be paying significantly higher taxes here than they would in other countries. I will resist the temptation to make the point that high tax rates have adverse implications for our economy and that any party thinking of levying over $200 billion in taxes on hardworking Australians and Australian businesses would be arguing for some very adverse implications for our economy—some would even argue catastrophic implications. Indeed, I will also resist the temptation to point out that those opposite have constantly opposed reducing taxes for ordinary Australians and the Australian businesses that provide work, investment and products to those same hardworking Australians. But, a year ago we found a group of people that they thought did deserve a tax cut. It's a shame they were not Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government suggested a 19 per cent tax rate for foreign backpackers, those opposite were outraged that it was not lower. So imagine my surprise when the member for Fenner said that backpackers can, and in fact do, reduce conditions and wages. But still he and his party argued for further reducing the tax burden on this group to 15 per cent. Perhaps he secretly knows that these claims of exploitation are exaggerated. Despite this, I was glad that this parliament could at last come together around meaningful tax cuts. It was just a shame that it was for people who do not live here. It was like opposite day: the Labor Party were arguing for tax cuts and we were arguing for responsible taxation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The implications of the increase in taxes were well noted by many at the time. The most vocal of those were the many farmers and growers of this great country. They pointed out that backpackers were now bypassing this nation and taking their labour to other countries, such as New Zealand. They preferred to work in New Zealand rather than Australia—that's how serious things had got. It meant reduced production, fruit dying on trees, jobs left undone and farmers scaling back their operations for want of people to do the work. They were not alone. Many tourist destinations said they would be adversely impacted by backpackers not coming to Australia. Many hospitality businesses said they could no longer fill roles in their businesses. In my electorate of Mackellar, on the Northern Beaches, many of the cafes and restaurants that people who come to our area rely on were finding that they could not find people to work and, therefore, had to close, denying people the food and coffee of the fine area of the Northern Beaches. Basically, this tax increase, in an area where people could pick and choose, was reducing our capacity as a country to provide jobs, work and income for many hardworking Australians and their families. So, there we were. High taxes were causing economic damage. The Liberal Party struck a deal with the Greens—the Greens!—to reduce taxes because even the Greens could see that it was a good idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 introduces changes to ensure that details of the working holiday-maker employer register are not made public. It also ensures that information sharing between the Australian Taxation Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman is undertaken in situations in which an entity is actually or is reasonably suspected of noncompliance with tax law. Though minor amendments to taxation law, this bill removes the ability for details of employer registers to be made public on the ABN Lookup. This change will not affect the operation of the employer register or the rules applying to employers of working holiday-makers. All employers of working holiday-makers will still be required to register with the ATO in order to withhold the 15 per cent tax rate. The register addresses concerns about the exploitation of working holiday-makers and will provide valuable data on working holiday-makers. This amendment being introduced today does not affect the requirement for the ATO to report this information annually to the Treasurer for presentation to the parliament. This reporting process involves aggregate employer information and will not identify any working-holiday-maker employers. This bill also ensures that information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman will be limited to situations in which an entity is guilty of, or is reasonably suspected of, noncompliance with the tax law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at the heart of this bill is the underlying principle that our data belongs to us. We live in a world where too many organisations, be they private companies or public entities, believe that they own our data. If we are nothing more, surely we are the sum total of what we have done, said and thought. This information can be used to carefully understand us in order to help and assist us and to ensure that we are not violating our laws and our mutual obligations to each other. Where all of this goes awry is when private companies such as Cambridge Analytica use it to manipulate us and to ensure we do things that are not in our best interests, through carefully crafted, targeted and highly curated information—information that plays to our worst fears, evokes passions and encourages us to ignore reason. This is the danger that we face in the 21st century. We do not want governments or any other entities believing that we and our information belong to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of the measures contained in this bill is that they strike a careful balance between what government needs and what we owe—and, more importantly, what we own. Our information belongs to us. Therefore, restricting access and not allowing all the information contained in the ABN register to be publicly available is an important step in attaining this goal. To give teeth to this provision, the TAA Act creates an offence for the disclosure of protected information by taxation officers. To further tighten disclosure protocols in order to ensure that the register is used only for proper purposes, and to give effect to the principle that our information belongs to us, not to government agencies, disclosure could only occur in circumstances where the record or disclosure was of the fact of an entity's actual or reasonably suspected noncompliance with taxation law and was for the purposes of ensuring the entity's compliance with the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this bill ensures that employers are registered with the ATO so that the government can ensure the integrity of the tax system—nothing more and nothing less. It does this by implementing a registration framework for the employers of backpackers; providing the administrative arrangements for tax to be withheld at the appropriate rate for these taxpayers; requiring the Commissioner of Taxation to report annually on the operation of the tax arrangements; and allowing the commissioner to provide relevant information to the Fair Work Ombudsman. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

As has been spoken about, the government recognises that working holiday-makers are an integral part of Australia's tourism industry and also a key source of labour, particularly in the agriculture, horticulture, tourism and hospitality sectors. This bill, importantly, removes the ability for details of the register of employers of working holiday-makers to be made public by the Australian Business Register via ABN Lookup. Importantly, all employers of working holiday-makers will still be required to register with the Australian Taxation Office. Registered employers will be able to withhold tax at the new working-holiday-maker rate of 15 per cent, from the first dollar of income up to $37,000. Once registered, employers can advise current and prospective working holiday-makers that they're registered and are able to withhold tax at the new working-holiday-maker rate of 15 per cent, from the first dollar of income up to $37,000, as I mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The register addresses concerns about the exploitation of working holiday-makers and will provide valuable data on who employs working holiday-makers, what sectors they are engaged in and, importantly, where they are located. This amendment does not affect the requirement for the Australian Taxation Office to report this information annually to the Treasurer, ultimately for presentation to the parliament. This reporting process involves aggregate employer information and won't identify any working holiday-maker employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, this bill restores provisions regarding information-sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman to what they were prior to the changes made by the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016. Information-sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman will be limited to situations in which an entity is actually or reasonably suspected of noncompliance with the respective tax law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, again, is part of a broader package of reforms to ensure that Australia remains an attractive and safe destination for working holiday-makers in all of those very important sectors of our economy that I mentioned earlier. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I commend the minister for his second reading speech and its content and brevity, and I'll do my utmost to match that in a bipartisan way. Labor supports the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017. The aim of the bill before the House is to improve the governance, transparency and accountability of the National Capital Authority. The amendments in the bill give the NCA board responsibility for, and power to, govern this important agency. At present, the NCA's chief executive and not the authority is the accountable authority under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act. This arrangement does not provide decision-making within the NCA with sufficient oversight and transparency, nor does it provide the requisite support to the minister. Establishing the authority as the accountable authority and enabling it to give specific directions to the chief executive will allow it to become involved in NCA operations and clarify the current authority-chief executive relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for related amendments that support the authority in satisfying its responsibilities as the accountable authority and update the planning and land management act to make it consistent with established policy on public sector governance. This includes making all authority members officials of the NCA so as to engage the PGPA Act provisions concerning the duty of officials—notably care and diligence. There are related amendments to clarify the minister's existing powers by obliging the authority to comply with ministerial directions other than where this conflicts with its performance of powers under the PGPA Act, and by specifying that such amendments are legislative instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was curious to investigate the provenance of this particular amendment, because I am concerned that an authority such as the National Capital Authority is free to carry out its important task in a way that is based on the expert, impartial and enthusiastic advice of the authority members and the members of the staff of the authority. I was concerned that this instrument, or this particular amendment, may, in some way, interfere with the capacity of the authority to fulfil those functions. I thought the best place to go to ensure that this bill would not have any unintended consequences was to a key stakeholder in the National Capital Authority, the ACT government, who have a keen interest in ensuring that they work hand in hand with the National Capital Authority. I ensured that my office consulted with the Chief Minister's office to ensure that they had full vision and full support of the amendments before this legislature. I'm reliably informed that they have, and that they support the key amendments that are subject to this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes amendments to clearly delineate the different responsibilities of the authority as the accountable authority under the PGPA Act—and the chief executive as the head of the statutory agencies for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1999. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has direct responsibility for locations and functions that reflect Canberra as the national capital. The Australian Constitution provides that the seat of government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the parliament, and shall be within territory, which shall have been granted to, or acquired by, the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belonging to the Commonwealth. Under the constitutional provision, the Commonwealth remains the owner of the land in the Territory even after granting self-government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a matter of history that Australia's national capital officially came into being in January 1911, when title to 111 square miles of land in the district of Yass, Canberra, was passed to the Commonwealth by the state of New South Wales. The Seat of Government Acceptance Act of 1909 provided that the territory would be acquired by the Commonwealth for the seat of government and that it would be known as the Federal Capital Territory. As outlined on the National Capital Authority website:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Canberra's function as the Seat of Government and as the nation's capital have been the basis for the establishment of Australia's principal governmental, judicial, cultural, scientific, educational, and military institutions. It has resulted in foreign governments establishing diplomatic missions and residences, and in an increasing number of national organisations and institutions seeking a presence in the capital. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The gradual accumulation of important national functions has been accompanied by a growing awareness of Canberra's significance in Australia's national and international life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any visitor to our national capital during the festival of Floriade will testify to these facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The role that the National Capital Authority plays in Canberra is incredibly important. It was established by the Commonwealth to reflect the Commonwealth's interests and to carry out its intentions, consistent with the original design of the national capital. Its role is to ensure that planning decisions maintain the national significance of Canberra's streets and precincts, while ensuring that residents enjoy all of the amenities of a livable city. The National Capital Authority has the task of designing and caring for our National Capital Estate, a vital Commonwealth asset and an internationally significant precinct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NCA also prepares, administers and reviews the National Capital Plan and proposes amendments as necessary. The National Capital Plan is, in effect, the blueprint that gives effect to the Commonwealth's interests within the borders of the Australian Capital Territory. It ensures that Canberra and the territory are planned and developed in accordance with their national significance. More specifically, the purpose of the National Capital Plan is to ensure that the Commonwealth's national capital interests in the territory are fully protected without otherwise involving the Commonwealth in matters that should be the prerogative of the Canberra community. This is a delicate balance. The National Capital Authority is a statutory authority established when the ACT was granted self-government in 1988 to manage the interests of the Commonwealth in Canberra, especially the planning and management of major Commonwealth assets in nationally important areas. These assets are a broad collection of public open spaces, lakes, dams, memorials, infrastructure and buildings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to put on the public record that nothing within the amendments that are before the parliament today is intended to derogate from the important delegation of power from the Commonwealth to the ACT Legislative Assembly to manage the affairs of the Australian Capital Territory when it comes to the delivery of territory based services and the management of the municipal functions of this wonderful city. An example of that is the Canberra Light Rail project, which is on foot at the moment. As you would expect, the National Capital Authority works closely with the ACT government in relation to several of the key development projects, including this important light rail infrastructure project and the City to the Lake development.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of the light rail project, we welcome the 2012 decision by the ACT Labor government to build the light rail network for Canberra. We think it is a national-capital-building project which will be enjoyed by not just the residents of this fine city but all of those who come here to visit. Light rail stage 1 is well under construction, and the 12-kilometre route is expected to be operating in the later part of this year. Light rail stage 2 is another 12-kilometre corridor from Canberra City to Woden through the Parliamentary Triangle. This will require consultation with the National Capital Authority. I am confident that the good graces of this parliament, its ministerial representative, the National Capital Authority, the Legislative Assembly and its executive officers will ensure that this important project will be seen through for the benefit of not just the residents of the Australian Capital Territory but all Australians who come and visit this wonderful city. The minister said in his second reading speech that this is a non-controversial piece of legislation—and it is. Labor supports it, but we do so in the understanding that the grant of legislative authority to the ACT government was a genuine one and this parliament should not unnecessarily interfere in the ordinary affairs of that legislature.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249908" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Tonight I rise on behalf of the people of Herbert to clearly articulate their anger and feelings of absolute disbelief after last night's budget. Anger and disappointment don't even come near to how the people of Herbert are feeling about this completely out of touch Turnbull government. There wasn't one thing in the budget for Townsville—just cuts. The people of Herbert were very clear about their list of demands prior to the budget, and now the government will feel their wrath for not delivering. There was not one cent in the budget for long-term water security infrastructure for Townsville. There was not one cent in the budget for vital energy infrastructure. There was not one cent for Townsville's port expansion project, a development that will deliver a $580 million return on investment to the local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville's priorities are very clear: jobs and infrastructure. Unemployment in Townsville has almost doubled under the Abbott and Turnbull governments. The Turnbull government's failure to deliver vital infrastructure projects means a huge failure in delivering jobs for Townsville. Here's a news flash for the Turnbull government: if you don't have a job, you don't get a tax cut! What sort of relief is a tax cut for people who have been without a job for more than two years because they lost their job at QNI? What sort of relief is a tax cut for people who lost their job under Campbell Newman? It provides zero relief, because they need a job before they can get a tax cut. A person on $37,000 will get a $3.76 tax reduction. That won't even buy a jar of Vegemite. This government is completely out of touch with working families, because there are certainly no 'happy little vegemites' in Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not satisfied with not delivering infrastructure, this government is making savage cuts to our community as well. It has cut around $14.8 million from Townsville schools, $36 million from James Cook University and $38 million from Central Queensland University. It has cut $1.5 billion from the National Partnership on Remote Housing, which means the loss of seven jobs on Palm Island. It has cut $40.7 million from allied and dental health services and frozen the Repatriation Medical Fee Schedule, which has already seen a reduction in access to vital medical services for our veterans. These cuts will mean further job losses in Herbert.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there is the absolute fizzer of decentralisation, with only a few jobs being moved. This includes establishing the Office of the National Rural Health Commissioner in the very 'regional' area of Adelaide. I wanted to see the 110 ATO jobs cut under this government restored in Townsville, the 40th Royal Australian Air Force 36 Squadron King Air fleet reinstated, the 19 CSIRO jobs restored, the 50 Defence staff jobs restored and the 30 regional Queensland Customs staff reinstated. Instead the government slashed another 1,280 public sector jobs. Shame on the Turnbull government!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And after the Treasurer announced this do-nothing budget for Townsville, his out of touch colleagues clapped him and slapped him on the back: 'Great job! Well done!' I say to the people of Herbert that it appears the Turnbull government is proud of not delivering long-term water security infrastructure or vital energy infrastructure or the port expansion project. And the Turnbull government appears to also be proud, cheerful and merry about the cuts to schools, health, universities and veterans. This government should feel ashamed. But no, the LNP is very proud to be giving an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor will deliver for regional, rural and remote Queensland. Only Labor delivers on jobs, education, health, pensioners and veterans. I fought for Labor's $200 million commitment for hydro power on the Burdekin Falls Dam. I fought for Labor's $100 million commitment for long-term water security. I fought for Labor's $75 million commitment for the port expansion. And I fought for our veterans and Labor's commitment to $121 million for a transitioning employment program. A Labor budget would have delivered for the people of Townsville. Shame on the Turnbull government once again for your do-nothing budget for the people of Herbert!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AMM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HARTSUYKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  It is our great privilege in this place to represent a broad cross-section of people in our community. The voice of youth is often not heard as clearly as it should be. I invited student leaders from local schools to a youth forum hosted by St Columba Anglican School in Port Macquarie on Wednesday, 11 April. At the outset, I want to place on the record my thanks to St Columba Anglican School for agreeing to host the forum. In particular, I'd like to thank Principal Terry Muldoon, Peta Watters and Julie Cooper for all of the hard work they put in, preparing the venue, organising catering and ensuring the forum ran smoothly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank those student leaders who took time out from their study to attend the forum to discuss issues that are important to them and their peers. These students were: from St Columba Anglican School, Harry Webb, Luke Green, Brandon Green and Jordan Magnus-McCarthy; from Hastings Secondary College, Blake Elliot and Tiegan Munro; from Melville High School, Emma Davidson and Wilisoni Tavua; from the Kempsey Adventist School, Nate Curtis and Olivia Jeffrey; from Heritage Christian School, Caleb Campion; from MacKillop College, Thomas Berryman and Harry Hiatt; from Newman Senior Technical College, Jamie-Lee Smith and Sarah Woodbury; from St Joseph's Regional College, Lucy Westcott and Bradley Batty; and from St Paul's College, Harley Thackray, Eloise MacDonald and Mariah Allen. The students were all very enthusiastic and weren't shy in raising what's important to them as young people, and I want to share with the House what these student leaders think are the most significant issues facing their peers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unsurprising that issues relating to education are at the top of their list. Students raised the pressure they felt to perform in standardised testing, the NAPLAN and their final HSC exams. They also raised the pressure they felt from peers and parents to attend university rather than pursue a trade career. There was a keen appreciation of the importance of vocational education and the value of the vocational education pathway. Whilst acknowledging the presence of universities on the Mid North Coast, the students raised the fact that many North Coast students had to study away due to the limitations of course offerings available. The students also raised the high cost of obtaining a tertiary education when moving to a metropolitan uni was required. The forum also expressed its support for a gap year before starting university, and the value of getting relevant work experience during that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The students were incredibly passionate about the environment. Wilisoni and Emma from Melville High School raised their desire to build up a comprehensive recycling program at their school, citing the large volume of paper used as part of their education. The challenges of recycling have certainly been in the news since the forum was held.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Students also raised Australia's energy mix, the debate about coal-fired power versus renewables, and the importance of compliance with the Paris Agreement. The students were concerned about the sustainability of the Great Barrier Reef. I would note the coalition government's recently announced $500 million package to protect the reef and secure its viability and the 64,000 jobs that rely on the reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those present also discussed Australia's geopolitical environment, raising concerns about the need to balance tensions in our region while maintaining our trade relationships with the United States and China. There was also concern in the room about the requirement in New South Wales for 120 driver experience hours, and the burden that placed on young drivers and their families. There was concern also about the need for more financial support with regard to challenges faced by regional athletes in order to compete at elite competitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend the student leaders for what was an informed and free-flowing discussion. The issues important to young people are very diverse, and it has been my honour to raise them in the House this evening.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, the Liberal Party, under Tony Abbott, scrapped the Minister for Youth Affairs, but we should not let that decision silence the voice of youth—particularly, for me, the voices of the amazing young people in the Parramatta electorate. Launching Youth Week in April, I made a commitment to deliver at least one speech in parliament written by a young person every sitting week for two months. It is here that I will share their concerns, their requests and their challenges to us in parliament, the body responsible for shaping the Australia of tomorrow—their Australia. Already, many young people in my electorate have submitted speeches and I'm inspired and challenged by their resilience, strength and commitment to making the world a better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands, young people are understandably disillusioned with the Australian government. Youth unemployment is at the highest it's been in four decades and mental illness is on the rise, with 51 per cent of high school students identifying a need to see a mental health professional. Young people are met with an uncertain job market and shrinking educational opportunities, and the likelihood of buying a house feels like a dream. Unfortunately in this country, young people are often seen as a cost rather than the asset that they are. The reality is that the next three generations are going to carry the entire country and its economy into the next century, and we here, for the most part, won't be alive to see them do it. Only 11 per cent of us in parliament are under the age of 40.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The voice of youth has incredible power. We are seeing its full effect in the US. Children are taking to the streets, confronting the NRA and chastening politicians to change the gun laws and save the young lives that their government has long ignored. We saw it in Australia during the same-sex plebiscite, when 65,000 18-to-24-year-olds enrolled to vote, demonstrating the power of young people when engaged in political matters. We have seen it in full force in social enterprise. The Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience was founded by a 19-year-old in 2005 and it now operates out of Australia, South Africa and Uganda, boasting over 25,000 graduates. Hireup, an organisation that gives people with disabilities the power to find, hire and manage their own home care and support workers, was founded by a 23-year-old in 2011 and has made over 4,700 connections Australia-wide, saving users over $3 million. In my own electorate, I saw Usman Iftikhar found Catalysr when he was just 25. It is a start-up incubator for migrants and refugees in Australia and, since its launch in 2016, it's helped 66 migrant and refugee entrepreneurs to create 15 businesses. Usman is the Australian lead at the G20 Young Entrepreneurs' Alliance, which is currently designing a G20-wide youth entrepreneurship visa and is working on a new SpaceTech start-up at Singularity University to tackle climate change. Usman was named the Commonwealth Young Person of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our young people are contributing to our society, yet their influence and potential is recognised on global stages but not in the policy-shaping stage at home. Data mined from the Parramatta electorate shows that only 33 per cent of young people believe their opinions are accurately reflected in government policy, but 83 per cent are interested in learning more about how the government makes decisions. The reality is that young people are interested, but we, as Australia's leaders, are not providing adequate space for them to engage in the decision-making processes of government. So it's not surprising that they're a wee bit disengaged and jaded. They want to be involved, they care about the issues shaping their future, but, quite frankly, they don't always think that we in this parliament are worth their effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bringing local youth voices into parliament is not the total solution, but it is a step. The United Arab Emirates have a minister for youth, 23-year-old, Shamma bint Suhail Faris Al Mazrui, who leads their youth national council, and Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, appointed himself Minister for Youth in 2015. We can do much more in this House. The reality is that young people are clutching the pen that writes history. If we care about them and our future generations, we must hear them, support them and enable them to be stronger and more effective change-makers. Young people are going to be the ones grappling with the after-effects of environmental degradation, outdated institutions and infrastructure, not us. We have a government that doesn't always believe the future leaders are presently worth listening to or worth empowering to build a strong future, and for that we should all be deeply ashamed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to sharing with you the voices of passionate young people in Parramatta. And I thank the very young Ruby for helping me write this speech.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="74046" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOODENOUGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Self-funded retirees make a significant contribution to our nation and its finances. However, their interests are often overlooked by government, and they often become the targets for revenue raising to prop up budgets. In contributing to the adjournment debate, I wish to advocate for the interests of fully and partly self-funded retirees living in my electorate, who have made prudent choices to provide for their financial security in retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to thank Mr Ron de Gruchy OAM, representing the WA Self Funded Retirees Inc. and the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers' Association (WA) Inc., who met with me earlier this year to discuss the 2018-19 prebudget submission in detail. The first recommendation in the submission is that all Commonwealth superannuation pensions be indexed consistently, using the same formula as is used to adjust the Centrelink age pension. This problem of inequality of the method of indexation of the CSS and PSS pensions as compared to the method used for the indexation of the Centrelink age pension has been in existence for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A second recommendation is that the Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net thresholds for single retirees be restructured so that access to them becomes available at 65 per cent of the levels applicable to couples and families. Currently, a single retiree needs to spend the same amount on pharmaceutical prescriptions before reaching the safety net threshold as does a couple. A similar situation exists for the Medicare safety net. There is obvious discrimination, in that one person needs to incur the same total expenditure as does a couple before any concessional treatment is allowed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A third recommendation is that retirees be enabled to transfer funds into superannuation at the prescribed contribution levels without having to meet any work test. Retirees aged between 65 and 74 who wish to contribute funds to a superannuation fund are required to pass a work test before they are permitted to do so. In order to qualify, this test requires them to be gainfully employed for a minimum of 40 hours in any consecutive 30-day period throughout the relevant tax year. This test is considered to be an outdated, arbitrary hurdle with negligible practical value.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A fourth recommendation is that retirees be enabled to transfer funds into superannuation at the prescribed contribution levels irrespective of their age. Those people over the age of 75 and still in the workforce are now eligible to have the superannuation guarantee levy, currently 9½ per cent of their salary, paid into a recognised superannuation fund of their choice. However, anyone not employed is prohibited from contributing any funds into a superannuation fund if they're over the age of 75.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A fifth recommendation is that the deeming rates be reduced to one per cent up to the current levels of $50,200 and $83,400, with two per cent for the remainder. Deeming rates commenced in July 1996 and have been adjusted to accommodate changes. They were last changed in March 2015. Since then, there have been at least three reductions in the Reserve Bank cash rate but no changes in the official deeming rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sixth recommendation is that consideration be given to widening the scope of the National Disability Insurance Scheme or DisabilityCare Australia parameters so as to include all Australian citizens, including those aged over 65.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The seventh recommendation is that the interest rate of 5.73 per cent currently being charged for the nonpayment of a refundable accommodation deposit be reviewed with the intention of bringing it more into line with either the Reserve Bank's cash rate at 1.5 per cent or the consumer price index.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the 2018-19 prebudget submission by the WA Self Funded Retirees and the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers' Association (WA) to the House. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  The coalition are not far off finishing their fifth year in government, and we have seen them deliver their fifth budget. Strip away the fluff and the blowhard noises and we find yet another attempt by the coalition to trick Australians into believing that the Turnbull government cares about anyone other than the top end of town. I have some bad news for you, Treasurer Morrison and Prime Minister Turnbull: I have worked you out, the Labor Party has worked you out, and I think the people of Australia have worked you out. We remember your debt and deficit disaster, yet the government's fiscal strategy unveiled in 2014 is failing completely. We see federal government debt has surged from $310 billion in 2014 to $534 billion this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So while the Turnbull government pretend to be competent economic managers, we are onto you. Under this mob, we've seen a worsening of the budget's position, and it's all built on a foundation of unfairness. I have a lesson for the government: fairness isn't just a rhetorical device you get to dish out when it suits you politically; it's actually a set of values—a belief that informs every decision you make. Australians know that this out-of-touch government doesn't care about fairness for working Australians and their families, for jobseekers, for pensioners or for students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we heard all the hoopla and rhetoric from the Treasurer, I sat down and wrote a speech about what I knew the government would forget to put in Tuesday night's budget. I sealed it, and I have brought it with me tonight. I will now unseal the envelope and see how I went.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, the Turnbull government missed the chance to restore the $17 billion cut from Australian schools. 'Is that correct?' I ask the member for Blair. Yes, of course it is. Here's the bottom line: it's simple; Labor will restore every cent. Of this funding we'll restore, nearly 90 per cent will go to public schools, the schools that are doing most of the heavy lifting. In my electorate of Moreton, $15 million has been ripped from public schools, and this budget will not restore it. Shame! These cuts will mean fewer teachers and support staff, less one-on-one attention for children and less help with the basics like reading, writing and maths. The Turnbull government are economic vandals masquerading as economists. They want to talk about how the economy works for big business, but how does our economy work for everyone if our kids can't get a decent education? It's short-sighted and ignores the productivity gains that flow from investing in education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder how health went. In this budget, the Turnbull government have missed the opportunity to ensure health care remains affordable for all Australians—check. They're continuing to put at risk our universal healthcare system. Alongside GPs, Australia's public hospitals are the workhorses of our health system. In my electorate of Moreton we have the QEII hospital and, sitting over the border, the Princess Alexandra Hospital. On Tuesday night, the Treasurer failed to restore the $160 million the government have ripped from Queensland's hospitals, including from the QEII and the PAH. The cut is the equivalent of 240,000 emergency department visits, 44,000 cataract extractions, 6,150 knee replacements or 26,500 births. The omission from the budget will affect every Queenslander and every Queensland family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget again failed to fund Cross River Rail—check—a critical piece of infrastructure for all who live in South East Queensland. The existing inner city rail crossing over the Brisbane River, the Merivale Bridge, is at full capacity; we all know that. The federal Labor Party committed $2.24 billion to partner with the Queensland Labor government to get this project done. On Tuesday night, the government failed to take up our offer of bipartisanship to deliver this critical congestion-busting public transport infrastructure that will serve Queenslanders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no mention of the Coopers Plains rail crossing. I recently wrote to Prime Minister Turnbull and urged him to find money in the budget to commit to a solution for the Coopers Plains level crossing mess. Last night, that fell on deaf ears, and the government missed another piece of critical infrastructure for southsiders. There are real safety concerns and major traffic congestion. This crossing is used by as many as 1,000 vehicles an hour in peak periods. In the absence of leadership from the Turnbull government, I will continue to work with the state government and the Brisbane City Council to get this dangerous mess sorted. Prime Minister, you are still welcome to join me. It is something that was highlighted by the former member for Moreton, Gary Hardgrave, in 1998.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how did I go? It's not hard to guess what's going to be in a budget from a government that is so committed to delivering for the top end of town and that has a track record of ignoring middle- and working-class Australians. Labor will continue to fight for as long as necessary to get working Australians, families, young people, jobseekers and pensioners a better deal and help create a fairer, more egalitarian Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  Last night's budget was a turning point for Canning. After years of lobbying, advocacy and community support, the coalition government committed $824 million of federal funding to build major road and rail projects in our region. This is going to have a positive impact on the lives of thousands of people. The largest of these three projects, over half a billion dollars worth of investment, will extend the Tonkin Highway south into the heart of the Peel region. Presently, the Tonkin Highway ends abruptly at Thomas Road. Commuter traffic and heavy transport spills out into the streets of Byford, posing a danger to pedestrians, cyclists, horseriders and drivers. We will extend the Tonkin Highway south through the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale and connect it with the South Western Highway south of Mundijong. It's going to make a lot of local roads much safer for people, reduce congestion and open up access to the centre of the Peel region for both commercial and industrial development. This will expand the opportunities for business owners and provide an easy and direct route to the airport for people in exports. Importantly, all of this investment is going to grow local jobs in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also secured funding that will extend the Armadale train line to Byford—and this is big news. The Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale has weathered serious change over the past 10 years. This train line and station will help ease population pressures by providing easy access to employment in Perth and beyond. For many, it will mean a shorter trip to work and less time on the road. For students and young people, the Byford train station will mean better access to education and other opportunities in the city. It will also draw together old Byford in the east and new Byford in the west, giving the town a heart and a centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we have commenced our journey to building a second train station in the City of Mandurah. This is seriously needed for WA's second-largest city. Now, the long-awaited Lakeland railway station is set to become a reality. We have $2 million for the required business case, and further funding has been set aside for the station's construction. Lakeland's residents have been waiting over a decade for this to happen. In that time, Lakeland's population has tripled. When this is done, people travelling to the city will get there in less than an hour instead of being stuck in traffic or struggling to find a park when they arrive at their destination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects aren't just fantasies or empty promises; they are happening and they are vital to the future of our region. This is going to draw investment to Peel because, where you build roads, where you build rail, people want to live, start a business and make a life. Government investment in infrastructure is known to have a multiplying effect on the local economy and so we are unlocking the potential of our region with this investment. A perfect example is Bells Engines. For 30 years, Ron Bell has built his engine reconditioning business from the ground up into a big operation with a global market. He is exporting all over the world and has enough demand to expand and take on at least 10 new staff, but the sprawl of Mandurah has meant there isn't enough space in the city for further expansion of Ron's business. Ron Bell wants to stay local, but this restraint has made it very difficult. The Tonkin Highway extension will activate land for a planned business park in West Mundijong, which is perfect for people like Ron, who want to stay local and invest in the Peel region. I also think of people like Mandy and Patrick Faulkner of Lakelands. They contacted me this week, thrilled to hear the train station is finally coming to their town. They shared just how much it will benefit them and their fellow residents, who will soon have easy access to Perth, all within walking distance of their front doors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night was an important moment for everyone in Canning. I commend the many local people who have helped us make this happen by attending town hall meetings—30 last year—filling out surveys, signing petitions and sharing their stories with me. We have delivered historic infrastructure investment into Canning, and I thank the federal government for showing leadership in this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I'm delighted to announce and acknowledge 10 local recipients of grants under the federal government's Stronger Communities Program. I want to pay tribute to the very important work that community groups in my electorate do in building, developing and fostering stronger communities. I'd like to begin with the Sydenham Park Soccer Club, which received $20,000 to install new lights and to open up an additional ground for junior training. Junior soccer is one of the most popular forms of sport for young people in my electorate. The Brimbank Bicycle Education Centre received $6,000 to improve playground facilities. They do a great job of facilitating bicycle education for young people. Another great soccer club in my electorate, the Upfield Soccer Club, received $17,352 for new fencing around the grounds to enhance player safety and ground maintenance. The Tullamarine Community House received $19,000 to fit out and furnish a new men's shed, which we're all very excited about. The Tullamarine Football Club received $3,586 for goalpost covers, again to increase player safety. The Jacana Junior Football Club received $20,000 for upgrading lights to cater for increased ground use and to save on energy costs. My favourite organisation, Brite Services, received $15,190 to help refurbish the entrance to the building in order to make it more accessible and welcoming. Chaldean Welfare of Victoria received $19,870 to purchase a new sound system to ensure greater inclusion for those using the centre, which they are building and are very proud of. The Australian Assyrian Arts and Literature Foundation received $9,000 to install shade sails for more outdoor communal activities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Banksia Gardens Community Services received $20,000 to fit out and furnish a new portable building, called Youthspace 3047, for the Broadmeadows Youth Justice Alliance. As part of the Stronger Communities grants, I was able to officially open Banksia Gardens Community Services' new building, Youthspace 3047, together with the state member for Broadmeadows, the Hon. Frank McGuire. This new building will offer a range of co-located services to vulnerable young people, including those who access the Northern Community Legal Centre, headspace, YSAS drug and alcohol counselling, FMC Mediation and Counselling, and Jesuit Social Services.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I'm thrilled to welcome more support for the Groom electorate from the federal budget released last night. Toowoomba and the Darling Downs are certainly setting the pace for regional Australia. We have a proven, strong local economy. We have the largest inland road project in Australia in the form of the Toowoomba second range crossing, currently under construction. We're progressing very well with plans for inland rail, Melbourne to Brisbane, and that will have a significant impact in my part of the world, on the Darling Downs. We continue to enjoy the benefits of the Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, which is internationally capable. We continue to see, through the budget in particular, major highway upgrades on the Warrego Highway, particularly west of Oakey. World-class agriculture remains the signature of our region. As a regional centre for southern inland Queensland and northern inland New South Wales, we continue to attract health and education experts and services for people right throughout the regions. We're focused on a burgeoning tourism industry. As an early rollout site for both NBN and NDIS, we have progressed a long way. But we know there is plenty more to do to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from opportunities in our part of the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly pleased to see my desire of studies proceeding towards passenger rail from Toowoomba to Brisbane, with a $15 million business case announced just last night as part of the budget, through the federal government's $250 million Major Project Business Case Fund. After decades of discussion and dreaming, we are taking this project from the drawing board through to delivery, and this will bring tremendous benefits to the whole region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Groom, I've been very humbled to receive the continuing support of my party members as the re-endorsed candidate for the next federal election. And I note the interesting commentary from minor parties, in particular, who seem to focus on single issues, are ill-informed about local issues in Groom and across the Darling Downs, and yet seem to forget their own experience to date. I use the example of the performance of minor parties in the recent South Australian state election: theirs was an unmitigated disaster. In contrast to that, my region knows that our government is focused on tax relief to reward working Australians. We want to support our communities, ensure the essential services are in place and ensure the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  The week before last, I held a forum for seniors in my electorate, in the beautiful memorial hall in Cockburn. Our guest was the shadow minister for families and social services, the honourable and the brilliant Jenny Macklin. People asked questions or gave us their perspective about a range of issues, including pensions, health care, home care packages, dividend imputation, climate change, the resources and client services at Centrelink, and aged care services in general. Of course, we talked about the forthcoming budget and the areas in which Australia needs leadership, direction, action and a sense of purpose. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality in Western Australia is we are still fighting our way through the end of a recession. The reality for people on fixed incomes, like pensions, is that non-discretionary costs like gas and electricity, health costs, and health insurance are continuing to rise and they are far outstripping inflation. The reality for people in semiretirement is that we have the highest rate of unemployment in the country and opportunities to take on more work are extremely thin. Older Australians in my community—and seniors around the country—are closely bound up in the lives of their extended families, and they see close at hand the pressures their kids face at a time of falling real wages and record household debt. They're often called upon as a childcare backup when early childhood education places aren't available or affordable or when casual employment and shift work springs a surprise on parents, who, because of their financial position and insecurity of tenure, aren't in a position to pick and choose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So along came last night's budget, with people understandably hoping for some direction from government. But in the end, it is just more of the same. It's 'Let's play the old tune once more with feeling'. The government remains intent on $80 billion in tax cuts to big business, when company profits are strong—billions of dollars to go to the same banks and financial institutions which otherwise have relied on charging people unnecessary fees, sometimes after they're dead! The Turnbull government are going to push on with removing the clean energy supplement, they're going to persist with the Medicare freeze, they're going to proceed with a further cut of 1,280 jobs in the Department of Human Services, with a further shift towards outsourcing and privatisation of essential services. That is a recipe for more delays; it's a recipe for more mistakes and more robo-debt disasters. The government that were elected nearly five years ago on the promise of no cuts to the ABC are cutting a further $84 million from our public broadcaster. There is not one new dollar for investment in infrastructure in my state or anywhere else, as far as I can see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest budget from the Abbott-Turnbull government continues their tradition of cuts to the things we share and largesse to the big end of town. There is no relief for those who need it most. It is a bitter disappointment. It is a dereliction of leadership and responsibility at a time when we need a government that will take on the big challenges and provide some solutions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  Firstly, I'd like the congratulate the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance for delivering a budget for all Australians—a budget that delivers more jobs, guarantees essential services and, through disciplined fiscal management, ensures the government is living within its means. The coalition government has a plan for a stronger economy and jobs. It was great to hear the member for Calwell recently talking about the coalition's Stronger Communities Program. It's great when a Labor member stands up and talks about our programs that are delivering to communities all across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economy is in its 27th year of consecutive growth. Business conditions are at the highest level since the global financial crisis, and global growth is at its fastest pace in six years. Through this, jobs are being created, investment is rising and the budget is strengthening, enabling the government to guarantee services that Australians can rely on. Our careful approach to spending and our prudent measures to improve tax and welfare integrity have played a major role in assisting the budget's return to balance whilst investing in key projects across our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think a lot of people forget that the government is actually spending taxpayer dollars. The benefits of a job and income, a wage and reward for effort are all reliant on a strong economy. As such, it is our responsibility to ensure the government is living within its means. I'm very proud to say that, for the first time in a decade, the government is no longer borrowing to pay for everyday expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last month the Prime Minister visited the great state of Western Australia to announce the coalition government's $3.2 billion infrastructure package—the largest single infrastructure investment we have seen, dedicating to keeping WA moving. The package is committed to busting congestion, improving safety for WA commuters and road users. It is beneficial to regional WA and people in the metro area like my constituents in Swan. This is on top of the $2.3 billion Boosting Jobs Busting Congestion package included in last year's budget, which included vital infrastructure such as the Manning Road on-ramp and the upgrades to the Roe Highway and Kalamunda Road intersection in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two key problem areas will be addressed by the new investment package. The first is the Welshpool Road and Leach Highway intersection upgrade. The $47 million invested in this project will ensure a dramatic reduction of congestion all the way to the airport. A further $144 million is being invested into the Roe Highway Great Eastern Highway bypass, a stretch of road that has become increasingly dangerous with heavy traffic. The intersection upgrade and the investment package as a whole will create thousands of jobs, stimulate economic growth and bust congestion, allowing commuters to get home more quickly and safely. The Treasurer and the coalition government have delivered a budget that is lower taxing, simpler and fairer. It is fiscally responsible and, importantly, rewards effort.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  In 2017 Gateway Health in Albury-Wodonga received $165,000, as part of Keeping Families Safe, the Building Safe Communities for Women program and the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, to work with the emerging refugee communities of Albury-Wodonga. Today it gives me great pleasure to welcome to the parliament two members of the Albury-Wodonga Ethnic Communities Council. Nivanka and Rupinder, it's great to have you here. Rupinder is a survivor of domestic violence. She's been part of the 'That Girl' program and has helped me in preparing this speech. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rupinder tells me the 'That Girl' program was a series of workshops and discussion regarding domestic violence and where to go for help. It resulted in a Bollywood-style dance performance, prepared with powerful lyrics, about the value and role of women. The words are: 'That girl is your mother who gave you life, that girl is your daughter, that girl is your wife.' Rupinder tells me that family and domestic violence is often a very stigmatised issue. Survivors are often isolated and shunned and victims do not know where to go for help. For Rupinder this program was a ray of hope, a program where over 60 women aged between five and 70 came together to empower themselves with the aim of breaking the silence on domestic violence and creating sisterhood. She tells me that the highlights of the 'That Girl' program were an amazing product of teamwork from many groups, such as the Albury-Wodonga Ethnic Communities Council, Gateway Health and others. They had practice sessions where everyone shared food, and it was amazing to see the different age groups and backgrounds working together. On the final day, every participant wore colourful, traditional cultural dresses representing their background and individuality, and there was an amazing show—a spectacular show of colours, music, dance, fun and, most importantly, women working together. I would like to say to all those involved, 'Congratulations,' and give a special call out to: coordinator Tricia, 'Well done;' and to Gateway Health; the Albury-Wodonga Ethnic Communities Council; Bhakti, Priyanka and Minakshi from the Bhutanese and Indian communities; and Celestine, Vivian and Patrick from the Congolese community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge the opening by our Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister on 24 April of the Sir John Monash Centre at Villers-Bretonneux. This was announced in April 2014 by the Abbott government, and the winning design was announced in April 2015, again by the Abbott government, and I'm delighted that this has now come to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of the past four years has been spent remembering the service and sacrifice of our forebears a century ago. The Great War was convulsive for our country, just as it was for the wider world. From a population of less than five million, some 400,000 Australians volunteered, 330,000 Australians served overseas, 155,000 were wounded and 60,000 never came home. Gallipoli, understandably enough, has dominated our imagination, but it was the Western Front where the great Australian effort was made: almost 300,000 Australians served and almost 46,000 died. Nowhere on earth is more richly sown with Australian sacrifice as our Great War historian Charles Bean has said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last six months of the war—we don't normally remember this—it was the Australian Army, the first Australian Imperial Force serving together for the first time under the leadership of General Sir John Monash which turned the tide of war and changed the course of history. The Battle of Amiens, which was planned by Monash and largely fought by Australians, was the black day of the German army and it set up the victories to come. Over the last six months, Australian forces—less than 10 per cent of the total British army—secured more than 20 per cent of the gains in that decisive period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's good that Villers-Bretonneux will now no longer simply be a place of pilgrimage but it will be a place of learning, a place of understanding and a place of inspiration to generations of Australians yet to come, to do great things in a good cause. We say every Anzac Day, 'Lest we forget.' Thanks to this Monash centre, we will remember.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to acknowledge the fine work of the French government, which managed to speed the approvals necessary to get this project done in record time. Michael Ronaldson, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs who drove it, and Paul Kelly and Patrick Walters, the distinguished journalists from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, who first reminded us we that we lacked in France an Australian museum like the British one near Pozieres and the Canadian one at Vimy Ridge. Most of all, we should remember John Monash and the Australian soldiers whose imperishable story will henceforth be much better known.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  One in 10 Australians aged over 65 is living with dementia. For Australians over 85, that number climbs to three in ten. That means that more than 425,000 Australians are living with dementia. Every day, 250 more people in Australia learn they have dementia. It is an issue of national and global concern. There is no cure. But as my mum says, for people living with dementia, you learn that they are more than memories, and mum knows. She lost her mum, my grandma, Mollie, and my dad, Grant, to dementia earlier this year. Her favourite saying is: 'There's still a lot of living with dementia.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, with my mum here—and my aunt and uncle, Trish and Ray—I want to share an initiative started on the Central Coast of New South Wales of which I am proud to be patron. The newly formed Central Coast Dementia Alliance is working to make the Central Coast a dementia-friendly community. They are health workers, service providers, business and community leaders working together to improve the health and wellbeing of people living with dementia, and of their carers and families. The coast is a great place to live and a great place to retire. One in five of us is aged over 65. That makes dementia an issue of concern in our community. Currently, nearly 6,000 people on the coast are living with dementia. I want to make their experience better than my grandma's and better than my dad's. That's the mission of our alliance: to make enjoying life easier. We have many good support services, but they can be tough to find.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first tasks of our alliance will be to map existing services and identify gaps. An equally important task will be raising awareness and providing education. Starting next month, the alliance, supported by Dementia Australia, will hold workshops to help people understand dementia and memory loss. We'll be working with businesses to make our shopping spaces safer and more welcoming. I'm delighted that Westfield Tuggerah has joined the alliance. I'm hoping businesses within the centre and other centres will join too. We hope this will improve understanding and help reduce the stigma felt by people living with dementia. It's important to note that a dementia-friendly community is not just good for people who are living with dementia, and for their carers and families; it's good for everyone. Some of this requires planning, big projects, lots of funding, but there are smaller projects too that we can start right now. That's what the dementia alliance is focused on doing in our community: small, practical, local projects that can make a difference in our community straightaway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People living with dementia can live well. People living with dementia deserve to live better. We can raise awareness, we can boost understanding, and we will reduce stigma and make enjoying life easier for people with dementia. I sincerely hope the work beginning on the coast will inspire other communities. I commend the members of the Central Coast Dementia Alliance for their excellent initiative.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  It's difficult to understand and reconcile that, in the 21st century, in a nation as prosperous as ours, the great country of Australia, we are still sending kids to school hungry. The parents haven't fed them. They haven't had breakfast. It impedes their ability to learn, to concentrate. It's a disgrace. A couple of months ago I stood in this parliament and advocated the importance of the School Chaplaincy Program—$380 million for the year. I was heckled by those on the other side of the parliament, who said, 'If we get into government, we're going to shut the chaplaincy program down.' These men and women around the country who give their time to make sure that our children, the next generation of Australia, are fed breakfast, do so not because of the religion they believe in; they do it because they know they're making our country stronger. They're making our nation greater.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It disappoints me that we don't have bipartisan support for the chaplaincy program. I take this opportunity to acknowledge that, last night, in the federal budget, Scott Morrison, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and finance minister Mathias Cormann made a contribution to the chaplaincy program and said they would continue to fund it—that it wouldn't be cyclical; it will now be ongoing. The great work that these men and women do in our schools is unfathomable. As for those that don't understand what the chaplains do, those that troll Facebook and suggest to me that these people are God-botherers and that there's no place in the community for chaplains, you're entitled to your opinion, but do me a favour: I encourage you have a chat to the principal of your local school, and ask them the value of what a chaplain does. They do absolutely incredible work. It saddens me that there are those on the other side of this parliament who, if ever in office, would seek to abolish the work that chaplains do. I'm proud to be a Liberal Party member. I'm proud that our government has stood behind the chaplains. I'm proud that we're helping feed the next generation of young Australians.</span>

It has failed the fairness test in education. Put simply, there's a $17 billion cut to our schools in this budget and a $17 billion gift in tax cuts to the big banks. There's a $270 million cut to TAFE, where the next generation of our skilled tradespeople would learn their trade. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It fails the test for pensioners. The pension age of 70 remains in this budget. They have not changed their minds about that. And they are still going to cut the energy supplement, which will be a $14-a-fortnight cut to pensioners. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It fails on infrastructure. It fails dramatically on infrastructure for Victoria. Despite the $5 billion promised for the airport-to-city rail link, there is only $250 million to be spent in the next four years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It fails on housing affordability. There is nothing in this budget that will help young people in my community get into their first home, even if you take into account their $10 tax cut. Let's look at that. Medium house prices are $450,000 in my community. A 10 per cent deposit is $45,000. Ten dollars a week for a couple is $1,000 a year, so they're going to be saving for 45 years. So this budget fails the housing affordability test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also fails the home-care and aged-care fairness test. There was a lot made of the 14,000 places for home care announced last night—3½ thousand places a year. Put that against the fact that in the last six months alone the waiting list for home care packages has gone up by 20,000 people. This is another fail. The government have failed to address the aged-care crisis. They have failed to react promptly to home care, and we all know what the preventative savings are there. They have also failed on health. There's a $1 billion cut implied in this budget and there are cuts to our hospitals, which will make waiting lists longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has not taken any of the opportunities it was given for this budget. They've done nothing about housing affordability. They haven't taken up Labor's ideas there. They haven't taken up Labor's ideas in the health area. They haven't taken up Labor's ideas in education. This budget is all focused on the big end of town—$80 billion worth of tax cuts for big business and the big banks while everyday Australians will suffer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I have to admit that green is not a colour I often wear, but today is different. You'll notice that many of my National Party and LNP colleagues are also wearing green today, and it's all for a serious cause. Central Queensland's beef industry was saddened recently by the passing of Maurice Binstead. Maurie, as he was mostly known, lived a long, pioneering life of service. He was a devoted family man, who, after serving his country in Papua New Guinea in the Second World War, directed his energy to building his life in the beef industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maurice was never one to take the status quo for granted and was a driving force behind the formation of the Cattlemen's Union during the beef depression of the 1970s. Maurie and a group of graziers decided that they'd had enough and wouldn't tolerate the structural issues within the beef industry any longer. This group was often seen as radical within the conservative grazing sector. However, many of the changes they adopted are now seen as the foundation of the economic viability of agriculture in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maurice's life was also devoted to his own grazing operations, which, through shrewd management and land development, grew to be significant. Maurice was a pioneer of land development in Central Queensland, increasing productivity hugely. Maurice Binstead developed his land by clearing areas of thick brigalow country on his properties, allowing the land to grow more grass, feed more cattle and grow more beef. The success Maurie and his colleagues had in developing his land led to the state government delivering the brigalow scheme, a series of divisions of leasehold land delivered by a ballot to graziers, with the express requirement that they develop their new parcel of land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This development delivered untold wealth to Central Queensland's beef sector and led to Rockhampton becoming the undisputed beef capital of Australia. But now, unfortunately, the prosperity of CQ and the memory of what Mr Binstead and his contemporaries achieved is being destroyed by a green Labor government that is anti farmer, anti development and anti jobs. So the green we wear today is in recognition of our primary producers who deliver so much to our local economies, keeping our rural towns alive and keeping food on our tables and clothes on our backs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By ramming through legislation that will stop our farmers and graziers from not only developing new country but also protecting their country from woody weeds and regrowth, Labor has sold out Central Queensland once again. I stand today with our farmers and graziers and call on all Australians to remember, regardless of where you are, to thank a farmer for your next meal. The memory of Maurice Binstead will be held dear to farmers and graziers across the country for many years to come. He was a man who helped change the way the beef industry operated, delivering more power to our hardworking graziers and opening up so much of the economic potential of Central Queensland. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  Of course I rise to support the general thrust of this bill, because it will add to the governance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, but I want to make some comments arising from the second reading amendment that the member for Kingsford Smith moved. I think it's important at this juncture, as we reflect on the evidence that's been elicited through the royal commission into the banks and some of the commentary that's been around in respect to that evidence, to give a bit of context around a few things we should have learnt from recent and slightly less-recent circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few things we should have learnt from the global financial crisis. There are a few things we should have learnt from fees-for-no-service scandals. There are a few things we should be learning now from the banking royal commission. One of those is that we need a strong regulator. Another is that we need strong regulations. A third is that we need to address the power imbalance between consumers and banks. Deputy Speaker Irons, how many times have you heard—and I'm sure it's quite a few, given that you're the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services—people saying to you, 'You just can't beat the banks'? That's what people in my electorate say to me. They feel powerless in the face of banking misconduct and, more broadly, in the face of banking power. You can see why people might feel that way when you hear scandals like fees for no service or just the everyday price gouging, the fees in relation to ATM use or the very high credit card interest rates. It's no wonder people feel powerless in the face of banking and financial services in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I want to talk about these three things is that we are dealing with a bill that arises—belatedly, admittedly—from the financial systems inquiry report that was handed down in mid-2014. I know the government gave its reply in October 2015, more than 12 months after the report was handed down. I also know that we are just now, in 2018, looking at some implementation of the recommendations, in respect of banking and financial services regulation, that were made in that 2014 report. I want to make the point that the answer to the problems of neoliberalism, problems like instability and predatory practices, is not more neoliberalism. This is an experiment that has failed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are today seeing the legacy of decades of neoliberalism across this world. We are seeing its legacy here in Australia. We are seeing its legacy in the United States and the United Kingdom. And we are seeing its legacy from the global financial crisis that shook the world and became what is known outside Australia as the great recession. Of course, it's not known as that here—because we didn't go into recession during the global financial crisis in Australia. But every other major economy did. The world very briefly started to learn the lessons of that financial crisis and started to turn to greater regulation of financial services. Unfortunately, we have already lost that motivation and momentum to look at greater regulation. That is a very grave shame. If we look back at what's happened in the intervening decades since the global financial crisis, we should all be very worried about the propensity of current systems to lead to further crises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about three things I think we need: a strong regulator, strong regulations for the regulator to enforce, and empowered consumers. I have heard some members of the Liberal and National parties suggesting that somehow it can be laid at the feet of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that banking and financial services misconduct has been occurring in this country. We all want to see ASIC step up, be a great regulator and enforce the law very well. But let's not make any bones about it, this is a regulator that has had its funding cut. The 2014 budget cut $120.1 million from ASIC over five years. Dribs and drabs of funding have been restored to ASIC since then, but not enough to make up for the cuts that were made in 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw the attempt to remove ASIC and other white-collar regulators from the use of telecommunications data, the metadata regime, when it was overhauled. It was Labor that fought to have white-collar enforcement agencies like ASIC included in the regime. And not only has ASIC been deprived of resourcing; they have also been deprived of the regulatory tool kit that has been recommended for them. One of the things that was recommended in the financial systems inquiry was some additional powers for ASIC, not just for enforcement but for making regulations. And we're finally seeing now, in 2018, almost four years after the financial services inquiry report was handed down, some implementation of those additional powers in relation to the creation of design and distribution obligations and in relation to temporary product intervention. So the government has not only sought to tie ASIC's hands behind it back by reducing resourcing; it has failed to equip ASIC with the tools that even the government's own financial systems inquiry—it was conducted independently but it was commissioned by the government—recommended would be required for ASIC to be able to be a better regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just that the government has failed to properly deal with the cuts that were made back in 2014, it's not just about the very slow movement when it comes to equipping ASIC with those powers that were proposed in the financial systems inquiry. It's also that the government has basically said to ASIC: 'Keep your hands off the banks'—in big glaring letters. In 2014 the then new government gave ASIC a statement of expectations. What was in that statement? The very final concluding paragraph summarised what the government wanted from ASIC. It said that the government wanted ASIC to 'reduce compliance costs for business'. That's what the government wanted ASIC to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That statement of expectations had very little to say about consumer protection but a lot to say about 'risk based enforcement'. Risk based enforcement means: 'Don't enforce the law against everyone, just go after some big fish.' It also spoke about 'principles based regulation'. That means: 'Hands off, light touch, be general, don't be prescriptive.' So with those three things in it—the direction to reduce compliance cost for business, risk based enforcement and principles based regulation—and the failure to have a focus on consumer protection, the statement of expectations basically said to ASIC: 'Be a light-touch regulator. Hands off. Let the market do its work. Work with the regulated population.' Of course ASIC should have a relationship with those it seeks to regulate, of course it should understand the industry; but there's always a trade-off, isn't there?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The closer you get to industry the better you may understand it, but the closer you are to an industry the more difficult it can become to be a tough cop on the beat in respect of that industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC was told to engage in this very light-touch, hands-off approach by the then Treasurer in 2014. For this government to now stand up and say, 'Well, ASIC should have been a firmer hand; it should have been a stronger regulator; it should have been a tougher cop,' sits a bit ill in the mouth of a government that failed to create a statement of expectations that told ASIC to do those things. The Financial System Inquiry recommended a new statement of expectations be issued back in 2014, and in 2015 the government said, 'Yes, we'll do that by mid-2016.' When was it announced? It was announced in March 2018. That's when that new statement of expectations was announced. The government, having been dragged to looking at the actions of ASIC by the royal commission into the banks and by the work of Labor and others, finally got around to saying, 'We're so happy to make an announcement. We've finally settled on a new statement of expectations.' Well, that's great. That's fantastic—you were told about this in 2014! Four years is a long time for people to have to wait for the government to finally take some action on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of the government's approach to the banking royal commission. We had 601 days of excuses, delays, obfuscations and refusal before we finally got a banking royal commission. After Labor campaigned so hard for it and kept pushing for it in this parliament and after members of the community demanded it, we finally got a banking royal commission—and thank goodness we did. I know there would be people out there watching it very closely and seeing some of the stories—stories about charging fees to people after they have died, more stories about misconduct and more stories about poor behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that we finally have a banking royal commission. I'm sad that it took 601 days. I think it was pretty gobsmacking for the Prime Minister to say, 'I'm sorry; it obviously was a political mistake to oppose the royal commission.' How out of touch do you have to be to think that the main problem with refusing to support the royal commission was the political cost to the government? This isn't about the government. It's not about the polls. It's not about how popular the government is. It's about the fact that this conduct could have been exposed sooner, that this royal commission could have commenced sooner, that this pressure to finally take action to enforce the law, to equip the regulator with powers, to work on creating the competition mandate—another thing that's been under discussion for a very long time—and to work on creating the product intervention powers and the disclosure and distribution obligations could have commenced sooner. The pressure to do all of the things that the government said back in 2015 that it would do could have come on sooner if the banking royal commission had started a little sooner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These ideas about how to make our regulator stronger have to be situated within the broader context of changing the way we think about financial services and banking regulation. The light-touch, hands-off approach isn't working. It's certainly not working now, if it ever worked. I'm pleased to see that the competition mandate has been conferred on ASIC. I'm pleased to see that ASIC will be explicitly required to consider whether there is enough competition in the banking and financial sector. As you know, Deputy Speaker, the previous chair of ASIC said very clearly before our committee that he didn't think there was enough competition within the banking and financial sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that there will be a specific focus on competition, but it's not enough, is it? With the size of this market and the regulation that we have now, we will tend towards an oligopoly. We know we will, because we have—we can see the evidence before us when we look at the financial services sector. We have to take a new approach, and that means saying, 'In Australia, we believe that the banking and financial services sector should serve the people.' It's an industry that is so important to our entire economy. It's important, of course, as an export. It's important that we reach out to other nations with the great financial services that we can offer. But, most importantly, it's important for our domestic economy that we have confidence in the financial sector. To have confidence, we need regulation that will ensure that the banking and financial sector acts in a way that serves the interests of the community. We need to remove perverse incentives to engage in wrongdoing, misconduct or just garden-variety predatory behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, we need consumers to be stronger. It's time for a much stronger consumer protection focus. It is just a nonsense to say that a small-business owner can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. It is just a nonsense to say that a pensioner can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. It is just a nonsense to say that a kid out of high school can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. We need to improve consumer protection in this country. Consumer protection should be at the heart of what we do when we look at how to improve the way that ASIC operates, that banking and finance regulation operates and that general approaches to the market in this country operate. It's not good enough to say: 'We'll leave it to the invisible hand of the market. People's enlightened self-interest will lead to optimal outcomes.' It's not the case. We know it's not the case because we've got decades of neoliberalism to look back on in this country. We know it's not the case because of the evidence that's coming out before the royal commission right now. I appreciate the bill, I respect the moves for greater governance and I hope that things get a little better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018 amends the ASIC Act to provide the Governor-General with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. Labor supports this bill. This bill forms part of what I see as the first tranche of legislation that this government is belatedly bringing forward to implement changes to our financial services regulatory framework in reaction to the royal commission, which it avoided holding for so long. The regulation and the regulatory framework are something that it has avoided changing and improving for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that the government has announced its intention to nominate Daniel Crennan QC to fill this new deputy chairperson role, and an excellent appointment he will be. But why have we ended up at this place? It all comes back to an issue that the outgoing chairperson of ASIC identified some time ago, which is that we have a fundamental failure in the way in which ASIC is regarded, not just by the public at large and not just by those that it seeks to regulate but, critically, by its international colleagues around the world. It is not seen properly as a law enforcement agency. ASIC cannot just be some cuddly regulator working closely with those companies, organisations and individuals that it seeks to regulate, gently pushing them and prodding them towards better behaviour. It has to carry a big stick as well. It may walk quietly, but, without that big stick of actually being a proper law enforcement agency, that gentle cajoling ultimately will have no effect. This change—introducing a second deputy chairperson role and making sure that the head of enforcement fills that role—is a very positive change to create a better perception of ASIC in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I said: how has this all come about? It has come about because the government has realised it suddenly has a problem on its hands. Suddenly it sees it as a political issue. Now that we've finally got to a situation where we are having a banking royal commission and issues are starting to come out, the government needs to make sure it has strong and effective regulators to back the strong and effective—oh no; we're still waiting for the laws to come. Not only do we need to have a strong and effective regulator that is a proper law enforcement agency; we need to make sure that it has the powers to do its job properly. In particular, we need to make sure that it has the penalties to back up the offences that it's trying to go after. But I will come to that again towards the end of my speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back and look at ASIC under the term of this government and why it's ended up in this predicament reputationally, a lot of it goes back to the government's 2014 budget, its first budget, where it moved to slash the funding to ASIC, where it gutted our key corporate regulator. And then, in an effort to forestall and avoid holding a royal commission, the government said, 'Nay, wait: it's okay; we'll restore the funding.' But, as we've seen in numerous committees that I've sat on, and others, it takes quite a time once ASIC gets its funding restored for it to bring its capability back up to scratch, and even now there is a question mark over whether that capability is still fully there. So we still suffer the consequences of those cuts back in 2014 by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And those cuts can't be just seen in isolation. I thought it was astounding that we saw the Treasurer go out and say that we need to make sure that we effectively throw the book at corporate crime and the crimes that may have been committed by the big banks in this country after some of the revelations that have come out through the banking royal commission. I thought about that, as a former federal prosecutor myself: how is he going to do that? He might say, 'I've restored the funding to ASIC,' and he may well say, 'Look, I've got a tough cop on the beat and I'm going to make the head of enforcement the deputy chair of ASIC.' But who's going to prosecute it? The government has cut funding. It has slashed and burned through the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions office. When we look at yesterday's budget, the government has said, 'We'll give the Commonwealth prosecutor an extra $3 million in about three years time so it can do some enforcement around the illegal importation of tobacco.' But it hasn't given any extra funding to prosecute the crimes that the Treasurer himself has said should be prosecuted coming out of the banking royal commission. He's all bark and no bite, this Treasurer. So we see that the government is consistent when it comes to funding its law enforcement agencies; it's just consistent in the wrong way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Related to this, after the Financial System Inquiry, the government promised to update the ASIC statement of expectations. It said it would do that by mid-2016. But it took until this year, 2018, for the minister to announce that new statement, and the minister did that only after a significant amount of pressure applied by Labor through the Senate estimates process. This is quite an important document. We're talking about ASIC governance in this legislation, and this document goes to the heart of the government's expectations about how ASIC will fulfil its mandate. In the meantime, up until this point we've been left with the Abbott-era statement of expectations from 2014—remember, that's the period when ASIC had its resources gutted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we also turn back and look at what the priorities were for the Abbott Liberal government at that time, let's look at FoFA. The Future of Financial Advice reforms that were introduced by the former Labor government were of course opposed by the coalition, who voted against them at every opportunity. Then, when they got into government, they tried to repeal them, and then they tried to stop them from operating through regulation. When they couldn't do that, because we successfully disallowed those regulations in the Senate, the Minister for Finance cooked up a great little scheme with ASIC where they said, 'Well, let's just use your power to defer the operation for two years so that we can let the industry adjust'—an industry that had already had about two years to adjust when Labor passed the legislation in the first place. This has of course meant that we had more time during which improper fees were charged to Australian consumers. Indeed, ASIC has worked out that the amount of fees that have improperly been charged to consumers is effectively over $200 million—and that's not including interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the FoFA opt-in requirement—again, introduced by Labor—which would mean that financial advice clients with ongoing fee arrangements would have to opt in to that relationship advice, and pay for it, every two years. It seemed quite reasonable—unless, of course, you're the coalition; they're not really into this transparency with the customer. ASIC subsequently concluded that this reform significantly reduces the likelihood that customers will continue to pay fees for ongoing advice services if they do not wish to receive those services or pay those fees. Well, that sounds quite good. But, instead, a number of financial services and entities decided they would just charge the fees regardless of whether they gave any advice—indeed, they would charge them even after people died.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned tougher penalties earlier. ASIC's been onto this for quite a while. ASIC first asked this government for tougher corporate penalties back in 2013—some five years ago. Indeed, if we look at some of the revelations that have come out of the banking royal commission recently, some of the conduct which the commissioner said is likely criminal would have incurred these higher penalties if the government had got around to introducing the higher penalties when the regulator asked for them in the first place. That's not to mention the impact that the government says is going to clean all of this up—that's its Banking Executive Accountability Regime. The Treasurer has mentioned this quite a bit recently. I think he even mentioned it in his budget speech last night. But the thing I don't understand is that the Treasurer says this is going to clean up all this behaviour when the legislation clearly says that it has nothing to do with consumer outcomes—it's all about prudential regulation. It actually has nothing to do with this. I and Labor have been quite critical of this. In fact a parliamentary committee report handed down recently—a consensus report across all parties—said the Banking Executive Accountability Regime should be extended to apply to bad behaviour towards consumers by the banks and financial services. That's what they did in the United Kingdom, and that's what this regime is apparently based off, but the government can't even do copying properly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, just today, we have seen that the Commonwealth Bank have finally settled their bank bill swap rate case with ASIC. They've settled that by admitting to a number of cases of unconscionable conduct and manipulating the bank bill swap rate. They will pay a penalty and donations to financial service literacy organisations of $20 million. It sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the tax cut this government wants to give them. But I will commend ASIC for taking the hard line when it came to the bank bill hard line swap rate cases. It took all four banks to court in relation to that matter. It has settled with three of them so far and obtained some significant penalties. However, it is concerning that the state of the law, and the state of ASIC's resources and the Commonwealth DPP's resources, has meant criminal charges were not brought to bear in relation to any of that conduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to all of these things we have seen critical failures by the government. They have allowed a situation to exist where there is effectively no confidence in our corporate regulator. It is good that they are bringing forth this bill. It is good that they will elevate the role of enforcement to the level of the deputy chairperson of ASIC, and we support that. We support them in making sure there are tougher penalties. We support them in making sure ASIC has more powers; that it has the powers it needs to be the tough cop on the beat of corporate crime in Australia. We need to make sure not only that that happens here but also that it's seen to happen overseas, because there is criticism of ASIC such that other law enforcement agencies in this area will not give full cooperation with ASIC because they don't regard them as a law enforcement agency. This is very concerning, and the government needs to address it, as it does with so many other matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to this specific piece of legislation, well done, government—eventually, years later, you have got around to fixing a small problem. We look forward to you eventually fixing some others. </span>

                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I commend the member for Burt for his great contribution and the great work that he's done in making sure regulators do the right thing. Like the member for Burt, I'm happy to speak on this Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018, a bill that amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act to provide the Governor-General with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shortened version of this speech is that Labor supports an additional deputy chairperson. Why? Because of the important work that ASIC does. They have the responsibility for regulating Australian companies, financial markets, finance services organisations and professionals who deal in and advise on investments, superannuation—I'll return to that in a minute—insurance, deposit-taking and credit and have responsibility for consumer protection and conduct regulation. I particularly mention superannuation because I noted this week that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke was a bit crook. I want to wish him well and thank him for the great work that he and Paul Keating did in bringing in superannuation for everyday Australians. Now, at the end of the last quarter, we have $2.6 trillion in superannuation funds largely due to the efforts of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating and the trade union movement, obviously, in bringing in superannuation. My understanding is that's the third largest managed fund in the world. It's amazing to think of what a simple idea can blossom into. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we've learnt one thing over the last few weeks—that is, corporate governance is important, especially in the finance sector. I know the trade union movement takes its role very seriously, especially when it comes to those industry boards, where it's normally a fifty-fifty split of employers and employees. I know they do great work. We need strong and effective regulators. Why? If you don't have them, the cowboys or the crooked culture will spring up like mushrooms after rain. If you don't have a good cop on the beat, making sure they're doing the right thing, bad behaviour creeps in. Having an additional deputy chairperson will assist ASIC to be a stronger and more effective regulator, to undertake its functions with more flexibility and to engage with stakeholders. If ASIC is not able to effectively carry out the responsibility assigned to it as a regulator, it's not just the top end of town that has a hiccup; we all lose. ASIC has already been given new powers of oversight, and the Turnbull government has proposed that further responsibilities be given to ASIC, such as the management of expected additional disclosures following reforms to whistleblowing laws and administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime. To properly carry out these new responsibilities, ASIC must have the resources it needs to operate effectively. Labor supports this bill because Labor supports appropriate regulation of Australian companies, Australian financial services and Australian markets. We believe in good governments and in sensible governments, and all would do so. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is worth remembering that, unfortunately, in the 2014 budget, the coalition government made significant cuts to the resources of ASIC—and this was while the member for Wentworth was a member of the Abbott cabinet. Some of these cuts were restored when the government was facing down a banking royal commission, but I remember them making the cuts in the first place. And, sadly, the damage has already been done. As you would expect, if you reduce the capabilities of a regulator, they can't properly regulate. The result is a financial sector where misconduct has become the norm. You see a race to the bottom, where cowboys and crooks set the standards. Anyone that does want to do the right thing will unfortunately have the cowboys and crooks say, 'No, no, we're undercutting that person.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott and Turnbull governments have shown complete contempt for the important role that ASIC plays in Australia's corporate sector. In response to the financial system inquiry report, released in December 2014, the government promised to update the statements setting out the government's expectations for how ASIC will fulfil its mandate. They promised they would be updated by mid 2016, but it took until 2018 for them to do this. That is totally unacceptable. We know where the Turnbull government's priorities lie. It's not hard to see. It was again evidenced in the budget last night, when they confirmed their $80 billion tax giveaway to big business. Remember: $17 billion of that taxpayer giveaway will go to the banks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For 601 days we saw the Turnbull government running a protection racket for the big banks by resisting the Labor Party's calls for a banking royal commission. They were very quick to declare royal commissions when they came into office but not so quick when it came to something that will benefit the Australian people. They were happy to go after a government scheme that was rolled out during the financial crisis and they were happy to go after Labor leaders, calling up what may or may not have happened 20 years before or the like. Bill Shorten was hammered with question after question for a political process, some might say. For 601 days, the Turnbull government resisted calling a royal commission, when financial misconduct continued unabated and in fact actually blossomed. For 601 days Australian mums and dads and small businesses were being ripped off mercilessly. For 601 days the Prime Minister continued to argue that there was no need for a royal commission. It was only when the big four banks themselves wrote to the Treasurer and told him that the government should call a royal commission into the banking sector that finally Prime Minister Turnbull relented. The banks told him when to jump and how high. It was unbelievable that a Prime Minister of this country could be dictated to by the banks. Surely nobody would now dare argue that there was no need for a royal commission into the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. I haven't seen any apologies from those opposite, saying why there were 601 days of delay. Who knows what heartbreak we may have avoided if they hadn't needlessly delayed for 601 days?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time the coalition has been riding shotgun for the banks and financial sector. When Labor was in government, the coalition was in fierce opposition to Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws. I see the member for Oxley in the chamber. I know he's very passionate about some of the small lenders and the shonky practices that go on in this area. Those laws gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice, but this coalition voted against those laws in the House and the Senate. When they got into government, they then tried to gut them. It was only the continued resistance of Labor that stopped the government from decimating the Future of Financial Advice laws. There is no doubt that these laws have proved their value. ASIC has been able to identify $200 million in fees that the big four banks and AMP have been taking from customers despite providing no service at all. Imagine that: $200 million taken from everyday people without providing anything at all—even, as we've heard, after the customers are actually dead. The ASIC report <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial advice: fees for no service</span>, delivered in October 2016, found that although great systems were in place to record what money was coming in, there was no system to establish what customers were getting in return—in many cases, nothing at all. As a lawyer, you're used to charging for your advice. As a paediatrician, you're used to being paid for a service.</span>

Imagine still being paid for the delivery of a child when they're 30 years old—it'd be a great lurk if you could do it—or, as a lawyer, giving out advice and then being paid 30 years later for the advice you gave on that day. One of the reforms Labor introduced as part of its Future of Financial Advice laws was the opt-in requirement. This requires ongoing financial advice clients to opt in to fee arrangements every two years. That simple opt-in requirement, which I believe could've been tougher, was opposed by the coalition even then. The member for Higgins, now Minister O'Dwyer, said at the time:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC, however, in their 2016 report praised this opt-in measure:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This reform significantly reduces the likelihood that customers will continue to pay fees for ongoing advice services if they do not wish to receive those services or pay those fees.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether in government or in opposition, the coalition have consistently fought against measures that would protect customers from misconduct in the banking industry. They fought against protections for customers in the face of numerous horrendous instances of banking misconduct—misconduct ignored by the Turnbull government even when the government's own regulator, ASIC, reported it to them. Just last year, two of the big banks, NAB and ANZ, both settled cases with ASIC for $50 million each. I think today I heard that CBA had also settled a similar case. Justice Jagot of the Federal Court was reported to have said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was not a judge talking about drug dealers; this was a judge talking about people that represent some of the strongest pillars of our economic society. The ASIC commissioner, Greg Medcraft, understands this is a shocking, systemic problem. He said earlier this year:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From what we've seen so far in the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, this tree has serious rot in the trunk. We have seen headlines in the past few days about directors resigning, despite continuing to deny any wrongdoing. I always love that. The royal commission has heard that AMP was forced to confess that it made almost 20 false or misleading statements to the corporate regulator regarding fees for no service that they applied to customers after their financial adviser retired. This was a conscious policy taken by the company to charge customers fees for 90 days after they no longer were receiving any service. It's shocking that this would occur at all, but it is more shocking that it was a policy of the company and known by those with authority within the company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AMP is not alone in this misconduct. The Commonwealth Bank's financial advisers had been charging dead clients for financial advice—no complaints from those customers, obviously!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In one case, the adviser knew that the client had died in 2004 and continued to charge service fees for a decade after the client's death. Again, this was not an isolated case. There were many former clients who were deceased who were being charged service fees for years after they had died.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other evidence to the royal commission, we heard that home loans were being approved based on fraudulent material provided by brokers. There were real consequences of this behaviour. In one instance, a family had already paid out significant funds to the builder and had their home loan collapse due to the misconduct of the broker. At the same time, the family was facing the devastating loss of their baby. These are real families with real lives. These are real tragedies, with people being treated as playthings by the financial sector. Claims have been made that NAB staff accepted bribes of $2,800 in order to look the other way and accept loans based on fraudulent documents. NAB staff were incentivised to engage in this misconduct by bonuses that were available to them if they reached certain loan targets. I would point out that I don't begrudge the poor staff, who were often held to ransom rather than incentivised, I would suggest, by their bosses and supervisors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Finance Sector Union and the union movement generally for pointing out some of the flaws built into these remuneration systems. The banks and their staff have been getting richer at the expense of ordinary Australians, many of whom have been left devastated. Ordinary Australians have lost their homes, ordinary Australians have been left bankrupt and ordinary Australians, I'm sad to say, have even taken their own lives—all because of the exploitive lending practices and just plain greed of the big banks. The conduct of banks and the financial sector affects each and every one of us. We all have those constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's impossible to go through life and not have some relationship with a financial institution. If you hold a bank account, use a credit card, apply for a home loan, hold insurance or are a member of a superannuation fund, you'll have a commercial relationship with a financial institution. You rely on your bank or financial institution to act responsibly with your money and to do so in your interests. We've all assumed up until now that that is what they were doing. The sad reality that we're now all aware of, thanks to the banking royal commission, is that they've been playing us for mugs. Even worse, they've been playing us for mugs and the Turnbull government has been protecting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was brought kicking and screaming to having a banking royal commission. He didn't want it. His team didn't want it. They tried everything they could to avoid it and, in the end, they only called it when the banks told the Prime Minister to do so. We know that the Turnbull government will always look after the big end of town. His background is in banking, as it is for so many of the frontbench. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will do all it can to make sure that ordinary Australians have the protection they need, that the culture of misconduct in banking is stamped out and that our financial institutions serve the nation, not the interests of a greedy few. Labor supports this bill. Labor support our corporate regulator, ASIC, and we wish them well. Labor will always support measures that assist ASIC to operate effectively and efficiently.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. I start by acknowledging the commitment of the previous speaker, the member for Moreton, and I note that today we will also hear from the member for Herbert—both Queensland representatives who are firmly on the side of the consumer and customer, unlike this government, which is on the side of big banks. I think it is telling that, when you look at the speakers list today, you see that not one member of the government is getting up to defend this legislation. Perhaps they're not interested. Perhaps they're not interested in hearing the true facts regarding the impacts and how we can improve the situation and protect consumers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018, as we know, concerns the governance of ASIC and the direction of the Governor-General to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. As we heard from the member for Moreton and our spokesman, Labor do support the bill. We commend the government for legislating to assist ASIC to better operate as an effective and efficient regulator. But—and it's quite a big 'but'—it has only come after years of cuts to and attacks on ASIC by this very same government. It took the teeth out of this regulator, which resulted in thousands and thousands of Australians being taken advantage of. We are only seeing this now because of the advocacy and strong representation by the Leader of the Opposition, by the shadow Treasurer and by the shadow finance minister, who called for a royal commission into banks and financial services, to protect consumers and to protect customers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important as part of today's debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill to add a little more context as to where we've come from and why we're here today. I want to place on record the facts. In reading through the legislation today and reading through the statements by the minister—after taking $120 million in budget cuts from ASIC over four years, and let's acknowledge that this began in 2014—the government want somehow to be congratulated for their belated attempts to fix the mess they started four years ago. Four years ago we saw the introduction of the cuts to ASIC; we're now fast forwarding to 2018, where we've got a bill to somehow improve and strengthen the powers of ASIC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to these savage cuts, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in its annual report released back in October 2014 that the impact of the $120 million in budget cuts would mean its ability to fulfil its role would be 'substantially reduced'. The report included estimates of reduced surveillance staff levels in 2015 for every focus area bar one. We know that these changes conveniently came at a time when the government attempted to change rules that would have allowed financial planners with six years experience to give tax advice. We know how that movie ends; it's not a happy ending. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The writing has been on the wall for some time as to what the cuts and changes would mean for ASIC, and what that means for Australians. At the beginning of 2016, Choice said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cuts to ASIC funding … have significantly reduced its oversight capabilities and opened the door to more unscrupulous activity in the financial services sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Choice analysis found that, because of the cuts and subsequent reduced resources of ASIC, 751 fewer surveillance activities took place in just the two years since the cuts took effect in the 2014 budget. It also found a 57 per cent decrease in the number of actions against potentially misleading or deceptive promotional material. We are dealing with a new measure today, which, as I acknowledged, as part of this legislation, is a step in the right direction. But, in light of recent events, this quote from Choice's analysis perhaps sums up the government's approach to ASIC:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We rely on ASIC to monitor the likes of CBA, NAB, ANZ and Macquarie Bank and ensure consumers' interests are protected. ASIC is doing a lot with very little. However, with $120 million being ripped from the regulator over four years it's undergunned against some of the world's most powerful financial institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it makes sense that, if you as a government decide to reduce funding, reduce resources, reduce the powers and surveillance of an oversight body, there are consequences. And there have been consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has since moved to restore only some of this funding to ASIC, after we began calling for the royal commission, of course. Even then, it was so they, I guess, could look like they were doing something and keep running a protection racket for the banks. However, the impact of those cuts on ASIC's capabilities cannot be undone so easily. These were cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator and a free pass to financial sector misconduct. The cuts are consistent, in my opinion, with the attitude that saw the government spend 601 days bitterly resisting the urgent need for a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector, as we've heard from previous speakers in today's debate. Now, let's be clear on this. Members of the government—from both the frontbench and the backbench—week after week, month after month, would talk on Sky News, talk in front of cameras and talk in front of the media, saying, 'We don't need a royal commission.' They were proud of it. They were patting themselves on the back. They were clinking champagne glasses, meeting with the top end of town and saying, 'Don't worry: we're going to hold the tide, we're going to fight them every step of the way. We're not on the consumer's side; we're on your side.' That's what the government was saying, right from the backbench up. They were going into the boardrooms of some of the most powerful institutions in the country, saying, 'It's okay. The Labor Party, the broader community, consumer action groups, the victims—no-one is going to listen to them. You've got the big talking stick and we're going to cuddle up to you and sidle up to you. We've got your back.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened? Community protests happened. The stories were told of people being ripped off right across the country. We saw members of the government go a bit wobbly. Who can remember that great lion in the north, George Christensen, the member for Dawson—a little pussycat when he comes here. 'I'm going to cross the floor. I'm going to bring the government down.' Remember all of that? The member for Herbert was in there fighting for consumers and for the customers of Herbert. The member for Dawson, allegedly, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mercury</span> up there, was beating his big chest, saying 'I'm going to sort the banks out'. He comes down here, a little pussycat—or rather a little mouse running down here—he gets slapped over the wrist by the Treasurer, by the PM's office and by the Deputy Prime Minister—whoever it was back then—who said, 'You know what—you're not going to cross the floor.' Then he lied to the media or misled the media. </span>

                    </a>  I know the member for Mackellar is very—we know who you are. So do the banks. We know that when it came to action, consumers and customers could not be relied upon. On that particular note, I want to put something on record regarding this piece of legislation today and the further influence and strengthening of powers that it will give to ASIC in terms of its governance structure. When the rubber hit the road a matter of weeks ago, and we saw the first tranche of victims coming forward to the royal commission and telling their very powerful stories about how the banks had treated some customers, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services appeared on ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>. In describing the minister's refusal to come clean, media reports at the time described it as a disastrous interview. We've all seen it on our social media feeds, with the minister refusing to give a straight answer to a very simple question: was the government wrong to stall on calling a royal commission into the banks, given the appalling evidence that we had heard just that week from consumers and customers? We note that in the media reports in the article on five occasions the minister failed to answer questions about her past opposition to this inquiry. That totalled 10 unanswered questions on the government's delay on implementing a royal commission, even though in July last year the minister responsible was quoted as saying there would be 'no benefit to customers'. This is the person in charge of financial services in this country, who proudly said a year ago that we didn't need a royal commission because it would be of no benefit to consumers. Talking about withdrawal and apologies, I think it's about time that the minister came into this place and apologised to the consumers and customers for not listening and not caring about them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there can be no doubt whatsoever that this government was wrong to delay the royal commission into the banks as long as it did, and in doing so—let's be clear—allowing Australians to be ripped off. It may not be enough to fix the problems of the past, but it's a start. Having a second deputy chairperson will support ASIC in engaging with its stakeholders to better communicate its role, its priorities, and how its resources are allocated. It will provide greater flexibility for the commission to determine how it undertakes its oversight and other governance functions. But given the shocking evidence presented to the royal commission so far, it's clear we need strong and effective regulators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times, ASIC's role has been expanding. ASIC has new direction powers to strengthen its oversight of the new one-stop shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. I want to note that the government has also proposed that ASIC be responsible for the management of expected additional disclosures following reforms to whistleblower laws. And ASIC may soon also have new responsibilities for administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australia's corporate markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator, we need ASIC to operate as effectively and as efficiently as possible. That's why, today, Labor will be supporting this bill. This is more than can be said for the member for Warringah, who, instead, has called for everyone employed at ASIC to get the sack. That's right: the member for Warringah, after hearing about the startling revelations and misconduct of the banks, took aim not at those who'd committed the horrid acts but instead at the regulator, who the member for Warringah, when he was Prime Minister, gutted to the tune of $120 million. Speaking on the matter, the member for Warringah said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… all the existing regulators should be sacked and people who are much more vigilant and much less complacent go in their place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This level of hypocrisy within the Abbott-Turnbull government is astounding but not surprising. This is the same member, who, as I said, slashed $120 million from ASIC's funding over four years when he was Prime Minister, when he was the then leader of the government, in 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have a long record of turning a blind eye to what is going on with financial misconduct in the financial sector. We should never ever forget the coalition's opposition to the previous Labor government's Future of Financial Advice, or FoFA, laws and their attempts when in government to reverse them. The FoFA reforms gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice. In opposition, the coalition voted against FoFA in the House and voted against FoFA in the Senate. When they got into government, the coalition tried to gut FoFA by legislation and then regulation. I'm proud to be part of a party that fought tooth and nail to stop this, and it was lucky that Labor prevailed in the Senate in stopping this from happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when it comes to the protection of consumers, the rights of consumers, there is one side of politics that will always call out misconduct, that will always call out people being ripped off, and that is the Australian Labor Party. We are the party that has fought tooth and nail to deliver a royal commission, standing shoulder to shoulder with consumers and customers in this country. It took this government months, if not years, to deliver a royal commission. Now we need justice for everyone in Australia.</span>

'Greedy', 'dishonest', 'mistrust', 'dodgy', 'criminals'—sadly, all too often, these are the words we hear used to describe Australia's financial and big business sector. As the member for Herbert, a community that has deeply suffered because of corporate greed that includes the likes of Clive Palmer and Storm Financial, I ask: is it any wonder that the financial sector's reputation is damaged in my community and around the nation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again, newspapers and social media feature articles about the corporate greed that is rife in this country. The royal commission into banking—a commission that, by the way, the Turnbull government didn't think we needed to have—has highlighted the lengths and depths that the finance industry is prepared to go to to make money: practices that promote the notion that the end justifies the means regardless of who gets hurt along the way. As we all know, thousands of people have been badly hurt and damaged. The royal commission has revealed just how fast and loose the Australian banks have played with Australian families' and workers' livelihoods. We have witnessed bank bosses who were aware of widespread fraud but did absolutely nothing. We have witnessed banks and financial services charge for non-existent services and then lie repeatedly to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission about their practices. This behaviour is deplorable, it is disgusting, and it is led by pure corporate greed at the expense of innocent people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But none of what the royal commission has unearthed is news to Australian families and workers, especially those who have been impacted. We have known for years about the deceit and destruction that the victims have experienced, because they have been telling us. Sadly, this government just would not listen. The reports, the surveys and the pleas from the victims begging the LNP government to do something have been there for the last six years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has chosen to do nothing but ignore Labor's calls and fight against every opportunity to do something to end this disgraceful situation. The evidence has been there all along. In 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Corruption: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rom the boardroom to the backroom</span>. Surely, the title of the PwC report is a dead giveaway as to what the it would include. Obviously, it wasn't as clear to those in government, the elected representatives who sit opposite to me, because they chose to do nothing. Allow me to enlighten those members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report found that 50 per cent of Australian organisations experienced white-collar crime in the last two years, from the date of the report's release. Of that, 47 per cent suffered more than 10 fraud incidents over that time frame. Of the 57 per cent who were victims of white-collar crime, one third of organisations lost more than $1 million. If you think it would be worse elsewhere, you are very wrong. More Australian organisations have reported significantly more white-collar crime than our global neighbours. Just 32 per cent of countries in the Asia-Pacific region describe themselves as victims of white-collar crime, compared to Australia's 57 per cent. It is no wonder, when you look at the toothless tiger laws for white-collar criminals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who commit white-collar crime in Australia are getting off lightly compared to those found guilty of similar offences in other countries. Let's compare and contrast. People who provide financial services without a licence in Australia can only be fined up to $34,000. In contrast, people guilty of the same offences in the US face a maximum fine of $5.6 million. In the UK, the fine is unlimited. The maximum civil penalty in Australia for giving inappropriate advice is $200,000 while in the UK the fine is unlimited and in Hong Kong it is the greater of $1.4 million or three times the benefit gained by the wrongdoer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Studies show that individuals who break corporate rules in the US may have prison sentences of up to 20 years. In Australia, and most other jurisdictions studied, the maximum prison term is 10 years for criminal penalties such as fraud and insider trading. The maximum  prison term for providing financial services without a licence in Australia is just two years. On top of imposing fines and prison terms, regulators elsewhere can remove financial benefits that wrongdoers have obtained through illegal profit or avoided losses. ASIC does not have that power, although it can ask other agencies to bring an action to confiscate the proceeds of crime. The relatively low fixed fines that ASIC can impose and the fact that it cannot remove the proceeds of crime itself means that wrongdoers may still profit from their conduct and not be deterred by the penalties. ASIC is not to blame for this, as they have been screaming at the top of their lungs for harsher penalties for many years. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The penalties, particularly civil penalties, in Australia for white-collar offences are basically not strong enough, not tough enough. All you're doing is giving them a slap on the wrist [and] that is not deterring people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said you have to 'lift the fear and suppress the greed'. There you have it: comments clear as daylight from the person who knows, lives and breathes these corruptions all day, every day. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, Mr Medcraft has gone a step further. Last year he called Australia a paradise for white-collar crime. On top of the fraud, deceit, tax evasions, money laundering and lies there is a new business model being used by these greedy corporations. That business model is wage and superannuation theft. This is the latest threat for working Australians. Instead of a perpetrator climbing in your window at night to rob you, businesses are instead robbing workers' back pockets. Almost every single day I am meeting a local Townsville resident who is owed either wages or superannuation. At a mobile office a couple of months ago, the entire staff of a retail centre stated that they were affected; they were owed both wages and superannuation. There are people in the Herbert community who work in the hot sun all day, six days a week, as tradesmen, who are owed over $100,000 in unpaid wages accumulated over a number of years. Herbert has the highest unpaid or underpaid superannuation in the entire state of Queensland, with more than 22,000 people owed money that totals over $53 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the people affected are textile workers in Townsville who have not yet been paid their superannuation payment for more than four years. Some of these workers are almost 60 years of age; they are close to retirement, and they want and desperately need their superannuation as they are not wealthy people. Two weeks ago, I stood with the textile union and workers to call out the dodgy practices and unpaid superannuation impacting on local workers. These are people who haven't been politically active previously but are standing up and fighting a system that has allowed this sort of behaviour to occur. They are standing up and fighting back against the Turnbull government, which just does not seem to care about them. I believe Gordon Gekko, an infamous movie icon who represents the epitome of corporate greed, said it best in the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">oney Never Sleeps</span>, where he said, 'Greed is good. Now it seems it's legal.' Given what has been revealed in the royal commission hearings, this quote does appear to be 100 per cent correct. If there are not effective laws to punish white collar criminals then they will continue to get away with robbing Australian families and workers. If there aren't the resources in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission then there is no-one to police these crimes. And if there aren't the resources in the Australian Taxation Office then there is no-one to make these organisations pay outstanding superannuation. But instead of the Turnbull government investing in resources for ASIC or resources for the ATO, they are making massive cuts. The Turnbull government has cut 110 jobs from the ATO's Townsville office. That's not only local jobs; that's resources for investigating dodgy white-collar criminal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the former commissioner for ASIC, Greg Medcraft, has called for more resources and support from the Turnbull government, when he said: 'If we want to react faster then having more resources to be able to do it is important.' None of this is news for the Turnbull government. Whilst the Turnbull government is making cuts and underfunding the organisations that are there to police and protect families and workers from these dodgy companies and practices, this government is rewarding corporate greed by offering an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks. How out of touch can you be? On top of the cuts and ignorance, the Turnbull government is demonising the one entity that has always supported workers and has always looked after Aussie workers and their families and, of course, I am referring to the mighty union movement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I was proud to march alongside my union comrades to celebrate Labour Day, a day when we remember the battles fought and won by Australian workers and unions. There have been many battles fought by my comrade predecessors, but none have been as tough as the challenges that workers and unions face today—the challenges thrown up by this out-of-touch, top-hat Turnbull government, a government that has no concern for Australian workers and their families, and a government that will not recognise that families are struggling every day to make ends meet.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will fight against the Turnbull government's cuts, especially those to the ATO in Townsville. I will stand up for workers who haven't been paid their wages and superannuation, and I will continue to fight—</span>

For example, it allows for the appointment of an additional deputy chairman of ASIC. And it's not beyond time that we see change at ASIC. It's not beyond time that we see change in the enforcement of Australia's corporate laws. We know that ASIC sits at the heart of preventing the kinds of scandals that we've seen at the royal commission that is being held in Melbourne as we speak. We know that it's important because the Treasurer told us. He told us for 600 days that there was no need for a royal commission into the banking and financial sector in Australia because we had ASIC, a corporate watchdog that was 'a tough cop on the beat'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the result of it? We've seen this government get every call wrong when it comes to banking and financial services regulation, and they have made the wrong calls because they have got the wrong priorities. The government, led by Prime Minister Turnbull, are in it for the big end of town. They are in it for the banks, not for rural Australians. They make the wrong calls because they have got the wrong priorities. That's why they fought this royal commission for 600 days. It's why, even in the face of ongoing shocking revelations and disclosures from members of the public to representatives in this parliament, when the government were dragged kicking and screaming to initiate this royal commission, they made it very clear that they didn't want it to happen. We heard it called unnecessary, a populist whinge and reckless. And on the day they caved in and initiated the royal commission, it was called regrettable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then we've seen the most shocking revelations of rorts and rip-offs in the banking and financial sector in Australia, new revelations that we did not know about before this royal commission was initiated. We have heard revelations about banks charging fees to customers who they knew were dead. We have heard about banks charging customers fees for services they didn't provide, services that they knew they weren't providing. We've heard endless stories of dodgy financial planners giving self-interested advice and ripping off their clients. We have heard stories about financial planners impersonating their clients on the phone to superannuation funds. We have heard them giving advice to switch to a super fund associated with them. That would have incurred exit fees. In one example that was heard at the royal commission, that would have cost one man a quarter of his superannuation in exit fees. Another person was given advice by her financial advisor to bundle her superannuation into a self-managed super fund in a way that would have cost her $500,000. It would have helped the celebrity financial planner who gave her the advice to do that. Half a million dollars! We've heard about it being common practice at NAB to falsely witness documents inside the company, documents dealing with the life savings of Australians. We've heard about one in 20 pieces of financial advice coming out of ANZ being 'inappropriate' because the advice was either in the self-interest of the financial planner or they didn't appropriately investigate other options for advice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do I flag these issues? I flag these issues because, in every one of these cases I have talked about, the misconduct occurred during the 600 days that the Turnbull government was delaying the royal commission. It wasn't historical conduct; it was happening while the Turnbull government said everything was fine. It was happening while we had that 'tough cop on the beat' protecting Australians—ASIC, the subject of the bill before the House today. Despite this, the government continues to refuse to apologise for this delay. We've heard Prime Minister Turnbull say it was a political mistake.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WATTS:</span>
                    </a>  I encourage the member for Mackellar to learn some parliamentary procedure, and to read the second reading amendment, to get across what is in this debate. Even the Treasurer said we didn't need the royal commission because of ASIC, the subject of the bill before the House today. Prime Minister Turnbull still won't apologise for delaying this royal commission. He said it was a political mistake. So he gets that it has hurt him. The politics look bad for the Prime Minister. As a politician, yes, I can sympathise with some political pain, but what about the scandals that hurt Australian consumers? They are the ones who have suffered. When is the Prime Minister going to apologise to them? When is the Prime Minister going to apologise to the one Australian who lost a quarter of his superannuation, based on dodgy financial advice from AMP, during the 600 days that the Prime Minister delayed this royal commission? Where is his apology? I'm sure he doesn't care about the political damage that the Prime Minister has incurred. That's not his priority. They make the wrong calls because they have the wrong priorities and the wrong values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The governance problems we have seen with ASIC—some of which this bill is trying to address—are a function of the Turnbull government's approach to ASIC. What has ASIC done? When ASIC appeared in front of the royal commission, we found that it had 'never' pursued civil penalties against a financial adviser for dodgy advice. It has pursued only one criminal prosecution of a financial advice licensee this decade. This isn't a coincidence. This is the result of the policy framework put in place by the Turnbull government for ASIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Abbott-Turnbull government were elected, in the 2014 budget—that was a cracker; do you remember that one? It went well!—they gouged $120 million from ASIC's budget. In their statement of expectations to the regulator, they told them to 'minimise compliance costs for business', and they did this despite ASIC warning the government repeatedly that their proactive surveillance would be substantially reduced due to these cuts. That's the governance framework for ASIC. If you take money away from them, if you reduce their headcount, you reduce the ability for that tough cop on the street to be effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government only started to restore some funding to ASIC after Labor began calling for the royal commission. It was only designed to make it look like they were trying to do something, to stave off the royal commission. Even restoring the funding to ASIC was a way of trying to protect the banks. But the damage was already done. The impact of these cuts on ASIC's capabilities can't be reversed overnight. Inside ASIC, you build up that competence, that capability, that institutional knowledge of enforcement, over time. They ripped it out. Now we've got to put it back. These cuts were to the capability of the corporate regulator and gave a free pass to the financial misconduct we've seen in the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area where it's really clear that this enforcement framework has just been completely misunderstood by the Turnbull government came with respect to the Labor Party's Future of Financial Advice reforms. This was the other plank to the way that the Abbott-Turnbull government dealt with ASIC when it was elected. It cut its funding, told it to minimise compliance costs for government and tried to rip the guts out of the most substantial consumer protections for Australian recipients of financial advice. Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms were critical, because we know, from the evidence at the royal commission, that they were changing behaviour at the banks. The Future of Financial Advice reforms only came into force in the first year of the Abbott government. They were introduced by the previous Labor government but they only came into force under the Abbott government. We know, from the evidence of the banking executives at the royal commission, that they were changing behaviour. When you change the law to require financial advisers to act in the interests of their clients, not themselves, guess what: their behaviour changes. At ANZ they changed their remuneration practices. They changed the way they give bonuses, not only to financial advisers but to the executives supervising them, saying: 'The law requires us to put the customer first, so maybe let's start doing that, as a corporate citizen. Maybe let's start paying people on the basis of this advice.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FOFA reforms also gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice. They banned conflicted remuneration. They instituted a duty for advisers to act in the best interests of clients and created an obligation for advisers to renew ongoing fee arrangements with clients. This is ground zero of the financial advice scandals that we've seen in the royal commission, and the Abbott government wanted to remove them. They wanted to get rid of the protections that were there—such as they were; we've seen how inadequate they were from the evidence in the royal commission. They have made every wrong call, because they have the wrong priorities. The only reason that we've retained the obligation for financial advisers to act in the interests of their clients is that the Labor Party wouldn't cop these changes. We went into bat for the Australian public when the Abbott-Turnbull government was going into bat for the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point in time, after 600 days of delaying the banking royal commission, after an extended period before that of gutting the corporate oversight regime, the corporate law enforcement regime governing corporate Australia, it's clear that we now have a crisis of trust in the Australian public for corporate Australia. We need to restore confidence in the banking sector. Our financial system depends on trust and confidence. That's what banking is about. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the royal commission into the banks needs to be able to run its course. It needs to air all this dirty laundry; we need to get it out there. And those who have presided over misconduct need to take full responsibility. When the commissioner of ASIC, Greg Medcraft, warned that there were subcultures operating within the banks that were not meeting community expectations, you knew that the system had a problem. Mr Medcraft warned against people characterising misconduct in the banks as 'a few bad apples' and at the start of 2017 he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Stop saying it's a few bad apples. At some point you've got to look at the damn tree and say, what's wrong with us as an organisation? That's what I am saying to these guys.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australia's corporate markets, financial services and consumer regulator, we need ASIC to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible, but we also need corporate Australia to take some responsibility for the scandals that we've seen. I'd like to see some shame. It's not asking too much, with the revelations and scandals that we've seen in the royal commission. It's not asking too much for the Australian public to see accountability, to see some responsibility taken. If I were a board member of these companies, I'd be ashamed. I'd take responsibility; I'd resign. I wouldn't fluff over it with euphemism. I'd take responsibility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to call some attention to AMP's media release on 30 April, 2018 advising of AMP chairman, Catherine Brenner, 'stepping down' from her role as chairman for her company misleading ASIC on 20 occasions and her involvement in an 'independent report' into this behaviour. I want to compare that with the statement of Steve Smith, the Australian test cricket captain, following his one-year ban for Australian cricket's ball-tampering scandal, just to illustrate the corporate rot that has beset corporate Australia and how to respond to it. The lack of shame on AMP's part is astounding. Steve Smith started his statement after the ball-tampering scandal with the words, 'I'm sorry'. In AMP's statement, the board did not take direct responsibility for misleading ASIC; in fact, it cleared itself—it said the board had not engaged in inappropriate conduct and that the chairman was just stepping down. I don't know why. They blamed the legal counsel for it. AMP talk about being disappointed in the conduct of others and euphemistically talked about the chairman stepping down. They say that the general counsel and company secretary will 'leave' the company. No-one's getting sacked here. No-one's being held accountable. Excuses are being made. Steve Smith showed empathy for those affected by his actions, declaring, 'I now understand the consequences. I'll do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused.' AMP states, 'The board is satisfied they did not act inappropriately.' Where's the accountability? Where's the shame? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to change the culture of corporate Australia. Some of that comes from the governance reforms we see here with ASIC. But it also takes an intrinsic change in the way corporate Australia does business. The game of mates has got to stop. The covering up for misconduct has got to stop. The excusing of oversight of governance arrangements within companies—where a company can lie to the regulator on 20 occasions, where they can knowingly charge fees for services that aren't being provided, where they can doctor a supposedly independent report to remove references to executives—will not restore confidence in the Australian corporate sector. We need a tough cop on the beat. We need ASIC to start doing its job as an external oversight, but what about governance inside the companies that it's overlooking? That's the change that we need to see in corporate Australia. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I want to start by congratulating the member for Gellibrand on the comments he has just made. This member of parliament has taken time out of his incredibly busy schedule to actually sit through some of the hearings in the royal commission. I must say, I wish more of those on the other side of chamber were taking an interest in the goings-on of this royal commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A huge amount is going on in Australian politics at the moment. We have High Court decisions and a budget, but the thing that people stop me in the street to talk about is the royal commission. I don't think there is a full appreciation across this parliament of the depth of anger and dismay that exists amongst Australians, as the culture of unbelievable greed and corporate misconduct is being revealed in this royal commission. The member for Gellibrand, who is going to these hearings, understands what is going on and the way it's affecting our constituents. I congratulate him on his passionate speech and the interest he's taking in this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps unsurprisingly, I will be returning to the subject of the royal commission, but I want to make a few comments briefly about the substance of the bill before us today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. As you've heard from previous speakers on the Labor side of parliament, we are very happy to support this bill. The bill amends the ASIC Act to provide the Governor-General with the opportunity to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. We note the government has announced its intention to appoint Mr David Brennan QC to this role. Labor supports the addition of a second deputy chairperson to ASIC. We believe this is important to assist ASIC's operation as an efficient and effective regulator. It will also provide a bit more flexibility to the organisation in how it divides work between its different chairpersons and deputy chairpersons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is an opportune time for us to be looking at governance reforms to ASIC, because the evidence that has been presented to the royal commission, if nothing else, shows us that there is a crucial and dire need in this country for strong and effective regulation of our corporate sector. ASIC plays a crucial role there. ASIC has a new directions power to strengthen its oversight of the new one-stop shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. We also note that the government has proposed that ASIC be responsible for the management of expected additional disclosures, following reforms to whistleblowing laws, and for administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it is crucial that, at a time like this, we look at those opportunities to improve how ASIC is working. I don't think I'm alone in this chamber in believing there will be more substantial reforms down the road to how ASIC is functioning. If anything, it's a little bit disappointing that only a pretty minimalist approach is being taken with the reform before us. It is a good, straightforward reform coming through the parliament, but through the royal commission we are seeing an organisation buckling under the incredible extent of this culture of greed and corporate wrongdoing in financial services. The very sad reality for us as parliamentarians is that ASIC has not been approaching these difficulties from a position of strength. The truth is that, since the Abbott government was elected, very significant cuts have been made to ASIC. The government moved to restore some funding to ASIC, but that was only after this push to support a royal commission into financial misconduct came from within the community and the Labor Party. Those on the other side of the House spent 601 days running a protection racket for the banks against the royal commission. They had to be seen to do something about the problem that was so evident to just about every other Australian, and I think giving some additional funding to ASIC was somewhat of a sop to make it look like there was some attitude of practical activism to try to deal with this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to the banking royal commission, I will speak about the amendment put by the member for Kingsford Smith. When I returned to Canberra this week, it was abundantly clear to me, having talked to my constituents out in the community, that the level of unspeakable anger about what is happening in our banking sector is not understood across the chamber. Labor members of parliament today are lining up to speak about the bill before us because, I know, they want to address the intense feelings their constituents have about the royal commission. One of the things that are very distinctive about the royal commission into financial misconduct is that in a sense all Australians are victims of it. We have victims at the lower end: people like me and many of my colleagues here who have been paying fees for things that shouldn't have had fees attached to them, and all the other bits and pieces that have gone on for ordinary Australians, right up to people who have had catastrophic financial impacts—people who have lost their homes. In the royal commission we heard about one extraordinary situation where a very well-educated woman was given advice that she should roll over her super into a self-managed super fund. That single move would have cost her half a million dollars. As I walk the streets in my community I've got people coming up to me trying to tell me their stories. I'm very proud to say that Labor is 100 per cent behind this royal commission. We need to give this royal commission the time and resources it needs to get to the bottom of these incredibly deep-seated difficulties and deep-seated problems of culture within financial services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share some of the examples that I have read about and heard about through the royal commission that I see as most egregious and most emblematic of some of the deep-seated problems within this sector. I am quoting from an article by Dan Ziffer which was reported in ABC news. It's a report on some of the first public hearings of the banking royal commission. These are some of the things that came out just in those first few days: cash envelopes filled with bribes, problem gamblers getting credit extensions, and a bank manager transferring $35,000 directly to foreign scammers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend a bit of time talking about the National Australia Bank, because—my goodness!—they are one of the organisations that has come into focus, shall we say, in the royal commission. During the hearings on some of the issues facing the National Australia Bank we heard about staff being involved in an alleged bribery ring covering multiple branches; forged documents; fake pay slips and Medicare cards; and bribes being paid in cash to secure loans as staff responded to an incentive program to sign up new customers. I am quoting from an article from Gareth Hutchens in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>. I want to pause on this incentive program that was created by the National Australia Bank to sign up new customers. It was called the introducer program at the National Australia Bank. The bank decided that it would pay ordinary people—not financial experts, but people such as gym instructors—commissions for referring strangers to the National Australia Bank to ask for home loans. What could possibly go wrong? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to really make this clear. What we're talking about here is a bank that paid ordinary people with no financial expertise money to encourage other Australians to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars with a bank to make probably the biggest financial decision they'll ever make in their life. They did this through this dodgy incentive scheme that was paid to people such as gym instructors. More than $24 billion in home loans was lent by the National Australia Bank under this scheme between 2013 and 2016. I want to remind the parliament that at the end of 2017 the National Australia Bank posted a $6.4 billion profit, and in that same statement they announced that they were cutting 6,000 jobs. I want to pause there, because it's $6 billion and 6,000 jobs being cut. This goes right to the core of the issue that's in discussion in parliament this week about the effect of the $80 billion in corporate tax cuts that the government has decided to place at the heart of its economic agenda. The argument being made is that if we give companies more profit they will employ more people. I know that argument is not washing with the Australian community, because it does not conform with the lived experience they have of being in the Australian economy. How can the government ever expect Australians to buy this economic craziness when we have a company like the National Australia Bank announcing on the same day a $6.4 billion profit and 6,000 job cuts? It's just ridiculous. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quote from an article called 'Banking royal commission is on track to expose a culture of greed'. This is from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span>. This recounts a situation in the royal commission where the Australian Securities and Investments Commission disciplined Aussie brokers over something called liar loans. I want to speak about liar loans because for me this is one of the clearest examples that the argument that it's just a few rotten apples, just a few people and a few financial services advisers doing the wrong thing, is completely wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These liar loans are where financial advisers deliberately falsify the income of ordinary Australians to entitle them to get home loans they would not be able to properly repay—because their income has been deliberately inflated by a financial adviser who is supposed to be acting in their best interests. The commission will be taking a particular interest in liar loans over the coming weeks because it's feared these make up a third of all Australian home borrowings. So if any member of parliament talks to you about bad apples and this being some small part of the industry, remember that figure. It's possible that a third of all Australian home loans have been authorised on the basis of income that's been deliberately and dishonestly inflated by financial advisers. It's absolutely shocking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't forget the Commonwealth Bank in all this because, my goodness, they have some issues to deal with. I want to mention the way that the Commonwealth Bank has approached the royal commission generally. As members of parliament will know, the royal commission has asked banks to account for their conduct by asking them to confess, essentially, to some of the things they've done wrong. The royal commission has not been given the time and resources it needs to go into these organisations on its own and search for misconduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Commonwealth Bank did, firstly, was write a submission to the royal commission which was flimsy. It was too brief, absolutely. The counsel assisting the submission talked about it being a 'high level and general approach' which 'did not disclose the totality of its conduct'. Come on, Commonwealth Bank. We are having a royal commission into your conduct. This culture of obfuscation, of turning your nose up at this parliament and the laws of this nation, has to end. The Commonwealth Bank had another opportunity to come back and give the information that's been requested by the commission. In its second submission it didn't do that. Instead, it provided an abundance of spreadsheets presenting information that was 'not in a form which made it possible to understand the type and scale of the bank's misconduct events'. This has to end. The Commonwealth Bank needs to accept that there is now some scrutiny around its activities—as there should have been 601 days ago—and it needs to understand that this royal commission will be looking into its activities and holding it to account. I have so many more articles here that I could talk about and—I can't believe it—we haven't even talked about AMP. AMP is the institution where we've seen the initial consequences of this unbelievable misconduct start to hit the fence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly talk about the fees-for-no-service scandal. What we understand now from the royal commission is that AMP was charging clients fees for services they did not receive. That on its own is shocking, but let's hear a little bit more. We know that in 45 per cent of those cases financial advisers were doing the wrong thing within AMP. In 20 per cent of cases the fees were not stopped for clients of advisers who'd been sacked. We'll understand more about the reason for that. In the rest of the cases, the reason they were being charged fees for services they were not receiving is that it was a business decision, to continue charging fees for no service while clients were transferred between advisers. Let's understand this. Leaders at AMP sat down and made a business decision to continue to charge their clients for services they were not receiving. This happened in a corporation in our country. It's a corporation that was meant to have been overseen by ASIC, the organisation that is the subject of the bill before us this afternoon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have nearly enough time to go through and deal with all the issues with ASIC. I'd simply make the point that despite all of the misconduct—the broken laws that we know are referred to, the counterterrorism laws which have been broken obscenely by the Commonwealth Bank—not one senior banker in this country has properly faced court in response. That's ASIC's job. So next time I talk about ASIC in this parliament I hope it's about a bill that does something a little more than make a minor change to the governance arrangements. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I would like to follow on from the shadow minister's contribution and also the contribution from the member for Gellibrand on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. What you see in this discussion today is a clear disconnect between an expectation that our regulatory bodies would, in particular, target bigger firms that have a wider impact and a much more devastating effect on the general public, versus what we're seeing where the regulators, I would dare say, go for the low-hanging fruit, which are the smaller firms and some of those that rely on ASIC to make quick decisions on implementing regulatory frameworks. The government's got a responsibility for that, and I want to talk about that today and principally what's happening with ASIC, especially in the fin-tech and early-stage innovation space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot about what is being debated here today that we would agree with. We certainly support—as we've said from the outset—the ability of this legislation to allow for the creation of a new deputy chairperson of ASIC. We note that the government has made an announcement about who that person would be, and we certainly support that initiative. We think that it will help ASIC in operating much more effectively and efficiently as a regulator and it will help improve the determination of oversight and the way that's conducted. We also think that it will help in terms of engaging with stakeholders. Obviously this will be crucial when considering the fact that ASIC is expanding its role in terms of consulting with stakeholders and providing oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has watched this with a particular eye to our growing fin-tech sector in this country—that is, those firms that are applying financial technology in a way to create new products and services that will ultimately provide greater choice for consumers as to what's on offer when looking at some of the bigger financial institutions in this country—I note that it's important that they emerge, it's important that new products be offered and it's important that competitive tension is in place, and fin-tech is providing that. I would say, though, that I'm increasingly concerned with the pace of reform in this area. There are a lot of words, a lot of announcements, a lot of media releases and a lot of things being said by the government about what they're doing in this space, but, when you put that against the reality, there's a gulf. I am increasingly being approached by fin-techs that are concerned that the words aren't matching the reality. I want to be able to work through that today, because, as I said, there is increasing frustration about the pace of change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC is in a difficult spot—I totally get that. The pace of technology, the increasing rate of disruption and the accelerated pace of change are posing a challenge to regulators in the financial services space, not just here but the world over. And it's not just in the financial services space; it's generally dealing with what tech firms are able to trigger, the types of things that you can see emerge, how governments recalibrate their legal frameworks to deal with the disruption that's occurring and the impact it might have on stakeholders. There might be someone who is cheering, but there will be someone who is not, because they're impacted by the change in a way that they feel is altering their ability to make their way in a modern economy. So I do appreciate that there's a big challenge for ASIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Australian context, the challenge is also in trying to promote innovation, particularly in financial services, but to do so in a way that protects consumers from some of the things that we've been horrified to hear about with respect to some of the big financial players and what they have done to banking and financial services customers. Obviously we are in an environment where the pressure is on to increase protection. I completely and utterly understand that, but some of these smaller firms want to be able to provide an alternative to what the bigger firms have been doing in products and services and in using data in a way that's consumer friendly and actually illuminates and builds awareness about options for consumers. Our fin-tech sector is doing terrific things and we need to see more of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three areas I want to particularly highlight in my contribution today. If you look at what's happening in the regulatory sandbox in the fin-tech space, if you look at what's happening on equity crowdfunding and you look at what's happening on initial coin offerings and the regulatory response that we're seeing so far, I think that there's a lot to be concerned about. We had a big announcement by the government, I think back in late 2016, or it may have been through the course of last year, that a regulatory sandbox would be created that would allow a much more regulation-light environment in which fin-techs could test out their products. In the time since that was announced we've had fewer than half-a-dozen fin-techs actually use the regulatory arrangements that were set up by the government and ASIC. If you compare that to what has happened in other jurisdictions, there have been a lot of firms that have wanted to use that regulatory space and develop products out of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been told that we have a much lighter regulatory arrangement than elsewhere, yet we've had hardly any fin-techs using our arrangements. We've been told that other jurisdictions are regulation heavy, but they've got more fin-techs using them. Clearly, something is going on. The government has flagged some changes that will be debated in this place at another time, but what is interesting to see is that the take-up here is low. The question is: what has the government done to see that type of result?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For equity crowdfunding we still don't have a final regime in place to allow a new funding platform to emerge for early-stage innovators in this country. What is notable about that is that five years ago, to this month, Labor referred this issue to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, asking that body—which the coalition wanted to get rid of later that year—to work out what the best regulatory framework was to allow for equity crowdfunding to emerge. That was five years ago this month. Four years ago this month they handed a report to the coalition—four years ago. We had very little happen until last year, when the government put forward a regime that we warned them would not be used. We warned them it would be red-tape heavy. We warned them it would come with extra cost to businesses and, as a result, the patronage of that platform would be low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We said that we knew they were going to change that regime, because the Treasurer flagged it himself in his second reading speech for that legislation. At the time I called it 'ScoMo's dodo', because that regime was going to go for one thing and one thing only: extinction. And, sure enough, that's exactly what happened. Six months later, the Treasurer introduced a new regime—the one that should have been brought in earlier last year. Now, what happened? It sat on the books. It wasn't debated. The government didn't prioritise it. Again, the government talk big about how they want to support fin-techs in innovation in this country, but when it comes to doing the hard yards they disappear. It didn't get debated last year. It didn't get debated when we resumed in February, even though we were told that it would come on. At the tail end of March, a few months ago, it hadn't been debated at all. So there's a drag in the way the government prioritises it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, there is another drag. The other drag is that they've baked into the legislation a further delay, which says that the new regime will not come into effect until six months after royal assent. This is after they did the same thing in 2017, where they baked in six months of delay. Now they're baking another six months of delay into the new regime that's supposed to fix everything. What's interesting about this is the ping pong that is occurring between ASIC and the government as to why that type of delay needs to be baked in. When you ask ASIC, as we did in estimates earlier this year, in February, 'Why have you got this delay baked in,' their argument is: 'We have to see what the parliament is going to do, and we need to do this for the processes—but we'll wait and see what happens.' When you approach the government on this, it says ASIC needs the time to prepare, even though they've had time previously to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When ASIC were questioned in estimates in February, they said, 'We have to understand the final form of the equity crowdfunding legislation,' because they have to make important changes to their database and information systems. They said that. When Senator Ketter, from the other place, said, 'I'm also led to believe that under the legislation to reform equity crowdfunding there's another six-month delay,' ASIC said they didn't have 'direct knowledge' of that. Really? It's there. We know about it already. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are aware of that time frame but that time frame is not in our hands … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what ASIC said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government tells us it's ASIC's concern. ASIC tells us it's in the government's hands. Can someone actually step forward and govern and put this new regime in place, because firms are relying on it to find a new form of funding. We are having that ping-pong put in place. ASIC say they need time to do this. But this week a new initiative put forward by ASIC, 'initial coin offerings' was reported by Yolanda Redrup in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Fin Review</span>. A special task force has been set up to monitor that. These ICOs are now emerging as an alternative to equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding is taking too long to be put in place in this country. So what is happening now is that ICOs are being relied upon as an alternative capital raising mechanism. The Melbourne based Haven Group raised $39 million through this. So instead of having a platform in equity crowdfunding we have to wait for this. We have to see alternatives emerge. They are being talked about increasingly as a way to raise money more quickly, without any of the regulatory oversight that we have seen. ASIC can find a way to put a task force in place there, but they can't find a way to bring to life a regime that has been flagged for over five years and we still can't see anything happen. So who is right? Is the government right in saying ASIC is worried or is ASIC right in saying it's the government's hands? We should be able to see better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government says it's pro innovation, pro helping small firms and pro helping the fintech community. The Treasurer is always out there spruiking his fintech credentials. With all that, they are slow in bringing in the regime. But one thing they are not slow on is grabbing money; they are not slow at grabbing money at all. Minister O'Dwyer has said that before the regime is even in place they will levy crowdfunding companies $5,000 each. That is what they are flagging they'll do in the near term. So the small firms that want to have access to alternative ways to raise funds are being told that ASIC's compliance costs will flow through to the small firms right away. We see very little action being taken on the big firms. Milk the small firms is the idea of a coalition government that is supposed to be pro business. The government claims credit one day but small firms have to pay for it the next.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly want to see strong regulations in place and we certainly want to see consumers being protected. The government makes a lot of promoting innovation. It puts out the press releases, does the press conferences and tries to claim the credit from stakeholders. But when it comes time for the government to stump up for this and get it happening, it doesn't do it. Our argument now—particularly in the other place, which is debating the equity crowdfunding platform—should be to entirely get rid of the delay that has been baked into that bill. We should ensure that the six-month delay is taken out, that the equity crowdfunding is put in place straightaway in the new financial year, and that ASIC move more quickly and be much more responsive to the concerns of the fintech sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector is too worried about raising their concerns with ASIC directly—but we are picking up the concerns along the way. If this government is fair dinkum about putting in place the measures that are required to open up competitive alternatives to big financial players, through fintech, they will act more quickly than they are doing right now. They will ensure ASIC is properly staffed to do the job and they will ensure that proper funding support is there so that we can see alternatives to the big banks and big financial players emerge in this nation much more quickly than what is currently occurring.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I too would like to make a contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. We on this side will always support the interests of everyday Australians. We have fought against corporate misconduct and the watering down of consumer protections. That is why Labor will support this bill. We will support all appropriate measures to assist ASIC to become more effective and efficient in its regulation of the financial sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the ASIC Act to give the Governor-General the discretion to appoint a second ASIC deputy chairperson. Amending the ASIC Act will provide for two deputy chairs and that, in turn, will provide greater flexibility for the commission to determine how it undertakes its oversight and other governance functions. A second deputy chairperson will be able to assist ASIC in engaging with stakeholders to better communicate its role and priorities and how its resources are going to be allocated. Essentially, that's why Labor will support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the royal commission into the misconduct of the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, there are certainly some big lessons to be learnt from that, including the need for strengthening the regulatory aspects of the financial sector to protect Australians. This calls for greater flexibility and increased capability to crackdown on misconduct and for adequate resourcing of the financial sector regulators. If we haven't learnt anything from the royal commission, I think we should at least acknowledge that there is that need to provide greater support for the regulator in that respect. Therefore, giving ASIC greater powers to protect consumers and rein in corporate wrongdoing means that the government can no longer be the unwitting, or sometimes witting—I'm not sure—accomplice to financial misconduct. I'll come to this a little later on but, with the benefit of hindsight and the damning revelations of the bad behaviour from banks and various financial advisers, the government has finally proposed tougher accountability regimes and making ASIC the one-stop shop when it comes to consumer complaints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did say that the government may be seen as an unwitting accomplice to financial misconduct. To put this in perspective, don't forget that it was the coalition government that defended the banks for far too long. The coalition have prioritised the banking sector and financial institutions over consumers—over the people. After the shocking evidence that has come out in the royal commission, it is clear that we do need better outcomes for consumers. For far too long the government has attempted to protect their friends in the big end of town and the banking sector by resisting any investigation into corporate misconduct. But don't forget that, in 2016, the Prime Minister, in resisting Labor's call for a royal commission into banking, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Bill Shorten's call for a royal commission into the banking industry is just another distraction, just a thought bubble … to respond to the news of the week.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAYES:</span>
                    </a>  It'll be on my website! As to the financial services minister, Kelly O'Dwyer's, view of the royal commission into banking, she was very succinct about it. She said, 'It will just be a talkfest.' We had ministers saying, 'It's only designed to make lawyers rich,' and the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, saying that Labor's push for a royal commission into banking was a 'populist whinge' that would not uncover anything of which the government was not already aware. So would you call the government an unwitting accomplice to poor behaviour in the banking sector, or were they really an accomplice to the bad behaviour in the banking sector? Again, I quote from the Treasurer, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think there is the great risk that if the opposition continues to engage in this recklessness that the only product of that approach could be to undermine confidence in the banking and finance system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's briefly look at the evidence that's been elucidated so far in the royal commission. I know the royal commission has some time to run, and possibly will be seeking an extension of time, because it seems the commission has taken seriously the complaints lodged before it. In relation to Commonwealth Bank, the evidence so far has been that it continued to charge a customer for services that were never provided, even though the customer had been dead for 10 years and the financial adviser knew it. It charged ongoing service fees to customers despite the fact the adviser never provided any advice to any customer at all and admitted to charging customers for advice that was never provided. It's not a ringing endorsement of 'Which bank?' Don't forget: this is the system that was being protected by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Financial Services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AMP you can see in the newspapers. I'm not sure if they have anyone left on their board now. They had a few departures. An AMP financial service adviser gave advice to a couple to switch to an AMP fund, even though it would immediately cost the husband $16,000 of his retirement savings and mean higher ongoing fees and charges for his wife. The counsel assisting the royal commission said that AMP misled the corporate regulator, ASIC, at least 20 times about fees being charged for services that weren't provided. An AMP executive admitted to the royal commission that he'd lost count of the number of times the company had misled the corporate regulator about fees charged for nonservice. Finally, the barrister assisting the royal commission said that AMP should be charged with criminal offences for misleading the corporate regulator in relation to fees for nonservice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for ANZ, their financial adviser that was before the royal commission is now being dealt with by the police for taking over $200,000 of customer money without authority. The same ANZ financial adviser told five of his clients that they should invest their retirement savings in an investment property of which he was the sole director. On each occasion those clients lost in excess of $100,000. You might say that's just a one-off bad apple, but the ANZ as a bank turned a blind eye to these concerns about the same financial adviser. By the bank's own admission to the royal commission, the commercial interest of the bank took precedence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of Westpac, a nurse told the royal commission that she'll now have to work until she's 80, because a Westpac financial adviser told her and her husband, a truck driver, to sell their house and switch to a self-managed super fund which was totally unsuited to their needs. It soaked up tens of thousands of dollars in commissions and unnecessary premiums in respect of insurances taken out, but they lost out all round because of the inappropriate product peddled to them. With respect to National Australia Bank, apparently it was commonplace for their employees to falsely sign a document as a witness—so much so that a NAB executive complained about having their bonuses cut when it was revealed hundreds of NAB employees were involved in falsely signing documents. They actually knew about these things, and none of these self-compliance aspects were reported to APRA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't forget: this all started when Commonwealth Bank was caught breaking money-laundering and terrorism-financing laws on 54,000 occasions. It has now resulted in a damning report by APRA. But, at a time when this government talks a lot about national security and border protection, we have seen one of our big four banks, one of the pillars of our financial system, on 54,000 occasions breaching money-laundering and terrorism-financing laws. There is no wonder that the public have lost confidence in our banking and financial institutions. They have lost confidence in a government that chose to defend the banks over the interests of the Australian people. This government were taken kicking and screaming to a royal commission. We can't colour that any other way. They opposed this outright, until the will of the Australian people was just so profound that they came, as I say, kicking and screaming to this position—where they predominantly wanted to protect their mates at the big end of town. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Prime Minister has admitted that the Australian people were not put first. The government, quite frankly, have a great track record of not putting Australians first when it comes to these major decisions. One of the first actions taken by the coalition government when they came to power was to gut Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms—powers which we had given to ASIC to crack down on poor financial advice, to ensure that financial advisers put the interests of consumers first and foremost in the provision of advice. The government dragged their feet in the calling of the royal commission, for fear of exposing wrongdoing within the banking sector, and it's taken a significant number of scandals to emerge for the government to realign their priorities and at least admit that they got things wrong in failing to endorse Labor's call for a royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Juxtapose that with the readiness of this government to have a royal commission into the working class of our land, a royal commission into the trade unions. The government, at every question time, at every opportunity, would recount the evidence taken by a royal commission which they spent $47 million on. And do you know how many prosecutions that wound up with? One. Against the wishes of even the royal commissioner, we had the then Attorney-General, before he darted off to Britain, extending the life of the royal commission, saying, 'You need more evidence.' The royal commissioner didn't ask for that, but the government wanted to give them more evidence, because this was a political stunt that they wanted to pull against Labor and those in the labour movement. They could not wait to have this thing extended. They wanted more and more evidence, and we got daily reports in the parliament about the issue of so-called corruption within the trade union movement. We have heard hardly a peep from the government so far about the misdeeds in the financial sector, particularly by the banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government has backflipped. It has backflipped and seen the flaws in its primary position of protecting the financial sector from further scrutiny. We do support this bill, because we think the provision of an additional deputy chair will assist ASIC in its operating efficiency and assist it to be more effective as a regulator in the financial sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jocelyn was elected to parliament in 1986 and followed in the proud tradition of pioneering Liberal women, including Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman elected to the House of Representatives, and Dame Annabelle Rankin, the first woman to hold ministerial responsibility in the federal parliament. Jocelyn's contributions to Australian women are extensive, both within and beyond the parliament. She was a foundation member of the Women's Electoral Lobby in Sydney. She founded the first women's refuges in Hobart and Launceston. Jocelyn defeated 12 men for nomination to replace Liberal senator Peter Rae, after his resignation. As the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women in the Howard government, she championed measures to get women into small business, along with momentous reforms to the treatment of superannuation after marriage breakdowns and measures to address domestic violence. As the Minister for Women, I feel very strongly that I build on the incredibly strong foundations set out by Jocelyn Newman with her enormous contribution in this space.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jocelyn was someone who marched to the beat of her own drum. She was courageous, eloquent and upbeat. After suffering herself from breast cancer, she used her public profile to encourage other women to undergo regular health checks. Jocelyn was a firm supporter of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and her right to have an abortion. She also spoke against the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, which was aimed at preventing the Northern Territory, the ACT and Norfolk Island from passing laws allowing euthanasia. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On these sensitive issues, her views were informed by her strongly held belief in personal choice. You see, Jocelyn was a warrior for the Liberal Party and for its values. Throughout her life, she fought for greater individual freedom, for choice and for lower taxation. In her first speech in the Senate, she exclaimed:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like her husband, Kevin, and her son, Campbell, Jocelyn gave much to public life, serving as a senator for Tasmania for 15 years. In addition to her time as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, she also served as Minister for Social Security and Minister for Family and Community Services during the Howard government, and she was of course a member of the Howard cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said that Jocelyn's contribution to the Liberal Party, to Tasmania and to Australia was by all measures considerable and enduring. And I was privileged to hear former Prime Minister John Howard also speak very movingly about Jocelyn at her state funeral very recently, where he talked of her compassion, her absolute determination and her ability to focus very much on outcomes and on delivery. And two of her granddaughters spoke lovingly of their grandmother, both the private woman and the public woman that she was. Our thoughts are with Jocelyn's family, including her two children, Campbell and Kate, and granddaughters, Rebecca, Sarah, Emma and Samantha. What an inspiring figure she was for those four girls. We hope that they can take comfort in her substantial legacy, which lives on for all Australians. Vale, Jocelyn Newman.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263070" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this condolence motion, and I thank the minister for her words to honour the life of a distinguished former resident of the city of Launceston and, of course, representative as senator for Tasmania. It is my distinct responsibility as the member for Bass to reflect upon the life of service led by the Hon. Jocelyn Newman AO, senator for Tasmania, cabinet minister, lawyer and advocate for causes, particularly women's rights before those rights were front and centre in politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her husband, Kevin Newman, was elected as the Liberal member for Bass in 1975. At that time, she had already served as a lawyer, practising in family law. She became active in addressing the plight of women and children facing domestic violence, something that is still a scourge requiring attention at the highest level in civil society today. At a practical level, she was a member of the Northern Regional Child Protection Assessment Committee within my electorate and assisted in the establishment of the Launceston Women's Shelter, as the minister referred to. In addition to that, she served as a board member on the Launceston Church Grammar School board. Having served my time in similar circumstances as a member of that school board and indeed other boards, I well understand how a sense of service and obligation requires people like Jocelyn Newman to serve many community organisations. The many eulogies to her spoke of her service to numerous community organisations, particularly with respect to women's groups and women's rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jocelyn Newman was described, as the minister has said, as a political warrior. In speeches to the House yesterday, there was more than a hint of her tenacity and the strength of her resolve in arguing her case. She served her political party, the Liberal Party of Australia, Tasmania division, with distinction. She held high office as a shadow minister for defence and subsequently, in the Howard government, as Minister for Social Security. She served in that portfolio for a period of five years, which, considering the complexity and challenge of the portfolio, deserves particular mention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It can be fairly said that there are clear and obvious differences between this side of the House and the government with respect to the issue of the social safety net and the extent to which a just society may be expected to provide support for those in need. There was nevertheless a paradox in Jocelyn Newman, in that she was prepared to argue the case for her portfolio with a degree of ferocity which spoke of her interest and care for those who were supported and required support from her department. Many have referred to the fact that she was informed by her particular conservative values. <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate</span> provides some assistance in understanding the challenges that she faced. A critic spoke of her as 'warm and compassionate' but said that her reactions to social problems were influenced by, 'decades of conservative ideology.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within two months of taking office, she spoke of simplifying the welfare system, and this remained a focus of her time in office. She regarded the creation in 1997 of Centrelink, the national welfare delivery agency and a one-stop shop for federal welfare services, as central to her aims, noting that it was very much 'my baby'. She oversaw the introduction of the family tax package, reforms to child support legislation and, importantly, measures to combat domestic violence and to assist its victims, and took particular pride in introducing amendments to the youth allowance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm told by one of my Queensland colleagues that it is significant that, when her son campaigned for office as Premier of the state of Queensland, he made one and only one significant promise, and that was in the area of funding for women's legal services. Given the reputation of the Newman government in Queensland for restraint and cutting the size of government, it is emblematic of her advocacy for women's issues that her son funded just such a program. Nevertheless, in her portfolio, she presided over a tightening of benefits and was attacked over changes to the funding of childcare centres and cuts to the funding of a number of communities and women's groups. Having regard to her passion and advocacy in this area, this would have been very difficult for her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always find it a matter of irony that those who engage in deep philosophical battles on either side of politics, those who are engaged in the most fierce political debates, those who advocate for change and those who possess such a driving force of personality can be struck down by the cruellest of diseases—in this case, Alzheimer's. As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, the terrible thing about Alzheimer's disease is that you become estranged from the qualities and person that so many people knew and admired. As the minister said today, many who knew her well described Jocelyn Newman by using expressions such as 'fierce', 'a warrior', 'strong', and 'a determined person'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to acknowledge the role that she played in bringing female representation to this place. Whilst there are differences as to how each of the main parties propose to address the deficit in female representation in parliament, in wider political and commercial life it should not be necessary for parliamentarians to emulate what must have been extreme adversity for Jocelyn Newman to obtain preselection and, ultimately, election to this place. In making this observation I don't wish in any way to demean the extraordinary service of Jocelyn Newman or others from her era who rose to serve despite all the impediments placed in their way. Rather, I would like to reflect upon the fact that diversity of representation in this place should be and must be celebrated. It is vitally important that women and girls of Australia realise that election to the Parliament of Australia and elevation to the boards of public companies should be seen as their right, absolutely without discrimination in any form whatsoever. It is also vitally important that we celebrate the contributions of those who have served, irrespective of political difference.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  I do not support the amendment but I do support the original motion. I'd like to use this as a bit of an opportunity to talk about the NBN rollout, where it is in my electorate at the moment and why we need this legislation. The NBN rollout in Grey is 98 per cent complete. That's a fantastic number. I'm looking forward to it being 100 per cent, but 98 per cent is a very good number. It's no secret that the NBN is not the NBN that the Prime Minister, when he was telecommunications minister, would have liked to roll out or one that he designed. But he was left a legacy—a legacy that was in shreds. In fact, he resurrected the NBN as it stood when we came to government in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To refresh the memory, in South Australia and Western Australia, the lead contractor had collapsed and virtually no work had been done. A few streets had been ripped up, and that was it. The contractor had disappeared. So it was in pretty bad form. From the outset, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the then Minister of Communications, said that the NBN would concentrate first on those areas that had the worst service. Naturally, those areas were in the country. And so it is, notwithstanding the fact that those country areas are the least lucrative for the NBN because of the subscriber numbers and the distances involved. As it stands at the moment, rural Australia is two-thirds enabled and metropolitan Australia is only one-third enabled for the NBN. Well done to him and well done to the ministers since that time who have achieved that outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the NBN rollout in Grey is 98 per cent complete. All the fixed wire componentry in Grey is  complete, and we just have a few fixed wirelesses to go, progressively over the next 18 months. The satellite, following some early teething problems, is going very well indeed. In fact, my office has not had a complaint about satellite services since November. In that time, around October or November last year, we actually doubled the size of the packages available to those on the satellite services and increased the peak data periods by about 35 per cent—all at no extra cost to the consumers. So there have been some really good outcomes. We've got a good service, and it's providing good sized packages now to businesses and individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost all of the complaints we receive now about the NBN are concerned with transference issues. Many people have issues like the provider not arriving at the designated time to complete the hook-up and the customer has taken the day off work to wait for the provider to arrive—but even those are becoming less—or the phone not working after the transfer is completed. Rarely, if ever, are they issues that are actually to do with the NBN directly; they're more to do with the providers. But these are one-off complaints, and I'm informed that, once the shutdown of the copper network is complete, the technical matters of co-existence will be removed and speeds are expected to increase on the fixed wire network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's a good news story. It's a very good news story, and inherent in the delivery is that the country gets a quality service, a comparable service to the metropolitan areas—an equitable service. That requires cross-subsidisation from the city consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation quantifies and commits to funding that cross-subsidisation. Specifically, the undervalue of the rural network—that is, the net liability—has been analysed, and the figure arrived at is $9.8 billion. In fact, this is the actual subsidy to the rural areas—as it should be. I make no bones about this. Rural people and regional businesses need the same type of access to high-speed broadband as those who live in the cities. In turn, that $9.8 billion, that annual contribution required from all customers to meet the cost of amortising this through to 2040, is $7.09 per service across the whole NBN, or across the whole fast broadband service network, for every customer that is connected. It's important that our city cousins understand the need for this fee. It's all about equality. Telecommunications is seen, quite rightly I think, as an essential service. It's a bit like water. We expect our water to be provided for the same price in the country as it costs in the city. This is one of those essential services, and it's important that we receive a comparable package right across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important that those in the country realise they are included as equal citizens of this nation and recognise the contribution the rest of the community quite rightly makes to ensure their equality in terms of telecommunications. However, for clarification on that, I might just return to the satellite service for a moment. The satellite service has cost the NBN a little over $2 billion. It's a lot of money. The decision to launch those satellites was made by the previous Labor government, and I would say that, of the entire NBN debacle they left us with, that was the finest decision they made. The launching of the two new dedicated satellites has provided that service to regional Australia, and it would not otherwise be possible. I thank Labor for that; it was a good call.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that that satellite service will eventually have 200,000 users. That works out at about $7,900 per connection. That's a lot of money. It's very expensive, but it has to be done to provide that equality. And it has to be done with satellite because the alternatives would be much more expensive. I would just ask those in my electorate who feel a little jaded that they haven't received, for instance, a fixed wire service, to remember that the satellite service cost close to $8,000 a connection and the rest of Australia is paying for it—quite rightly. In light of this debate, it's important that we in the country understand those numbers and own up to how we benefit from that contribution and commitment from across the rest of Australia to ensure that we get that equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, not every user of the fast broadband internet will use the NBN. There are some alternative services which will be operating in the city, primarily around the co-ax cable networks that exist already. If they don't pay the $7.09 per month per connection, that gives them an unfair advantage over the NBN. That is not right or proper, so this legislation will make sure those services are swept up into making that payment as well and ensures that, as an article of faith, they will compete with the NBN on an equal footing. It's a community obligation, and this legislation ensures that all people, all connections, will pay that $7.09 a month. I think it's a tidy way of dealing with the issues at hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased with the way the NBN rollout has gone in my electorate. I think I'm close to 18 months from seeing the completion of those final wireless networks—including in my home town. By and large, we have a great service out there now. There are still a lot of people to connect up. Around 50 per cent have connected to the fixed wireless network, and fewer have connected to the wireless networks. But the services are good and I think it's just a matter of time. Certainly, in the fibre-to-the-node networks, there is a final date when service will cease on the copper network. As I said, it's expected that the speeds in the network will increase. But service to the copper network will cease, so people will have an automatic transference at that stage. There are bound to be a few complaints raised again when people are staring down the barrel of a definite date. But these things need to be done. It's a good project that is providing good services, and I'm very pleased with how it's gone in my electorate. The legislation today is an essential part of ensuring its financial viability.</span>

The competition and consumer bill, the statutory infrastructure provider bill, establishes a regime in schedule 3 that will offer certainty, beyond the initial NBN rollout, that every Australian home and small business can continue to get access to a high-speed broadband connection. The statutory infrastructure provider—the SIP, if I can use the acronym—enshrines in law the obligations that are currently set out in the government's statement of expectations for the NBN. The statement of expectations requires the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians. This is a carry-through of the Labor policy to ensure that every household and every business in the country had access through fibre, through wireless or through a satellite service to the National Broadband Network. It's now a matter of history that the Prime Minister could not leave well alone. He had to satiate the desire of the former Leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister to wreck everything that Labor established, including the National Broadband Network. In part, that involved changing the model from one which would see fibre rolled out to over 93 per cent of premises throughout the country to his second-rate copper based system, which is now creating so many problems within the network—more on that in a moment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statement of expectations requires that every premises in the country has access to an NBN service, and the bill is going to put that into legislation. It's going to create a legislative requirement for that to occur. It is important now, but more important past the initial rollout phase. I see that the member for Cunningham is in the House at the moment. We share a border in the Illawarra and we share some problems, where you might have infill development or new development in areas and the NBN has already rolled through the place and people are finding it difficult to get the NBN connected to the premises in anything like a reasonable time. A provision such as this creates an obligation on the statutory infrastructure provider, which will be NBN in the majority of cases, to connect those premises on a request from a carriage service provider. The NBN was obviously established to operate as a wholesale-only, structurally separated entity so that retail competition would drive benefits to consumers. This competition would provide lower prices, more choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses, and we're already seeing that, to a large extent, across all parts of the telecommunications market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statutory infrastructure regime puts into legislation Labor's vision of universal access, which we brought forward almost a decade ago. It provides certainty to consumers, industry and stakeholders about the obligations to supply high-speed broadband beyond the rollout. Of course, there are valid arguments that this measure takes a minimal approach to ensuring the NBN project is accountable to consumer needs and expectations. In particular, it's important to note that consumer protections, such as the provision of a telephone service through the customer service guarantee, do not yet exist for broadband services, and that is a job of work that needs to continue. It is long overdue, many of us argue, and this is in urgent need of redress. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the member for Grey made his contribution, he said that he barely receives an NBN complaint in his electorate. That frankly does not stack up with the data. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman saw a surge in complaints, of over 204 per cent, in the last year. Talk to most members in this place, and they'll tell you the second or third area of complaints to their office—if not their first at some point in time, particularly in the HFC area—is NBN. We know that the complaints are outstripping the level of activation, so there are issues there that need to be resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not one who is not going to give credit where credit is due. Labor has campaigned hard on the demand to see some significant changes on that initial transition program. To some extent, the industry and the NBN have changed some of their processes, and there is improvement there, but we've got a long way to go. We know, for example, that in certain technology areas, there are significant problems. I'm mindful of those households in areas that are subject to the HFC NBN services. We have seen, in data provided by the NBN Co to the Senate estimates committee, that those services suffer 30 times as much down time as the fibre NBN—even worse than the copper NBN, which has twice as much down time because of faults and major outages. So it does pose the question of why the Prime Minister, against all good advice, when he was communications minister, pursued the multi-technology mix strategy, which has led to so many problems throughout the network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Cunningham, I represent a regional electorate where I know a large proportion of my electorate receives services that are not through fixed-line services. With the fixed-wireless service, we know that a quarter of the cells offer speeds that are below the current statement of expectations. This is a matter of concern for people in regional areas. We know that congestion is a problem for around six per cent, by our estimate, and could be affecting around 40,000 customers on 500 of the NBN's fixed-wireless cells. So we want to ensure that, as we are turning our minds to consumer protections and consumer rights, we are seeing those customers who are on the non-fixed-line network receiving the benefits that have been enshrined in statements of expectation and that the government says to the NBN should be the minimum service levels that are expected by any customer throughout the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know some of these problems are going to get worse, by the way. If the network is struggling to deliver 25 megabits per second during peak times now, we know those problems are going to get worse. The reason we know this is that Australians have a voracious appetite for data. Every 12 months the amount of data that we download as a nation increases by 40 per cent—and it's not all Netflix. Yes, there is a component of that in there, but there is a 40 per cent increase every 12 months and no sign of that slowing down anytime soon. You're a wise man, Deputy Speaker. You would have taken note of the fact that we aren't increasing the number of hours of the day by 40 per cent every 12 months, which means, if we don't have a 40 per cent increase in the amount of time to download that data, then we've got to have an increase in our capacity to download it over the same amount of time. That means we need to increase the speeds of download. It's as simple as that. It's kind of second-grade maths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on the—I won't use the word 'inferior'—less able network technologies are going to feel the brunt first. Whether they are on satellite or fixed-wireless services, on the copper or the HFC services, that's where the problems are going to be felt first. That is why it is so important that we turn our minds to consumer protections, so that we have the right pressures in the marketplace, on both the retailers and on the NBN, to ensure that people have the technology to do the job that is expected and that people are getting the service they are paying for. It's as simple as that. People should be getting the service that they are paying for. And if we want to enable our businesses, our schools and our households for the digital economy of the future—we used to talk about innovation a lot in this place; I understand it's not the flavour of the month with the government at the moment, but it's still important—we need to enable our digital economy. Clearly, we're not there yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. Brought forward in schedule 4 of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, it sets out a levy that is going to be payable on all non-NBN fixed-line services. The rationale for the levy is that regional fixed-wireless and satellite NBN services are unprofitable. We always knew that. We always knew that if we were going to go for ubiquity and see access to broadband as a citizenship right then there were going to be some areas that simply weren't going to be delivered through market forces alone. That cost is estimated, over the period between now and 2040—as the member for Grey before me mentioned—to be around $9.8 billion. It will cost the NBN Co roughly $725 million annually by 2019-20 to support these regional services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that those services are maintained. That is why Labor, with some significant reservations, is supporting this part of the legislative package—not without some concerns, and not without a belief that this is not going to be the last word on this particular issue. It is not going to be the last word on this particular issue, and we know that because only a few months ago the government, after years of urging, conceded that it had to get its skates on over a review of the universal service obligations and the customer service guarantees that are attached to those obligations. Quite simply, if a cross-subsidy arrangement exists within one part of a fixed-line network for telephony and phone box services then we've got to drag that into the 21st century. Deputy Speaker, it'll strike your constituents as somewhat crazy, as it does mine, that we have a guarantee to a phone box but not to a broadband service, but that's what the universal service obligation arrangements provide at the moment. They provide significant cross-subsidies for a phone box and a copper-line service. We need to drag that into the broadband age, and we need to look at both the universal service obligations and the cross-subsidies that are necessary for a viable, ubiquitous national broadband network as a job lot. That is why I say that this cross-subsidy charge, the subject of this bill, will not be the last word on the subject. Labor supports it with those reservations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason it's necessary, by the way, and the reason that the charge is falling upon those non-NBN fast broadband providers, is that we cannot have a viable market, cannot roll two superfast broadband networks out to the entire country, based principally on a fixed-line connection. It is simply not economically viable. We have seen that through our pay TV experience. What we can do that's economically viable is have two in an inner city area. The problem is, though, that if one of those providers has an obligation throughout the entire country and the other one only has customers in the inner city then one has a massive market advantage—it's not viable. It's why Labor took the correct decision back in 2007 to mandate the NBN as the principal fixed-line service provider and fixed-wire service provider across the network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, when he was opposition communications spokesperson, sent the wrong signals into the market, and that's, in part, why we have the problems that we're dealing with today. Some of the problems we are dealing with today are the result of his interventions back then. We have to put a levy on these to ensure that we have the revenue to cross-subsidise these provisions. With those reservations, I support the bill and the amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  In today's modern world the provision of superfast broadband is a basic necessity. It's the foundation upon which virtually all sectors of the economy depend, from education to health care, aged care to social services, agriculture to high-tech manufacturing. It is the 21st century highway that will power our economy into the future. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 will significantly improve the provision of superfast broadband across all sectors of the economy and for all users. Passage of these historic reforms will mean a more efficient telecommunications sector fostering greater competition and competitiveness. The package has three parts that all work in concert: introducing a legal guarantee that all people living in Australia will be able to access superfast broadband through the statutory infrastructure provider reforms, providing greater structural flexibility to network providers and small operators, improving competition and establishing the regional broadband scheme to secure an equitable and transparent funding mechanism to ensure the long-term viability of NBN Co's satellite and fixed wireless services for regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes a statutory infrastructure provider, or SIP, which is required to connect premises to a superfast broadband network, on reasonable request. This will require the SIP to supply wholesale services that retail service providers can then on-sell to consumers, ensuring access to superfast broadband and voice for all premises and consumers. NBN Co will be the default statutory infrastructure provider in areas as it rolls out the National Broadband Network, and for almost all of Australia once the NBN is complete. Other carriers, though, may be statutory infrastructure providers where appropriate—for example, where they have a contract to install infrastructure in a new development. The SIP regime will rectify an existing limitation in the current statement of expectations issued to NBN Co, whereby not all premises may be connected. This follows recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its review of the universal service obligation and will ensure consumer access to services through the SIP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits to consumers are significant, as there is now a statutory obligation to connect premises that may be difficult or expensive to service and to ensure these consumers are not left behind or ignored. The new rules set out baseline standards that require the SIP to provide wholesale services which support peak download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second and peak upload speeds of at least five megabits per second. Importantly for many consumers, including older Australians, this requirement includes the need to support voice on fixed line and fixed wireless networks. Significantly, the bill also provides clear targets that reflect the current statement of expectations to ensure at least 90 per cent of premises in its fixed line footprint can receive peak download speeds of at least 50 megabits per second and peak upload speeds of at least 10 megabits per second.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, NBN Co's fixed line network must be capable of being connected to at least 92 per cent of premises in Australia. Finally, the bill allows the Minister for Communications to make for service providers rules dealing with consumer issues like the handballing of disputes between wholesale and retail providers. This will provide consumers with clear information on why any reasonable request for connection has been refused and by whom, enabling them to pursue redress with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or the Australian Communications and Media Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Competition within the telecommunications market has always been somewhat of a holy grail, limited by a tight regulatory environment and natural barriers to entry. Ensuring market operators have the confidence to invest, while protecting consumers from monopolistic behaviour, is a challenge. This reform package contains significant measures to improve competition within the sector. The bill repeals part 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 to improve the flexibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to regulate certain wholesale superfast internet services to promote competition. The existing separation rules are limiting investment in alternative superfast networks while at the same time allowing other carriers to operate substantial superfast networks that aren't subject to separation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments make the default structural separation requirements clearer and more effective as a baseline for the industry. The bills will make the carrier separation rules for superfast residential networks more effective but also more flexible, giving operators of networks greater scope to invest in superfast networks and compete. Significantly, the changes mean networks servicing small businesses will no longer be subject to the separation rules, promoting competition and investment and thus encouraging entry of new networks into this market. The bill will also allow carriers to be functionally separated—that is, have both wholesale and retail businesses, subject to ACCC approval—thus promoting further investment with greater certainty for a return on investment. Finally, the bill allows the ACCC to exempt small start-up networks with up to 2,000 services from the separation rules in order to encourage entry into the market and the growth of new providers. These changes will significantly increase competition in the market by encouraging and stimulating investment by the private sector in new networks which cater to the needs of individual customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill appreciates the value of broadband services for all Australians. Accordingly, this bill establishes the regional broadband scheme, which will equitably share the cost of NBN Co's fixed wireless and satellite networks proportionally across NBN Co itself and comparable networks. It will ensure NBN Co and its competitors operate on a level playing field, each contributing to funding the fixed and wireless satellite networks in regional Australia, including asset renewal and replacement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For regional and remote communities the value of reliable broadband services is paramount. In my electorate of Mackellar is the remote community of Cottage Point, which is home to 83 adults and 54 families. It's a community that includes a rural fire brigade, a marine rescue centre, a kiosk, a boatshed, the Kuring-gai Motor Yacht Club and Seawing Airways. It's a tourist destination attracting tens of thousands of tourists every year. Yet it does not have mobile service coverage and its only internet service is via an outdated, unreliable, eight megabit per second microwave link to Berowra, routing down to ADSL services around the community. It is downright dangerous that emergency services cannot be contacted directly when phone reception drops out again. Small businesses that depend on data and voice services for everything from bookings to EFTPOS have to continually put up with an incredibly slow service which often drops out for days on end. This is a community that contributes close to $3 million into the tax system every year. They have no public transport, water, sewerage, garbage collection, access to free-to-air television—I don't know why they are complaining about that!—and no kerbs and guttering. All they ask for is basic voice and data services so that their businesses can continue to operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is evidence of the Turnbull government's continuing commitment to improving the provision of superfast broadband across metropolitan, regional, rural and remote Australia. The bill will make crucial amendments to the communications regulatory framework to ensure greater competition across both wholesale and retail sectors. By strengthening competition and improving market access for small and emerging providers, consumers are given more choice in choosing communication services that meet their needs. We on this side of the House don't believe in a one-size-fits-all approach where government decides what your needs are and how best to satisfy them. We believe that, by enabling private enterprise to take risks and provide a differentiation in market offerings, consumers are ultimately the winners because the consumer knows what's best for their family or their businesses. But where consumers' options for access to broadband services are limited due to their regional or remote location, this bill ensures they will have access, under the statutory infrastructure provider obligation, to those vital services—because we in the coalition understand that they matter irrespective of their location. I commend this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  There are so many great examples of great Labor policy that will lead the way to significant transformation that were delivered by the last Labor government—the NDIS, renewable energy targets, needs based funding for schools and, of course, the NBN. <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">A</span>nd funnily enough these great investments, this vision for a better society, have been absolutely destroyed by the Abbott and Turnbull governments. In 2009 Labor announced that it would build a $43 billion National Broadband Network to provide to all Australians universal access to high-speed broadband. This infrastructure would become the digital backbone of our economy, driving social and economic opportunities for decades to come. The original vision was to build a fibre-to-the-premises network that would extend to 93 per cent of the country, with the remaining seven per cent to be served through a competition of fixed wireless and satellite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN was established to operate as a wholesale only, structurally separated entity, enabling an environment where retail competition could thrive. This competition would provide lower prices, more choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses. But coalition governments are not visionary governments, and you couldn't get more policy paralysis than what we have witnessed with the Turnbull government. One of the greatest letdowns, dropped balls and missed opportunities that this government has delivered is the NBN. The great aspiration for high-speed broadband across the country—not just Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, but the nation—has been completely lost under the Turnbull government. Under Labor, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with optical fibre. But, under the coalition, the multi-technology mess has delivered copper into new suburbs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's biggest disaster has been the National Broadband Network—or, as I like to call it, 'no-broadband neighbours', because under the Turnbull government that is exactly what my electorate of Herbert has experienced. In many suburbs, one side of the street has access to NBN whilst the other side of the street has no access. So Townsville is full of no-broadband neighbours. No-broadband neighbours are homes that have been declared as service class 0, meaning NBN Co has made an operational decision that it would be too resource intensive or time consuming to connect particular homes to the NBN when it is rolled out in that area. These homes are left behind without certainty as the NBN moves on to the next area. Householders are not proactively informed, and they are not given a time frame identifying when they can expect to be connected. The number of no-broadband neighbours, or service class 0 premises, has now ballooned to nearly 300,000. It is estimated that one in 10 premises will go through this frustrating experience, and the total number could rise to half a million.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are examples such as local small business operator and director of 2Technical, Luke Cashion-Lozell. The toing and freeing has been ridiculous for Luke. The NBN has been connected to Luke's office since March. Even though Luke had a notice of completion from the NBN and 80 per cent of the tenants in the building are connected to NBN, he is being told he is not connected. He's reached out to multiple retail service providers, who will not help. He's reached out to NBN Co, who will not help. He's reached out to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, who also will not help. In his email Luke says, 'I find it horrifying that the NBN Co are able to operate like this, seemingly ungoverned by anyone, completely outside of the purview of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.' I agree with Luke: it is quite horrifying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the creator of the original vision for NBN and it will be Labor that will protect the NBN. I support Labor's amendment to this bill to provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect particular premises during the rollout where the company refuses to do so for operational reasons. The amendment would also require NBN Co to proactively notify households if their NBN connection is expected to be delayed for long periods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment has the potential to assist so many people in my electorate of Herbert—like Dr Paolo Morisco. Dr Morisco runs a health and wellbeing practice in North Ward, Townsville. His new medical site is located on 34 Gregory Street, North Ward. It is a beautiful new facility, with his GP practice on the ground floor and residential units on the top two stories. This building has the latest modern technology. Dr Morisco's previous local was Mitchell Street, North Ward. For those not from Townsville, it is a walking distance of around 350 metre—no more than a five-minute walk. Although Dr Morisco has the latest modern technology and a great new facility, the one thing his practice did not have was the NBN. For months and months he waited. A medical practice cannot be kept waiting. In order to ensure the best possible treatment for his patients and a quality work space for his staff, Dr Morisco set up a satellite at his previous property, which did have NBN, to connect his new practice in order to access high-speed internet. The shadow minister for regional communications, Stephen Jones, heard of Dr Morisco's plight and came to Townsville to meet with him and the staff regarding their difficulties with NBN. The shadow minister arrived in Townsville quicker than the NBN did for Dr Morisco. It is an absolute disgrace that these are the lengths that a medical practice has to go to in order to have access to NBN.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the examples don't stop there. There's the entire suburb of Jensen, where people were left without any internet or landline phone coverage. The pensioners there, most of whom do not have mobile phones, had no landline phone connection for months, which is a huge safety risk for elderly people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the sections in Douglas. Douglas, in my electorate, is largely populated by university students and health professionals. It is a growing development area also. Because ADSL is on the way out and the NBN is very slowly on the way in, there are commercial properties that are home to doctors and university students who cannot access the internet at all. How is a university student supposed to study and research for assignments with no connectivity? How is any of this supposed to be done for those living in the suburb of Douglas if they do not have NBN? Under the Turnbull government, students will have graduated before this government has delivered the NBN. Labor is fighting for our original vision of the NBN instead of the Turnbull government's copper NBN. Placing fibre with copper is the equivalent of replacing a Holden V8 ute with a horse and cart. That's the sort of backward connection the Turnbull government has delivered to Australians in regional areas, particularly in my electorate of Herbert.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN will be the Prime Minister's biggest failure. Malcolm Turnbull promised that his NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. The NBN is now projected to cost $49 billion. Malcolm Turnbull promised that every household and small business would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. He missed his target by seven million homes. Over 5.5 million homes are still waiting. Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the coalition NBN will take fibre to 17 per cent of the population. Consumer complaints are soaring, with the 2015-16 report by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reporting a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. A recent Choice survey also reported that 62 per cent of Australians are experiencing low speeds and unreliable services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the economics and business case for the copper NBN collapsed, it became clear that Malcolm Turnbull was no longer willing to defend his decisions. But none of this is the fault of NBN Co, and the finger needs to be pointed solely at the former Minister for Communications and now Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull. The horse-and-cart copper NBN, the rollout issues and the blowout costs are the fault of the Prime Minister, and he needs to be held accountable. The NBN would have been the greatest infrastructure project delivered for regional Australia. It would have opened international connections, opened business opportunities, opened communication and opened access to education for those in regional, rural and in some cases remote Australia. Because of the Prime Minister, regional Australia will now be disadvantaged, with a horse-and-cart copper NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House today and the measures in this bill provide greater certainty about these arrangements and the scope for flexibility where the ACCC has decided it is appropriate. Although these amendments will not fix the complete mess that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has created, it is a good step and a necessary step forward. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in the NBN, and it is important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field so that the value of that investment is not unfairly determined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN was designed to implement uniform wholesale pricing to ensure that wholesale access charges for broadband services in regional and rural areas are the same as those in the cities. In order to do this, NBN is underpinned by an internal cross-subsidy that uses profits from services in the cities to fund services in the regions. The obligation for NBN to provide broadband in areas that would not otherwise be commercial to service is unique to NBN and is not shared by its fixed-line broadband competitors. It is therefore appropriate that companies that are seeking to provide high-speed broadband are broadly subjected to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co, to ensure that there is complete neutrality. The level playing field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act were introduced by Labor in 2011 and applied to superfast fixed-line networks servicing residential and small-business consumers. Part 7 requires operators of such networks to make their network available to access seekers—retail providers. Part 8 requires the networks to be wholesale only—that is, structurally separated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do I support this bill, because anything that supports NBN has my vote. But let this be a warning to the Prime Minister that I will be relentless in fighting for more fibre access, relentless in fighting for a faster and quicker rollout and relentless in my support for NBN in regional and rural Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  When Labor initiated the NBN almost a decade ago, I think I would have been considered an early adopter. I could see the benefits for an outer-metropolitan and semi-rural area of high-speed broadband. I was also frustrated, as a small-business owner, by poor quality ADSL from my mountains home, and almost non-existent mobile, and had many conversations with other small-business operators about the need for a reliable, faster internet connection. At the time, I thought NBN would deliver. The statement of expectations set out by Labor required the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians. That is happening and will continue to happen. This bill does provide certainty that from 2021 it will continue as was always the intention, although I believe the change in the mix of service has been incredibly detrimental to the integrity of the network. It has, quite frankly, created inequality across my electorate of Macquarie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back and think of where we were in 2009. After more than a decade John Howard had ensured that Australia was in the broadband backwater. It was Labor that carved out the principle that every Australian should have access to modern communications infrastructure. It took those opposite many years to come to the party and sign up to this principle. In the end they had no choice because, in spite of the irresponsible claims that no-one needed fast upload and download times, businesses, students and families all realised that in fact they did. Labor is proud of having fought for and reached this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the regime as outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. The Statutory Infrastructure Provider regime will offer a natural extension of the current arrangements—the certainty that, as we move beyond the initial NBN rollout, every Australian home and small business will continue to get access to high-speed broadband connection. It is fundamentally about equality of opportunity, and it will ensure that Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live and work. But—and there is a but—there is so much more to do to make this NBN work the way it's intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about some of the local issues we face in Macquarie. The plan of works yet to be rolled out offers no equity for people in my electorate. For a start, my electorate has five different types of broadband. There is fibre to the premises, top of the line thanks to Labor, through the suburbs around Windsor and Richmond. Fibre to the node through my upper Blue Mountains towns, from Mount Victoria to Lawson, demonstrated that this has been a very poor substitute for quality, and, unbelievably, we have more FTTN to come. We have the Sky Muster satellite, we have fixed wireless—also an incredibly disappointing technology not just for the fact that it requires giant towers across rural landscapes—and shortly there will be fibre to the curb. All of them have their challenges, but I would much prefer to be dealing with some dug-up clumps of grass than the service-zero issues we're seeing with the FTTN rollout in the upper Blue Mountains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year retail service providers were called out for selling speed plans that the copper NBN couldn't deliver. And my constituents fell victim to those. Nearly one in two customers on the copper NBN who were paying for the top tier speeds had their speeds downgraded and were compensated as a result. It was later reported that one in three homes on copper can't achieve 50 megabits per second, and three out of four can't achieve 100 megabits per second. The Senate also learnt that no funding was set aside in the government's NBN business case out to 2040 to upgrade the copper footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a system being rolled out that relies on copper in so much of my electorate, but it relies on the assumption that the copper connections won't need to be upgraded for at least another 23 years. That defies logic. I get reports from constituents, based on comments that technicians have made to them, about the quality of the copper right across the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. In Bilpin, like many other upper Blue Mountains locations, the copper is old. Bilpin is geographically not far from Sydney—but it might as well be. It's got orchards and cider and is surrounded by World Heritage national park. It's subject to storms, bushfire and snow. The copper is not in great condition, and the quality of landline and ADSL is awful. There isn't a decent mobile signal in many parts of Bilpin, yet this area is only getting fixed wireless, so those landlines and that copper will still be needed, particularly in bushfires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents have raised with me a number of practical issues about the rollout of fixed wireless in their area. For a start, wireless signal requires line of sight for best results, and less than 10 per cent of households in Bilpin have line of sight to the planned tower. Both trees and hills have a huge effect on the signal, and residents have pointed out that the signal only travels around 12 kilometres with direct line of sight, so many homes are out of the line, although the map that showed this on NBN's page has apparently been removed. The signal degrades and cuts out in heavy rain, and, yes, we get heavy storms in that part of the Blue Mountains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their other big concern—and this would be a concern to anybody who has people in bushfire areas in their electorate—is that they have no battery backup for the fixed wireless towers, so they don't work in a blackout, leaving residents with no phone line. We have the same issues with FTTN, of course, yet those residents won't even have the choice to keep their fixed landline. In Bilpin, people will have a landline that they can choose to keep, but they will continue to pay their landline rental on top of their NBN. It is hardly equitable and hardly fair, especially when you consider that Bilpin has a fibre-optic cable running from Kurrajong Heights past it, all the way to Berambing, so residents are really struggling to understand why areas not dissimilar to theirs are being gifted FTTC but they are stuck with fixed wireless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A new resident to the Hawkesbury, Greg, who lives in Maraylya, in another part of my electorate, has been gobsmacked overall by the lack of service that he receives. Even though he's only moved 40 kilometres to the edge of Sydney, he describes the telecommunications conditions in Maraylya as Third World. What he's staggered at is that he's slated to get fixed wireless not this year, not next year, but in 2020. And that's as good as it will get under this government. His dismay is shared by a wide range of Maraylya residents. In fact, it's a total mess to try and guess what you're going to get if you live in Oakville, which has some parts FTTP, some parts fixed wireless, or McGrath's Hill, a major commercial centre that's getting FTTN, even though, next door, Windsor has FTTP. Wilberforce and Freemans Reach get stuck with FTTN. It is a complete hotchpotch in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The choice of cheap and poor-quality technology and the lack of vision for this rollout as we're seeing it, particularly in the Hawkesbury, stand in stark contrast to other things the community sees government doing to it—for instance, the New South Wales government's obvious desire to colonise the region with dense housing developments. Let me explain. From Oakville to Grose Wold, this is a region of small communities, with paddocks and acreage where people grow vegies, keep horses and have koalas, lyrebirds and platypus in their backyards. They make a choice to move there to enjoy the peace and quiet. Most of these areas are not considered by this government's rollout to be dense enough to deserve anything other than fixed wireless, FTTN or in some cases satellite NBN. But the New South Wales government has other ideas about what will happen in the next few decades in these areas and envisages intense development. How do I know this? Why else would they be rushing through the drawing of lines on a map for two major motorways—the M9 Orbital and the Bells Line of Road? If you didn't think there were going to be changes to the area, you wouldn't need to put these on the map for times going forward. If you think this area is going to remain relatively sparsely populated, there is no need to preserve a corridor now. Hawkesbury residents will know what I mean when I say that the state Liberals have a vision of endless Redbanks west of the Hawkesbury River. I'm happy to put on the record that I am strongly opposed to that. The city should stop at the Hawkesbury River. If that is your vision, be honest about it. It's one thing to plan for future road and rail corridors but it's another to do it with absolutely zero community consultation. If that's the vision, make sure your fellow Liberal government in Canberra knows so that decent NBN can go into the region, so infrastructure can go in ahead of populations. And if you're just using it to score political points west of the ranges for your National Party colleagues, then don't. Do not treat my community, my families, my businesses, my farmers, my schools as your plaything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An inferior NBN is symptomatic of an inconsistent vision for the Hawkesbury. On the federal government's part, it's a total lack of interest or understanding about how important and effective NBN is for this region. Quite simply, under this Prime Minister we have an NBN that is costing taxpayers $4 billion more to build than it ought. It delivers slower speeds. It is less reliable. It costs more to maintain. It is more exposed to competition from wireless. It costs more to upgrade. And it generates less revenue from those who are willing to pay. For my electorate, the slow speeds, the dropouts and the unreliable services mean that they will look to any alternative that they can find.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trying to get issues and complaints dealt with by the NBN is as difficult as getting Donald Trump to speak in understandable sentences. They pass the buck without accountability. People make appointments with technicians only to find that no-one turns up. It's no surprise that the TIO, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, revealed a shocking increase in the number of complaints about the NBN—a 160 per cent surge in NBN complaints. I confess that many will have come from the electorate of Macquarie. For the first time, NBN complaints are growing faster than the number of new NBN services. What a damning statistic. Also for the first time, internet services have become the largest source of complaints for the TIO. All the while, the Turnbull government has been an uninterested spectator on the NBN—and this from a Prime Minister who used to have some claim to being at the front of the IT game. What a sleight of hand that was. CHOICE surveys report that 60 per cent of people on NBN had issues in the last six months; 44 per cent of these issues were related to slow speeds, 42 per cent were reported disconnections, dropouts and performance issues, and 31 per cent were problems with connections. When you look at that you know you have problems that need to be solved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish with the issue that I started with, the issue of inequality. And I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of technology on inequality, which is actually really what I think the core of this debate is. The NBN was originally an opportunity to reduce inequality, but, the way it's going, it is failing at that. The most recent report by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia takes a close look at inequality, including the future relationship between technology and inequality. The report says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Technologies … increase the productivity of industries, groups and individuals to different extents, skewing the rewards of labour to those able to access and make use of the new technology …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… how do we ensure that it’s not just the well-educated, the well-connected or the wealthy that get to benefit from new technologies?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard last year, the Prime Minister, with his Point Piper home, was privileged to receive a speedy connection to the NBN and is now, apparently, able to access the highest speed possible—100 megabits per second download speed and 40 megabits per second upload speed. Greg at Maraylya and my Bilpin residents can only dream about that. So let's be blunt. If you are not giving people equal access to technology, you are not giving them a chance. Sadly, as we so often see with this government, the already privileged get more privileged and the rest just get done over. What I see across Macquarie is a completely uneven, unfair and unsustainable approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEDA report also leads me to ask yet again why this government is so bent on reducing the opportunities for people to access skills through more cuts. We saw in the budget last night more cuts to TAFE, to the tune of $270 million. Why are so many impediments put in the way of people who want to go to university? Why are limits put on universities' ability to offer new and innovative courses that give people the chance to explore new technologies, all because of funding cuts? It shows the folly of this government's intent to cut funding to schools, of which 82 per cent of the brunt will be felt by public schools. As CEDA says, the challenge is to ensure that no-one is unfairly excluded or discriminated against along the way. But that's what we're seeing with the NBN.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I thank the member Macquarie for her fantastic explanation of the issues, which affect my electorate as well. It may surprise you to know that I'm not by nature a complainer or a whinger, but on this issue it is just a farce that we have been left in this situation by a man who thinks he invented the internet. I've spoken a number of times in this chamber about the poor state of affairs that the NBN is in and how this Prime Minister has truly bungled a once-in-a-generation, once-in-a-lifetime nation-building project, but bungled it has been. Judging by the number of constituents I hear from who have issues with the NBN, I believe the Macarthur region in outer south-western Sydney is one of the worst hit areas nationwide. I shouldn't be surprised about this. State and federal Liberal-National party governments have neglected to provide infrastructure in many areas—including housing, education, health and transport—in south-west Sydney, so why should the NBN be any different? Indeed, it's no different. There is a very poor provision of services. As the member for Macquarie has explained, those who are most disadvantaged appear to be worse off, and there is very little commitment to (1) admitting there's a problem—and there clearly is—and (2) fixing it. It's clear that this government, under the stewardship of the Prime Minister, does not understand how to deliver on vital infrastructure projects. That is true across the board, but particularly so with the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke last year in this chamber about the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's report which identified many cases in south-west Sydney of constituents who had been let down by this government's second-rate NBN. I have spoken to many telecommunications engineers who tell me that this problem was completely predictable. By using a half-baked NBN relying on the old copper network in many suburbs in my electorate that are 30, 40 or 50 years old, we were never going to get adequate services, and indeed that has proved to be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been so many issues. I even held an NBN forum on two occasions in my electorate, inviting people to share their stories with our shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland. I appreciate that many people are not always available to come down to my office between nine and five, Monday to Friday, so I held the forum on a weeknight in a local community hall. Even though there had been lots of complaints, I expected maybe only 20 or 30 constituents to turn up, but in fact hundreds attended. Given that evenings in Macarthur can be very hectic for families, with kids to be fed and bathed, homework to be done, and people often getting home from work after travelling for hours, many people attended these forums and voiced their concerns in no uncertain manner about the NBN—not only the service they were receiving but also the problems they were having in making their difficulties understood by the telecommunications providers and the government in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vitriol directed towards NBN Co and the Liberal-National government is so strong within Macarthur that there are many more complaints to my office every day. People express their concerns to me after busy days at work and school, along with all the other issues that families face. To be perfectly honest, the volume of complaints my office receives has slightly slowed down in the last few months. When I inquired of long-term complainants why they had stopped complaining, many of them said that they had found the issues too difficult to deal with, and the lack of response from providers so poor, that they had given up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been instances where many small businesses have had to close or send staff home because their phone lines were down, their internet didn't work and EFTPOS services had been disrupted. As the owner of a small business in Campbelltown and Camden myself, I can assure you that such disruptions can bring businesses to a standstill, cost a lot of money and are incredibly frustrating. Currently there are even instances of local medical centres losing all phone lines and telecommunication services. It means they're unable to process Medicare claims; bulk-bill; see X-ray films and pathology results; forward patient records, which can be vital in emergencies, to other medical services, such as hospital emergency departments; and sometimes even answer the phone to book in appointments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been instances where the elderly face significant hardships at the hands of this government and NBN Co. Even in the last month it has come to my office's attention that a 95-year-old had been without a stable phone line for six months. Surely this is something that demands urgent change. This is all due to the government's poorly functioning NBN. I don't believe that this government, this Prime Minister and this communications minister understand the impact that their bungled NBN has had on many disadvantaged Australians. If they had any appreciation of the difficulties they have caused, surely they would do everything in their power to change the situation. It has all been predictable. Even now suburbs are still being connected to the NBN through what we know are very poor, terribly degraded copper phone lines. There is going to be a problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tumultuous nature of the NBN rollout under this government, and the lack of quality service provided by their second-rate NBN, has been crippling for many small businesses and people in the Macarthur electorate and has caused a great deal of distress for many families. Like the lack of proper infrastructure in many other areas—transport and health—this disadvantage is predictable, it's occurring now, and the government is doing nothing about it. I put it to you that, in this day and age, no business should have to close due to the government's inability to manage telecommunications, and no individual should be made to worry due to their inability to get hold of a family member who lives by themselves, but it's still happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's one thing for somebody in the middle of a city to be hit hard by the government's failures, but, in an area that lacks proper public transport and where many suburbs are quite isolated, this can be catastrophic. There may well be people who can't even get proper mobile phone reception in some areas of my electorate. Under the Liberal-National government, NBN Co and telecommunications companies expect people to merely get another device or find some other way to communicate, but that's not true for many in my electorate in south-west Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As outrageous as this is, at least those in built-up and metropolitan areas have an alternative. Those in remote, rural and regional areas—and even outer suburban areas like my electorate—are being made to suffer unnecessarily because of the government's lack of urgency and understanding to respond to these issues. I can only assume the coalition expects people who live in more isolated parts of the country to revert to some other way of communicating, such as smoke signals and carrier pigeons, when they're being let down by this second-rate NBN. What else is somebody who lives in a mobile phone blackspot supposed to do when their phone lines are down, they can't communicate using the NBN and they're in distress? How is a farmer whose nearest neighbour is 40 kilometres away supposed to maintain contact with the rest of the world if his phone line is down, the NBN is down, and the government can't ensure stability in telecommunications?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again we see the Liberal-National government's utter contempt for those in regional Australia and less affluent suburbs. It's truly a wonder how the coalition agreement is still intact and that the Nationals have any relevance left with their original voter base, when we consider these realities and their lack of urgency in attempting to get the Prime Minister to see the importance of these issues. The biggest joke in modern-day politics is that the Nationals believe they're standing up for regional Australia when they're doing nothing of the sort, particularly when you look at the NBN, where they can't even ensure connectivity for their constituents in their regions, yet they sit meekly by and watch the Prime Minister thumb his nose at them. Perhaps if their party were less focused on inner turmoil they would have steered the government in a better direction with the NBN. I also think that, on the recent announcements about cutbacks in the ABC—when the ABC is so important to rural and regional Australia—the National Party should surely be saying to the coalition: 'Do something about this. We need to expand the services of the ABC, expand their reach and provide them with adequate funding to deliver to rural and regional Australia.' Yet the Nationals sit there and say and do nothing. They seem to cave in to the concerns of the 'Hansons' and to the right wing of the Liberal Party, with their attacks on the ABC which are contributing to poor communications in rural and regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the second biggest joke is the fact that this Prime Minister, who made a fair bit of his fortune in telecommunications, still thinks he can flog the dead horse that is his second-rate NBN without doing anything about it. Madam Speaker, you may remember a time when the Prime Minister thought it was a good idea, under the leadership of his former boss the member for Warringah, to rip apart Labor's NBN. Apparently, there was no need to ensure that everyone had an equal service. Some would get a first-class fibre-to-the-premises connection and others would get a dodgy fibre-to-the-node connection, and that was just tough luck, because those who were getting fibre-to-the-node were mostly in rural and regional areas, in disadvantaged areas and in outer suburban areas which had no relevance to the Prime Minister because he was fine in Point Piper getting his fibre-to-the-premises NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing copper was fine, the Prime Minister believed—even though I know he was told the opposite. He was told that there were going to be problems, and yet he still persisted with his second-rate NBN. There was apparently no need to install a state-of-the-art world-class network for all because the people who mattered were going to be okay. We, on this side of the House, knew this to be a falsehood and that the coalition's second-rate service would not pass the test of time. And, indeed, it hasn't. It was not long before we uncovered the truth—and I am happy to admit I was on a very steep learning curve. The truth about the NBN is that some people are getting an excellent service, some people are getting a reasonable service and many—10, 15 or maybe even 20 per cent—are getting a terrible service or no service. Yet it was okay, according to this government and this Prime Minister, for them not to be treated as first-class citizens. The existing copper network is not sufficient. It's quite clear this is the case, and nothing has been done to change that. We will continue to have these difficult issues without it being explained appropriately to the Australian population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the Liberal National Party government do now? It doesn't replace the dodgy old lines with fibre reconnections. It has purchased more copper to service their second-rate scheme, causing continuing problems. It just beggars belief. It's not going to get better; it's going to continue. How anybody can believe that the Liberal National Party government is economically responsible when they make a move such as this is astonishing. This decision angers me, as a member of this place, as a taxpayer and as someone who feels that we are all equal in this society. It just reeks of incompetence and a lack of care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The public were assured that this government's NBN would come quicker and at a cheaper cost. Time and time and time again, we have witnessed a complete blowout in the rollout, a blowout in expenditure and a blowout in complaints. With the taxpayers being made to foot the bill to purchase more out-of-date technology, it's likely that matters will just get worse. They can't do anything to roll out infrastructure properly, and it has now become past a joke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Feeling optimistic, I am quite hopeful that eventually government will learn the lesson. It may well be too late for them—they're taking years to learn that—but maybe, eventually, they will consider the change. It will probably be too late—they won't be in government anymore. The optimism that I had initially about the NBN, with the Prime Minister's reassurance, has been crushed. I have come to the realisation now that there's not going to be any short-term move by this government to improve the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With my constituents, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that their complaints are heard and the problems can be remedied, but, for many, I can't. It would seem that the NBN Co and the government have, in fact, not been listening and are not taking any serious action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also would like to point out, as an aside, that the percentage of premises able to connect to the NBN has actually dropped since November last year—fewer people can somehow connect to the NBN—according to the NBN Co itself, because some of them will never get a proper service. It is staggering to me that this is still the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also really like to acknowledge another piece of information that I've uncovered from NBN Co itself. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are currently running our repairs with 85 per cent of NBN faults within our agreed service levels …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's still 15 per cent that is not being treated appropriately. I may be mistaken, but to me it sounds as though the NBN Co is failing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  Yesterday the Treasurer stood at the dispatch box in the House, in his usual thunderous manner, to declare that the Turnbull government is a tax cutter. Yet here we are, a day later, debating this supposedly tax-cutting government's introduction of a new tax that will cost up to 450,000 Australians an extra $84 a year. There's eight weeks worth of tax cuts gone, just like that. If we've come to understand one thing about this government, it's that they say one thing and do another—from no cuts to the ABC and health to no dollar difference for school funding. They cannot be trusted at their word.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new broadband tax is a direct result of this government's failure to properly implement the National Broadband Network. More particularly, it's this Prime Minister's failure—and it is a personal failure. He had personal carriage of this portfolio as the former communications minister, and he has had personal carriage as Prime Minister. The failure of the NBN under the Liberals can and should be laid at the feet of this Prime Minister, who promised Australians a cheaper and faster NBN. It's certainly cheaper, in the way that a Moskvitch is cheaper than a Ford. Its component parts are inferior. It's nowhere near as well designed, and it's falling apart before it's even finished. The NBN under this Prime Minister has become a cobbled-together mess, reliant on last-century copper that is incapable of delivering the services that the 21st century requires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the parliament's NBN committee, I've heard testimony from witnesses, including home owners, academics, small-business people, technicians and bureaucrats. The evidence overwhelmingly is that the NBN being rolled out by this government is already not fit for purpose and is already proving to be a serious drag on our ability to compete in the global market. At the consumer level, the Liberals' NBN is failing at even the most rudimentary level. Families can't stream movies. Kids can't do their school and uni projects. Businesses can't get reliable connections for wireless transfer payments. And, to top it all off, despite having become this sad and broken thing, the NBN is still proving to be more expensive than the Prime Minister promised, and now he has to pay for it. More to the point, he's making Australians pay for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new tax will compel broadband infrastructure providers to add $7.10 to their customers' monthly bills. You won't see any reference to this new tax in the budget papers. Because of the mysterious way that financial reporting works, it doesn't appear as that sort of revenue. There's no talk on morning shows about the new tax, which will cost Australians nearly $34 million a year. I think the shadow minister said that it will be close to half a billion dollars over 10 years. The tax will also be charged to all non-NBN consumers receiving fixed-line services capable of delivering a minimum speed of 25 megabits per seconds download. This essentially captures those receiving fibre to the node, fibre to the kerb, fibre to the basement, fibre to the premises or HFC. The government says the tax is necessary in order to guarantee the sustained rollout of broadband services throughout regional Australia, which is where I'm from. But the Prime Minister didn't say any of this before the election. This Prime Minister never told Australians he would be so utterly hopeless at his job that he planned to introduce a new tax simply to provide what is, for so many, a substandard internet experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's approach was so different. We would have provided fibre to the premises to more than 93 per cent of Australians, with Australians in small regional towns—not big regional towns but small regional towns—and isolated properties to receive either fixed wireless or satellite services. And we would have done it without charging homeowners thousands of dollars more for a fibre to the premises connection, and we would have done it without imposing this tax, because Labor believes in the principle of a universal right to broadband access. We know that connection to the internet is as necessary to modern life as the telephone was 100 years ago. It is not a luxury that should be provided only to those who can afford it or in areas where someone can make money from it; it is a service all Australians deserve, no matter where they live, and it should have been done without this tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is not opposing this measure. We don't like it—and we wouldn't have done it, because we would have funded national broadband properly—but, because of this government's incompetence, regional Australians risk being left behind without this revenue measure. Already people in regional electorates like mine are missing out on broadband, even with the NBN supposedly rolling through their communities. The government boasts about the speed of its rollout. It's like boasting about rolling out a new highway with the potholes already built in. Hundreds of properties are being left behind during the rollout, like pimples on a face, and not being connected, because they are deemed too difficult or unserviceable. This is happening in places like Dodges Ferry and Brighton, which are technically regional but are less than 40 kilometres from Hobart's CBD. These are fast-growing communities that deserve better broadband. Homeowners are being told they can't get connected, but their neighbours can. They're not given any indication about when NBN will be back. For some the wait has already been months and could drag on for years. Meanwhile these folk either have to put up with the old ADSL, if it's there, or stump up for mobile data, assuming their mobile coverage is adequate. These people are victims of this government's obsession with spin over substance. It's more interested in the speed of the rollout than the quality of the rollout.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Shaun, for example, a network engineer who lives in Pontville, within the Brighton Council. Pontville is a compact town less than 40 kilometres from the Hobart CBD and less than five kilometres from the thriving and quickly growing centre of Brighton. Shaun first contacted me in August last year. NBN Co would have you believe its rollout for Shaun's area is completed, but it's not. There are four streets with no connection, including Shaun's home. The infrastructure is in place, but NBN Co advises there will be no connection to the area at Shaun's property until later this year, nearly a year since he first got in touch. NBN Co could have connected Shaun and his neighbours, but that may have slowed down their rollout to easier addresses and interfered with the government's agenda for a good news headline. NBN Co is under pressure from this government to connect 90 per cent of properties to the NBN in every area where the rollout is occurring—but too bad if you're in the expendable 10 per cent! I've had almost continuous contact with NBN Co about Shaun's issue, and the conversation does not change. Apart from saying it is meeting its 90 per cent connection target, it refuses to concede any other point.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we travel further into my electorate, to the Central Highlands community of Miena, we can see even more evidence of the appalling infrastructure that is being rolled out by this government. Miena is remote. It has a static population of around 60 people, which swells to thousands during summer and over long weekends, when shack owners and tourists flock to the area. The current fixed wireless NBN in Miena is pretty ordinary, and the area is prone to blackouts, which is not great when you're surrounded by bush which is prone to fire, and your new NBN service means that when the power goes out so does your phone. It's usually the case that when the NBN rolls through they turn off your old phone, but what's little known is that in fixed wireless and satellite areas you can ask for your old phone to stay on, connected to the exchange. Margaret in my office discovered this and relayed that to the people of Miena, and you could hear from hundreds of kilometres away the sighs of relief that they could access their phones when the power was out. I must give a shout-out here to NBN Co's man in Tasmania, Russell Kelly, and to Telstra, who both acted quickly and cooperatively to ensure that the people of Miena did get to keep their phone connections with a minimum of fuss.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further north in Lyons—it's a big electorate: 30,000 square kilometres—in the township of Westbury, another of my constituents, Graeme, was advised by NBN Co that he could connect to the network, and, acting on this advice, he signed up to receive the NBN.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I rise this evening to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, cognate with the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. I rise with an intent to express my concerns regarding the contents of both of these bills. From the outset, I want to express my deep frustration with the current state of the National Broadband Network. When I say 'current state', I mean the state of the National Broadband Network since this government took office. Put simply, under the Abbott and Turnbull governments we have an inferior NBN that is slow and expensive—and these bills do not address these shortfalls So, while I'm pleased to join my colleagues here to speak on these bills, I think we have to have real clarity about where we are on the NBN and the need for both these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of creating a network that would become the digital backbone of our economy and drive social and economic opportunity, as Labor's proposal would have done, Australia is now stuck with a failed job—an internet network that doesn't seem to be able to connect for all Australians. Successive coalition governments have ruined, destroyed, Labor's vision for a world-class broadband system and they've imposed a 19th century, backward-looking model which relies on copper or a hotchpotch of technologies that is more expensive and does not, for a lot of Australians, work. The then communications minister, the member for Wentworth, promised Australians that his NBN would be delivered for $29.9 billion. It is now projected to cost $49 billion, and in these bills tonight we see a cost being passed on to customers. So what we now have is a broadband system that is in a state of disrepair and has blown its own budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do these two bills do? The first provides certainty that all premises in Australia will continue to access high-speed broadband infrastructure beyond the NBN rollout. This will enable Labor's initial vision for universal access to stay somewhere on the horizon. Our support for this bill speaks to us not giving up on that vision, on that equity of access that we hold so dear. The other introduces a levy of $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks, significantly regional communities. Labor will not be opposing this bill; however, I do have some major concerns about these bills and the way they unfairly target Australians who live in regional or rural areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to speak of the failure of the member for Wentworth, both as minister for telecommunications and as the Prime Minister. As the former telecommunications minister, the member for Wentworth promised Australians that every household and small business could have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. Well, check your watches—it's now May 2018. We've watched budgets come and go and we're here again for another budget and a large proportion of people living in my electorate and residents living around the country are still eagerly awaiting any internet connection, whether that be ADSL, or NBN, and whether that be wireless or satellite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community is one of Australia's largest growth areas. There are homes being built and their owners are stranded without any internet access. There are businesses still waiting. There are businesses in my electorate running sophisticated logistic software who are paying top dollar for wireless access with no relief in sight. The Prime Minister's second-rate internet would be a dream for many residents who have moved into brand new homes and are forced to wait for months to be connected to even the most basic of internet services. In this regard, the statutory infrastructure provider regime will offer a degree of certainty or hope as we move beyond the initial rollout. But what we must remember is that it was Labor who was behind the principle that every Australian should have access to modern communications infrastructure. It was not the Liberals. It was not the Nationals. In essence, I'm convinced they don't believe in universal access or digital technology, because we're in the situation we find ourselves in now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will share with the Chamber the story of a local resident. We hear regularly from our local residents who cannot access the internet in their homes. We hear horror story after horror story. I'll share tonight the story of Sandeep Singh, one of many local residents who have contacted my office. He told the story of how he had moved into his home over 11 months ago and yet still had no internet connection to his home. He explained that there are no ports available for ADSL1 or ADSL2 in the area, so he is unable to connect to even the most basic access. The NBN rollout is not expected in the area where he's purchased his home until 2019, and this has very real consequences for Mr Singh, who is forced to make do with using expensive mobile data as a substitute. I don't have to explain to Australian families living without access to the NBN what that means. It means no access for kids' homework. It means no uploads or downloads for work. It means all trying to work off one little phone. That's what it means in reality in my community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of an example of unaffordable costs, Mr Singh is currently on a mobile phone plan that provides 28 gigabytes of data per month at a cost of $85. Further to the financial costs, which are eating into the family budget, he and his family are unable to enjoy the advantages of having a normal internet service, something that very fortunate people—those who got Labor's initial NBN—have. If he goes to dinner at their houses, he's in for a shock. This is not good enough. We know 28 gigabytes doesn't go far on a mobile device, particularly if it's servicing an entire family. The government's NBN is a mess, and consumers like Mr Singh are being made to suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the 21st century, in a world where everything is online. And, when I say 'everything', I mean everything. You can't access government support without going online. You can't apply for a job without going online. And more and more of our life is going online as we speak. So this is a real equity issue. The NBN that this government is attempting to deliver is second rate, slower and more expensive than what was promised. This government NBN is a travesty. It is people like Mr Singh and the hundreds of others in my electorate who have shared their pain about life without high-speed internet who have driven me and all my Labor colleagues to fight for Labor's initial vision of universal access. The digital divide in my community is alive and well, and it is faced both by families and by businesses. This drives us to pursue universal access. This is why we support the statutory infrastructure provider scheme—because it will keep that hope alive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area that's been fairly criticised of late is the $82. We will support that, but we want it known that it is a failure of the government that it needs to be put in place in the first place.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms RYAN:</span>
                    </a>  Let's go for eight. I've got lots to say. An area that's been getting a lot of coverage lately has been the number of complaints about the NBN, and not just the complaints to members' offices. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman has reported that complaints have increased by 168 per cent. To put that into perspective, that is four times the level of complaints about the finance and banking industry, about which, through the royal commission, obviously, we're hearing disturbing stories of rorts and rip-offs—four times the number of complaints about the banking and finance sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is more concerning about this bill in particular is that a high proportion of these complaints are coming from regional Australia. In terms of the second bill, residents in regional Australia, who are already experiencing an unsatisfactory service, will be hit with this new levy. This is just unfair. The Prime Minister and his government are responsible for this mess, and now Australians are being forced to suffer. Regional Australians are paying for it through a lack of service, as reflected in the complaints, and now through an $84 a year cost to those families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A CHOICE survey reported that 60 per cent of people on the NBN had issues in the last six months; 44 per cent of these issues were related to very slow speeds and 31 per cent mentioned problems connecting to the NBN. This is alarming. Yet we don't seem to see the coalition doing anything productive about the issues that they have created. We have consumers, such as Mr Singh, with no internet for nearly a year, while the coalition continues to sing the praises of their copper failure. It is just not good enough from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regional Broadband Scheme levy is what we're looking to introduce in this bill this evening. Schedule 4 of the bill proposes the introduction of the NBN levy. It is no surprise that in the week of the federal budget the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new tax—a broadband tax this time! I am reminded, at my age, of what we used to call the television licence but, this time, only people in regional areas will pay their telecommunications licence. The levy is designed to extend high-speed broadband to unprofitable areas which, under Labor, would have been funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. As the member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, said: 'This levy is expected to add $84 to the annual broadband bill for homes and businesses of non-NBN networks.' Schedule 4 of the bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax, really, of $7.10 per month that would apply to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 per month by 2021. The fact of the matter is: this levy is a direct consequence of the repeated failures of this government. Extending high-speed broadband to remote and regional Australia was in Labor's initial plan, and this government has failed to deliver it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands that extending this infrastructure to unprofitable areas would require a universal wholesale pricing regime. This would mean that the NBN users in the city would help to cross-subsidise higher cost services in the regions. But this bill seeks to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with the new tax—a tax that will hit people living in regional and remote Australia. So I join the member for Greenway in calling on the Prime Minister to explain why the government is so adamant on giving the top end of town an $80 billion handout in the form of tax cuts while introducing an $84 annual fee to regional Australians for their access on non-NBN networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reflects this government's lax work on the NBN. It reflects their mismanagement of the processes. It means that this government is passing on the cost to regional consumers rather than fixing the funding issues themselves. This cost is the responsibility of this government. Labor will support the bill but remind the House that this is a sorry tale for which the member for Wentworth, as minister and as Prime Minister, is wholly responsible.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I also rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 in conjunction with the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. I do support the amendments moved by the member for Greenway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My focus is very much upon regional Australia. It was very disappointing that last night in the budget there was no provision to improve NBN services for those thousands of people in regional Australia who are stuck on this government's second-rate NBN. As I often say in this place, National Party choices hurt, and the one thing that really does hurt them is the absolute debacle that is the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll have a bit of a look at the history of the NBN first. In 2009, we announced our vision for a national broadband network to provide all Australians with access to high-speed internet. This great revolution, digital infrastructure, would lay the groundwork for universal economic and social opportunity into the future. Of course, it would be achieved by building an ultra-fast fibre-to-the-premises network reaching 93 per cent of Australians, with the remainder to be covered through a mix of fixed wireless and satellite. The NBN was envisaged as a wholesale-only entity, tasked with establishing this network whilst remaining structurally separate from the retail providers. This would ensure more choices and lower prices by allowing competition to thrive whilst also guaranteeing that rural and regional areas were not left behind. This is not what the government has followed through with at all. In fact, it is a quite a debacle, and I'll detail some of that later on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do support the statutory infrastructure provider regime contained in this bill, as it represents a step towards the policy vision that we established almost a decade ago. This regime will codify universal broadband access into legislation and provide long-term certainty to regional consumers and stakeholders about obligations for the supply of broadband into the future. For similar reasons, Labor supports the amendments to the level-playing-field rule introduced by this bill. This rule was also part of our original policy vision, being introduced by us in 2011. It is aimed at ensuring that there's a level playing field with respect to competition in the fixed-line telecommunications market. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in the NBN, and it's important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field so that the value of this investment is not unfairly undermined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN was designed to implement uniform wholesale pricing between regional areas and cities to ensure wholesale access prices remain consistent across Australia. This is achieved through an internal cross-subsidy which uses profits from services in the city to fund those of the regions. This unique obligation to provide services in areas that may not be commercially viable distinguishes the NBN from the fixed-line broadband competitors. As a result, to ensure competitive neutrality, it is only fair that other companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The level-playing-field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the act were introduced by Labor and apply to superfast fixed-line networks servicing residential and small business customers. Part 7 requires operators of such networks to make their network available to access seekers—retail providers. Part 8 requires networks to be wholesale—that is, structurally separate. This bill introduces amendments to provide greater certainty about these arrangements and the scope for flexibility where the ACCC decides that that is appropriate. So Labor support the measures in this bill, as they represent a realisation of our policy vision for the NBN. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, these measures are really only a drop in the bucket when compared to the shambles that the Turnbull government has made of the NBN rollout—shambles that the government now wants consumers to pay for with its internet tax. Make no mistake: this is a Prime Minister's internet tax. He owns it, and it has come about due to his cost blowouts and incompetence. This new internet tax appears in schedule 4 of the bill. It proposes to apply a tax of $7.10 per month to services on the non-NBN network. This will increase to $7.80 by 2021. This new tax will add around $84 to the total of annual bills for up to 400,000 residential and business services on non-NBN networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we have after five years of the Abbott-Turnbull government when it comes to the NBN? We have a project blowout of $20 billion and a second-rate NBN that is very slow, and now we've got a nice new big tax on top of that. What we have is a government that's totally out of touch, a government that gives an $80 billion tax cut to big business and banks and now wants to tax the use of the internet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not where the shambles end. Under Labor's plan, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with modern optical fibre. In contrast, the current government's multi-technology mess will see Australia stuck in the past, with slow outdated copper wires being installed in new homes. This means that around 8,000 newly built premises per year will be compromised by old and outdated internet speeds instead of optic fibre. Unfortunately, the bill does nothing to address this issue. Copper wire will continue to be rolled out in new suburbs. It isn't good enough and people are extremely angry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear about this all the time from locals. For example, Garry Richmond from Terranora agreed to me sharing his story—a story which is, sadly, too common. He was promised the NBN would solve the issues he was experiencing with his old ADSL2 connection; however, when the NBN was in introduced in his area in 2017, he was contacted and told that he, unlike his neighbours, would miss out. The NBN informed him that this was because copper was unable to carry the signal the required distance. However, to Garry's dismay, his neighbour's premises, over 100 metres further from the node, received an NBN connection without any trouble. He reported that this internet lottery continued throughout his local area, with many missing out, seemingly at random.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inequity can be seen all over the North Coast. In fact, in Ballina, in my electorate, plans released by NBN Co have revealed that half the residents will be getting the superior fibre-to-the-curb technology while the rest will be stuck with the slower fibre to the node. When confronted by outraged local residents and councillors, NBN Co just threw up their hands and said that it was all just too hard and they simply couldn't modify their plans, because it just didn't suit and they couldn't do that within Ballina. However, they helpfully suggested that residents just pay for it themselves if they weren't happy with having slower speeds than their neighbours. How outrageous! It is unfair. Why should some people have to pay for what others are getting for free? We are seeing this arbitrary internet rollout right across the North Coast. It simply isn't good enough and the people of Ballina are quite rightly enraged by this situation. It is indeed a far cry from Labor's vision of the NBN delivering fast and reliable internet to every Australian, with a universal and future-proof fibre-to-the-premises standard. It is clear that this bill does nothing to address issues such as the one in areas like Ballina that I highlighted. This bill does nothing to address that issue. It does nothing to address this major concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is indeed a lack of transparency and accountability for consumers and businesses who have been left behind by the NBN and potentially declared service class zero. This situation occurs when an operational decision is made by NBN Co that it would be too time consuming or resource intensive to connect a particular home to the NBN. This leaves the premises behind, without certainty, as the rollout just moves on to the next area. The consumers are not proactively informed, nor are they given a time frame in which they can expect to be connected. This is no minor issue. In fact, the number of service class zero premises has ballooned to nearly 300,000. It's estimated that one in 10 premises will go through this frustrating experience, and the total number could rise to half a million, which is outrageous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also heard of many instances where schools and businesses have been impacted. If special circumstances warrant NBN prioritising the connection of a service class zero premises such as a school or hospital, the government should have the ability to direct NBN Co to treat that connection with priority. Where there is a shortcoming in identifying a priority connection, Labor has introduced an amendment to provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect a particular premises when the company refuses to do so. That's vitally important to ensure that connection is happening in those areas. This is because we recognise that some issues just cannot be left unaddressed, and consumers do need to be treated better. That's currently not happening. The amendment would also require NBN Co to proactively inform households if their NBN connection is likely to be delayed for long periods. This would make sure people like Garry from Terranora, in the story I spoke about recently, at least informed when the NBN is unable to connect their premises, rather than forcing them to waste their time and energy chasing information they should already have. It is so frustrating for consumers when this happens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this bill does represent some steps forward for the NBN, and we do acknowledge that, it does little to fix the broader issues that the coalition government have created—the absolute mess they've created. First of all, we've had major cost blowouts. We need to focus on that. The Prime Minister had promised that his NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. Instead, the NBN's cost has blown out to $49 billion—$6 billion more than Labor's original fibre-to-the-node plan that we put forward. What do we get for this massive budget blowout? What have we got for this government's blowout? We see fibre delivered to a mere 17 per cent of Australians as opposed to 93 per cent of the population dictated under Labor's original plan—a huge difference. We see consumer complaints going through the roof, with the 2015-16 report by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reporting a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. That is a huge increase. We see 62 per cent of consumers reporting slow speeds and unreliable services. Essentially, we have a system that is costing more and doing less. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just consumers that aren't happy. The internet service providers are also up in arms about this nonsensical multitechnology mix. Nicholas Demos, the Managing Director of MyRepublic, contends, 'It's criminal what Australians have been offered in terms of speed.' And indeed it is. He does have a point. The Turnbull government's multitechnology mess means you have a technology that offers speeds of 50 megabits per second while your neighbour has a fibre connection that clocks in 100 megabits per second. The difference is outrageous. Just down the road in Terranora you have a consumer like Garry, who the NBN Co hasn't been able to deliver a basic connection to. How is it fair to have all those different standards there? It's an even greater slap in the face when you consider that providers like Google Fiber are already beginning to roll out gigabit speed internet in the US. Currently, for US$70 you can receive a thousand megabit internet speeds in select US cities. By comparison, in Australia, our average internet is 25.88 megabits per second—55th in the world behind Kenya and Kazakhstan. What if you wanted gigabit speeds in Australia? In Launceston, Australia's first gigabit city, the same service will set you back approximately a thousand dollars a month, courtesy of the NBN Co's wholesale pricing—just outrageous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government that's created a complete NBN mess right across the board. It is particularly obvious when you look to regional Australia. It is in regional Australia where we do, I quite proudly say, desperately need to have high-speed, effective internet services, for a whole range of reasons. We have our small businesses that need it to be able to connect to the world, we need it for our students, we need it in our schools and we need it in our universities. In areas like mine on the far north coast of New South Wales, we have a lot of creative industries flourishing, and of course they need a reliable and fast internet to be able to provide their services nationwide and to the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, throughout Australia we need to have fast and effective NBN services, but the regions desperately need them. We especially need them for our students. They have a right to access those fast speeds and services. I think it's been one of the great failings of this government that they've failed to provide for the regions. And, as I said, National Party choices hurt. They hurt across the regions for a lot of reasons. They certainly hurt when the National Party prioritises the $80 billion in tax cuts for multinationals, big business and banks, yet they do nothing to improve the NBN services in the country. And that's something I hear about every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, in Labor, will continue to fight for our vision of NBN and what it should be. We have suggested and put forward our amendments in relation to this. We know how good it should be, because we designed and built the initial NBN. We know what we want, and we won't settle for the second-rate NBN services that this government has been putting forward. Indeed, their costs are blowing out, their service is getting worse—it just seems to lurch from one debacle to another. As I said, in places like Ballina, it has caused a huge amount of distress. There they are, being provided with totally different circumstances, creating a massive degree of uncertainty and anger within the community. This is wholly and solely the government's doing, and there's no capacity at all to resolve it. We want to see that change. We want to see the services improve. We want to see greater transparency. People are not being told exactly what the services are that they can access. It is unfair, and it is particularly unfair for those of us in the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appeal to the government to look closely at regional Australia and the requirements that we have. It's disappointing—well, there were many disappointing things in the budget that we could run through, but, when talking about the NBN, one of those is the lack of any sort of investment in last night's budget that would improve those services for regional Australia. It is very desperate, and it is only that Labor had the true vision for it, and under this government we've just seen a blowout and a lack of services. So I certainly support Labor's amendments. I think they will go some way to getting some improvements, but we would like to see the government approach this and actually start fixing the NBN so that people can access these services.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I've spoken many, many times in this chamber about the experiences of my wonderful community here in Canberra with the rollout of the National Broadband Network under this government. I've shown that for many, particularly in the south-east corner of the electorate of Canberra—in Tuggeranong, Theodore, Calwell, Richardson and Macarthur—high-speed broadband is a pipedream, whether it's under an existing telecommunications provider or under the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Canberrans, the rollout of the NBN means that nothing will change. The majority of homes will continue to rely on unreliable, second-rate copper. The slow speeds that I've spoken about so many times in this chamber and in the House—that I've demonstrated time and again—will continue unabated. That is my major concern. These changes will not make anything better, because we will continue to rely on unreliable second-rate copper. Between 15 and 20 kilometres from this very Parliament House, in the nation's capital, in 2018, there are constituents of mine, members of my community, who are getting less than one megabit per second upload and download speeds. Less than one megabit per second—what does that actually mean? Apart from the fact that getting on the internet is an extremely excruciating and frustrating, tear-your-hair-out experience, it also means that members of my community, particularly in that south-east area of Tuggeranong, cannot do their homework from home. I have members of my community who have to go to their friend's house in another part of the electorate, or across the lake, to be able to do their homework. I have members in my community who can't set up and operate small businesses from home, because their internet service is so appalling. They have to go to the expense of hiring office space throughout Canberra to be able to get a decent internet connection so they can run a business. I have members of my community who have to stand on their garage roof to get reception. We're coming into an interesting cool patch; I think winter has finally arrived in the nation's capital. We have had a lovely kind of Indian summer, one would say, here in the last few weeks, but I think that, come tomorrow—and particularly on Friday, where we'll get a low of six and a top of seven—things are going to be interesting for that poor person standing on the roof of her garage trying to get internet connection.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who are financially strapped and can't afford to participate in the NBN's technology choice program are going to have to foot the bill to have the copper line to their house checked out, or to have the wiring in their house looked over or reconfigured. Goodbye to any personal income tax relief that this government is promising, particularly with recommendations like this!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It beggars belief, but there has been no acknowledgement of this from the other side. Hardly any of my colleagues on the other side have spoken about the actual experiences of people in their communities dealing with the NBN, other telecommunications providers, second-rate unreliable copper, and frustration with the rollout. Much of Canberra wasn't even on the rollout map until this time last year. When we finally got on the rollout map—hurrah! We were so much looking forward to it—we just kept getting moved to the right. The rollout that was meant to start this year has been moved to next year. The rollout that was meant to start last year has been moved into 2020. It is a case of 'be careful what you wish for'. There has been not a peep from my colleagues on the other side of the chamber about the experiences of people in their communities. How many people in their communities are in the same position as mine? I would say thousands, if not tens of thousands. I cannot believe that it has all been happy days for their constituents. Many Canberrans feel nothing but despair with the current rollout, the lack of transparency, the continued delays and the non-answers to questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's for these reasons that I welcome the opportunity to speak about these two bills, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, and support Labor's proposed amendment. These bills work in conjunction with each other to set the scene for Australia's broadband future. Together the bills provide legislative certainty that all premises in Australia can access high-speed broadband infrastructure beyond the current NBN rollout. The current telecommunications regulatory framework established the USO, which ensured all Australians had access to a standard telephone service; yet, as technology evolves, more and more people are shifting away from having standard telephone services in their homes. How many people do you know who still use their landline? This means that the relevance of the USO is decreasing and something needs to be done to recognise the increasing reliance of Australians on internet connectivity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor recognised this when it first designed its NBN policy, and the competition and consumer bill goes further and establishes a statutory infrastructure provider regime. It will ensure all Australian premises are guaranteed access to high-speed broadband through either NBN Co or an alternative infrastructure provider. The effect of this legislative change is that it will give certainty to customers about obligations for the supply of broadband beyond the initial NBN rollout. It is a level of certainty that consumers would have had with the original NBN rollout under Labor but were sorely missing until now. The bill enshrines in legislation a universal right to broadband access, a principle established by Labor when the NBN was first announced, a universal right that's been eroded over time by this government's inept management of the NBN rollout. It's taken those opposite many years to come to the party and to sign up to this principle, but in the end they had no choice. The Australian public gave them no choice. Labor is proud of having fought for this and proud of having reached this point. This is fundamentally about equality of opportunity in the digital age. It will ensure Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live or work. But there remains much more to do. The certainty will need to be paid for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of this bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax of $7.10 per month to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 by 2021. These bills also introduce a telecommunications levy that will add $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks. It's telling that in the week of the federal budget the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new broadband tax that is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009 the then Labor government decided to build an NBN that would extend universal coverage of broadband to regional and remote Australia, funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. This meant that NBN users in the cities would help cross-subsidise high-cost services in the regions. There was no contemplation of having a universal wholesale pricing regime and a levy. It was one or the other, not both. Yet now the government wants to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with a new internet charge. So I ask: what has changed? The cost of fixed wireless and the satellite network has not changed. The cost is effectively what was forecast. The key change has been the abandonment of fibre on the pretext that Australia would get a much cheaper, albeit inferior, multi-technology mix. But, as we know, we haven't got that. We have a more expensive $49 billion multi-technology mix that costs more and does less. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inferior multi-technology mix, according to NBN Co's own analysis, will cost $200 million per annum in steady state to maintain and operate, and generate $300 million less per annum in revenue relative to a fibre-to-the-premises network. That is a $500 million earnings gap. The copper NBN looks increasingly exposed to competition from 5G. This levy is the Prime Minister's internet tax. He owns it. It's come about as a result of his cost blowouts. It's come about because in 2013 he encouraged other companies to deploy networks and to compete directly against the NBN, with full knowledge that this would undercut the NBN business model. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In seeking to undermine the NBN business model, the Prime Minister was letting down regional Australia. He put his own interests above the public interest. Let this be a lesson for the Prime Minister. Again, be careful what you wish for. The irony is the Prime Minister now wants to tax Australians who are on these competing networks, networks he once encouraged. It is for the Prime Minister to explain why people on NBN fibre networks will eventually have to pay for his poor judgement and his failure in policy areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This levy will impact people in Canberra. It will impact people who are on iiNet's VDSL network. Labor believe that this levy is regrettable but we won't be opposing it outright. We are where we are, and ultimately it is the Prime Minister who owns this levy. It is his government that has left the economics of the NBN in a difficult state. Evidence about the NBN is in. Complaints to the TIO have increased by 160 per cent. That is four times the level of complaints about the finance and banking industry. The decision to use mainly copper technology for the fixed-line NBN being rolled out means a second-rate service. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2017 the New South Wales Business Chamber published a survey of small business experiences. Small businesses reported that switching to the NBN was costing them an average of $9,000—this is small business—through delays, disruptions and loss of sales. Of great concern, 43 per cent of the 850 businesses surveyed by the New South Wales Business Chamber reported either being dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the NBN. This is nearly three times the 15 per cent dissatisfaction rate claimed by the government. They're claiming 15 per cent, yet it's 43 per cent. A spokesman said that the Business Chamber was 'stunned by the responses'. This comes on the back of COSBOA saying:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  Labor created the NBN. Labor put forward a visionary plan to make sure that Australia could come into the 21st century—commence the 21st century, really—with a proper broadband network that would provide the high-speed internet connectivity across our entire country that Australians deserved and required to be able to participate in the global economy and the global information superhighway, as we used to call it in the 1990s. But, unfortunately, under the period of this government we've seen that plan ripped up, destroyed, mangled, bastardised and changed, such that it is now almost completely unrecognisable from that which Labor put forward so many years ago. That is really quite sad, because it could have been so good. But instead it has been terrible—quite frankly, terrible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is something to be said for these bills, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, and the need for them. The bills are intended to promote competition, to improve access to broadband services for all Australians—especially those in regional, rural and remote areas. This will be done through a few key measures. There will be the introduction of a funding mechanism for regional broadband services, which will help underwrite the costs of NBN Co providing broadband services into regional areas, particularly through fixed wireless and satellite networks. There will be the introduction of a statutory infrastructure provider regime and amendments to the super-fast network rules to clarify the wholesale-only rules applying to high-speed broadband networks. This is because the NBN was established as a wholesale-only structure. It was separated from the retailers so that we could have competition over the top of the wholesale broadband network. It's interesting to think back. If the Howard government hadn't gone on to sell the network that stood behind Telstra, in the first place, we wouldn't have had to create a whole new network to try and ensure that Australians have a broadband network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned at the outset, Labor's plan for the NBN in 2009 was designed to provide all Australians with access to high-speed broadband across the country. It would have seen 93 per cent of Australian homes having access to fibre to the premises, the superior NBN technology. The remainder would have had combined fixed wireless and satellite. This technology had the power to drive innovation, commerce and connectivity. In fact, it had the power to drive the things that we haven't even thought of today. What we have consistently heard from this government is how NBN will provide, under the government's plans, a sufficiency of connectivity and speeds to deliver on four people watching Netflix. That's great. But four people won't be watching Netflix in 20 years time. If you think about the longevity of the copper network that we've had up to this point, it seems a bit crazy to design a network that will only provide connectivity for now as opposed to 50 years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, this bill will introduce a new statutory infrastructure provider regime, which will provide industry and consumers with certainty that all premises in Australia will have access to infrastructure that supports the delivery of these super-fast broadband services. The arrangements will require NBN Co to connect premises to its network and supply the wholesale broadband services of phone and internet services. During the rollout of NBN, NBN Co will have these obligations in all areas where it's supplying carriage services. After the rollout is complete, NBN will become the default statutory infrastructure provider. In some new developments it may be the case that other carriers will be able to fulfil this role—for example, where a carrier is the sole provider of infrastructure in a new development. The obligation also provides wholesale access to broadband infrastructure for retail service providers so they can service their retail customers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In good news for consumers, one primary obligation of the SIP will be to offer a wholesale broadband service supporting peak speeds of at least 25 megabits download and five megabits upload, regardless of location. This will ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live, will be able to order a high-speed broadband service. The SIPs must also supply wholesale services to retail providers that can be used to support voice calls on fixed line and fixed wireless. This is a welcome development for consumers, industries and all stakeholders in this area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to turn my attention to the service class 0 issue. Under Labor, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with optical fibre. Yet under the coalition the multitechnology mess has seen the NBN become one of the largest global buyers of copper wire in the world, using an outdated technology and one that is becoming more and more expensive to use. This bill does nothing to reduce the chaos of the coalition's NBN network rollout, and it does nothing to address the lack of transparency and accountability for consumers and businesses who find themselves declared a service class 0. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of my constituents will be aware of this term. It's when your area comes into the NBN, like a large section of the electorate of Burt, but, for whatever reason—usually poor copper-wire service connections or being slightly too far from the pit or some other part of the network design—a premises is unable to connect to the network. You usually don't know that you are a service-class-0 home or business until your ADSL connection has been switched off and you have made multiple attempts to get your home connected. This is because, of course, according to all of the maps that you might look at, you should be in an area that can be connected to the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NBN Co and the providers are rarely able to tell these residents when this situation will be resolved. Service class 0 premises comes into existence when NBN Co has unilaterally made an operational decision that it would too resource intensive or time consuming to connect a particular home to the NBN when the NBN is rolled out in that area. The occupier of the premises, whether they be a home or a business, are left behind without certainty as the NBN moves on to its rollout in the next area. The consumer is not proactively informed; nor are they given a time frame in which they can expect to be connected. This leaves consumers angry and confused about the complete lack of transparency or any certainty. The number of service class 0 premises has now exploded to nearly 300,000 homes and businesses. It is estimated that this number may go as high as half-a-million premises, meaning roughly one in 10 consumers will be affected. These consumers include homes, businesses, churches, not-for-profit organisations and schools—all at a time when we're trying to promote STEM education and the use of technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to take a transparent and responsible approach to this. Labor has introduced an amendment that would provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect particular premises during rollout where the company refuses to do so for these operational reasons. It would require them to proactively notify households if their connection is expected to be delayed for long periods. This is something that the government really should have done long ago. It is completely unfair that the government leaves these people stranded without any hope of connection, or waiting an indefinite period of time. I've had constituents approach me and my office about this very issue, saying that they have bought in an area that is on the NBN Co map and are looking forward to getting the NBN, because it is rolled out in that area of my electorate of Burt. They are setting up a small home business and then finding, lo and behold, that the NBN actually stops about 200 metres from their home on that street. Thanks very much; that's really helpful, government! In 2013 Malcolm Turnbull said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We will complete the NBN, we will ensure all Australians have very fast broadband and we will do it sooner, cheaper and hence more affordably than the Labor government can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He planned on doing this by scrapping the full fibre-to-the-premises broadband rollout and instead upgrading and repurposing existing infrastructure—that would be that old copper network that's nearly 100 years old in some places. While the coalition's multi-technology mix—or multi-technology mess, as it's usually referred to—was promoted as being able to deliver faster and cheaper broadband, for many customers this has proved to be not the case at all. It is a second-rate network. Quite frankly, if you had left the rollout of the telegraph to this government, we would have been lucky to get that. They would've told us that the carrier pigeon would be sufficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now where we are. Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the coalition NBN will take fibre to 17 per cent of the population. Consumer complaints are soaring, with a 2015-16 report from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman saying that there had been a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. It would appear that getting NBN service is not exactly the most fun experience for people who are supposed to be getting a superior service by moving their internet connection to the NBN. Indeed, many of the people who live in my community have raised with me and my office this concern: 'I have moved to the NBN and it's slower; can I go back?' There is no going back from here, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen; the government has saddled us with this problem for a very long time to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the reforms being proposed. One of the aspects of this package is to promote competition by levelling the playing field. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in NBN, and seemingly a growing one. It's important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field, so that the value of that investment is not unfairly undermined. Current network rules require a fixed-line network servicing residential and small business customers to supply a wholesale bitstream service to access-seekers and operators on a wholesale-only basis—that is, there needs to be a structural separation between retailers and wholesalers. There are a number of exceptions to these rules, such as high-speed networks built prior to 2011. The key changes to the rules are that the bill will remove regulation of networks servicing small business customers, which will enable these providers to benefit from greater competition in the market. They will allow the ACCC to exempt small start-up networks, operators of fewer than 2,000 residential customers on fixed-line networks. These reforms would also effectively allow network carriers, other than Telstra and NBN, to be vertically integrated—that is, to operate both wholesale and retail businesses on a functionally separated basis, subject, of course, to ACCC approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, all services supplied on wholesale-only and functionally separated networks will be subject to clear non-discrimination obligations. The obligation for NBN to provide broadband in areas that would otherwise not be commercial to service is unique to NBN and is not shared by its fixed-line broadband competitors. Consumers will expect that companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN to ensure that there is competitive neutrality. So this bill introduces an amendment to provide greater certainty about these arrangements, and scope and flexibility, where the ACCC decides that it's appropriate, and Labor supports these measures to ensure that this occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to that, I think it is important that we have some time to reflect upon some of the issues that we saw upon the rollout of ADSL in the first place. For my sins, I was working in the internet industry at the time when ADSL was introduced. Of course, we had the situation where Telstra, having control of all of the exchanges—being a wholesale provider and a retail provider of ADSL connectivity—was also required to maintain some degree of functional separation of its networks so that retailers could buy a wholesale service off Telstra. I'm pretty sure if you go and ask some of the providers from that time—iiNet would be a classic example—they would say that there were definitely some holes in the way in which that operated. I hope that some of the issues that arose at that time, nearly 20 years ago now, have been addressed by the way in which it is proposed the rules be amended by this bill, and going forward, to ensure we don't have same issues arise again and that we do have a proper, competitive space in this field. With all that, Labor does support the measures in the bill but, at the end of the day, it doesn't change the fact that, really, the NBN is a complete 'fraudband' network.</span>

                    </a>  The National Broadband Network was intended to provide all Australians with universal access to high-speed broadband. I'm speaking not just to the two pieces of legislation that are before the House today but also to amendments moved by the shadow minister. It's really important for us to consider the full scope of the amendments that are proposed in the second reading debate. In particular, it's important to sheet home to the Prime Minister responsibility for the issues raised in the amendment. The full extent of the condemnation of this house should fall on the Prime Minister for his actions as the then minister responsible for the National Broadband Network in creating a network, as the amendment sets out, which has cost more to deploy, delivers slower speeds, will cost more to maintain, will require expensive upgrades in the future and, most tellingly, to my mind, will generate less revenue—that is, it exposes the NBN Co to additional commercial risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the previous speaker, I've had some experience in this area as a lawyer advising people in this technology, extending back in the days when—and it's quite sad for me to say this—a link between my Launceston office and my Hobart office ran at the breathtaking speed of 300 bits per second. That's not megabits; it's 300 bits per second. Of course, in those days you didn't pay $49.95 for a connection between two communication devices; you paid thousands of dollars per month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN network was designed to provide a really important piece of national infrastructure. It was designed to provide a digital backbone based on fibre technology in order to drive not just economic opportunity but also social opportunity wherever one lived—that is, whether the user lived within one of our major cities or within regional Australia. I'll talk about regional Australia later in my address. The fibre-to-the-premises network was intended, as originally envisioned by Labor, to extend to 93 per cent of the country, with the remaining seven per cent to be served through a combination of fixed wireless and satellite technology as the circumstances and professional advice would dictate. The network would also facilitate retail competition, as the NBN was established to operate as a wholesale service provider, structurally separated from retailers so that retail competition would provide for lower prices, consumer choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned earlier that the NBN was intended to deliver particular outcomes not just for the major cities within Australia but also for regional Australia. Nowhere in Australia is this vision better demonstrated than through the efforts of the Tasmanian retail service provider Launtel, which has delivered Australia's first affordable gigabit commercial connections and domestic connections, which are between two and five times faster than those available even in the central business district of major cities. Launtel's innovation is built on the fibre-to-the-premises model championed originally by Labor. This is because fibre technology enables innovative and progressive retailers to leverage off the fibre backbone to deliver relatively cheap and amazingly fast internet experiences. This is actually an internet experience which exceeds the specifications set down by NBN Co. It demonstrates the potential of the wholesale network. NBN Co does not, at present, offer the sorts of speeds that this retail service provider is providing. Notwithstanding that, they've provided an innovative commercial solution which offers up to 1,000 megabits per second for not only commercial customers but also residential customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast this situation with that of some constituents of mine, the Goftons, who live in the north-east of my electorate on their family dairy farm. The family dairy farm lies just six kilometres from Scottsdale, which was one of the first sites in Australia to receive fibre to the premises. The Goftons wanted to improve productivity on their farm. This is a common story. Not many of us in this place appreciate that modern agricultural production requires the use of advanced technology. So they upgraded technology. Kate Gofton contacted me in February last year and indicated that the internet was absolutely critical to the everyday running of their business. She indicated that she'd invested a significant amount of money in infrastructure to overcome the particular issues that she had experienced. Their existing service is unreliable, and they have been regularly forced to pay significantly more for minimal amounts of data. She has to drive the six kilometres into Scottsdale to use the internet in Scottsdale to pay employees and make phone calls for the business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This example is just one of the stark contrasts between businesses in my electorate suffering under the current government's incompetence in delivering services to rural communities in a timely manner. So, when we talk about the digital divide, it is apparent even within electorates like my electorate of Bass, where you have some consumers and some retail users enjoying absolutely fantastically fast internet experiences, where they can download gigabytes of data within minutes, and, in contrast to that, somebody who relies upon the internet for their business being required to effectively move their business to an adjacent town just to pay their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statutory infrastructure regime, or the SIP, contained in this bill implements in legislation Labor's original vision of universal access—a vision that was outlined almost a decade ago. This is a welcome development in order to provide certainty to stakeholders, consumers and, importantly, industry. As I said earlier, Labor's vision extended to fibre to the premises being used for all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint. Disappointingly—indeed, some could say disgracefully—this government, in the pursuit of what it calls a multi-technology mix, but which can properly be described as a multi-technology mess, has facilitated the rollout of new copper into new suburbs, despite the fact that this copper cannot deliver the fast speeds already available for retailers like Launtel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any question about universal standards of service needs to address the technology mix as a question of principle. This government defines superfast broadband as a service nominally providing 25 megabits per second or more. This definition preserves the government's technology-agnostic approach and would permit the extension of existing fibre-to-the-node networks to newly constructed homes beyond the term of this parliament. Any outcome, however unlikely to be facilitated, is of serious concern to Labor, as it is inconsistent with Labor's policy of fibre to the premises as the preferred approach, with fibre to the kerb being the minimum approach. This bill does nothing to address the issue that is likely to entrench the digital divide that I referred to earlier between those who are fortunate enough to have fibre to the premises and those who are not. I'm fortunate enough to have fibre to the premises at home and, being required to use remote technology in order to access the internet, not just in this place, I sometimes find that, even at 100 megabits per second, what you're seeking to achieve can be constrained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN rollout demonstrates time and time again the failure in policy of the Turnbull government. The Turnbull NBN, as contemplated by this amendment, costs more and is less effective. The Prime Minister initially promised that his version of the NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. The cost has blown out to $49 billion, and I understand from material released recently that it even exceeds that. The Prime Minister promised that every household and small business would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. Let's test that proposition. How many were left unconnected—that is, not connected to the NBN—as at the end of 2016? It's not a trivial number: seven million homes were left without access to the internet at the end of 2016. There are still more than 5.5 million homes—again, 2½ years after that time—waiting for the present government's deficient NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the multi-technology mess will take fibre to only 17 per cent of the population. The balance of the Australian population will not and cannot have access to the innovative services already available from retailers like Launtel—again perpetuating this significant digital divide based upon the technology that the Prime Minister said previously was good enough for ordinary Australians. Mind you, this Prime Minister elected to have a fibre connection for his own residence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, consumer complaints are soaring. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman in its 2015-16 report highlighted a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. A recent Choice survey reported that 62 per cent of Australians are experiencing slow speeds and unreliable services. The level-playing-field rules are designed, nevertheless, to provide protection for NBN Co to ensure that its significant investment in wholesale infrastructure is not unfairly undermined. This is the commercial risk that I referred to earlier, in my opening comments. The NBN was designed to utilise uniform wholesale pricing to ensure that wholesale access for regional Australia was the same as for the cities. In this respect, the NBN is underpinned by an internal cross-subsidy that uses profits from services in the city to fund services in the region. The service obligation expressly contemplates that NBN Co will provide broadband in areas where it would not be commercial to provide those services. This obligation is unique to NBN Co and is not shared by any of its broadband competitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public policy should ensure that companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are broadly subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co so as to ensure competitive neutrality. The level-playing-field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act date back to 2011. They apply to superfast fixed-line networks that service residential and small-business customers. Part 7 of the act requires operators of these networks to make their networks available to access seekers—that is, retail service providers. In many respects the amendments proposed by this legislation that are necessary in order to impose a charge or levy upon competing networks are a product of this Prime Minister encouraging the construction of a competing network. Obviously, to protect the structural separation of the network, it's important that we protect NBN Co's monopoly as a wholesale service provider. So Labor will support the bill. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. These bills, which work in conjunction with each other, do two key things: legislate certainty that all premises in Australia can access high-speed broadband infrastructure after the NBN rollout, and introduce a telecommunications levy that will add $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not be opposing these bills. Labor support legislating a universal right to broadband access, as this was the principle we first established when the NBN was announced. Putting the arrangements in legislation will provide certainty beyond the NBN rollout. Labor supports the establishment of a statutory infrastructure provider regime as outlined in schedule 3 of this bill. The statutory infrastructure provider regime will offer certainty that, as we move beyond the initial NBN rollout, every Australian home and small business can get access to a high-speed broadband connection. This would put in legislation an important reform that was initiated by Labor almost a decade ago and implemented through a statement of expectations issued to the NBN board. The statement of expectations required the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After more than a decade, John Howard had left Australia a broadband backwater. Little has been done under this government. It took those opposite many years to sign up to Labor's principle, but in the end the Australian public gave them no choice. Labor is proud of having fought and reached this point. It's fundamentally about fairness in the digital age. It will ensure that Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live, study or work. But there is so much more to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of this bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax of $7.10 per month, which would apply to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 by 2021. This is Turnbull's internet tax. He owns it. It has come about due to his cost blowouts. The levy will impact the non-NBN networks in the ACT, regional Victoria, the fibre-to-the-basement network in inner city areas and fibre networks in new estates. It is telling that, in the week of the federal budget, the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new broadband tax, which is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. The government's internet tax is expected to add $84 to the annual bill of up to 400,000 residential and businesses services on non-NBN networks. Labor consider this regrettable, but we won't be opposing it. The economics of the NBN are now precarious. It is also important for NBN to be able to compete on a level playing field. An effect of this levy is that it will help to achieve that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, the then Labor government decided to build a national broadband network that would extend universal coverage of broadband to regional and remote Australia. This was an important initiative, a true Labor reform and one we are proud of. This decision to extend high-speed broadband across Australia was funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. This meant that NBN users in the cities would help cross-subsidise higher cost areas in the regions, like my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It was not part of our plan that there would be a universal wholesale pricing regime and a levy. It was one or the other; it wasn't both. Yet now the government wants to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with a new internet tax. What's changed? The cost of fixed wireless and satellite networks hasn't changed, the cost of effectively what was forecast. The key change has been the abandonment of fibre on the pretext that Australia would get a much cheaper—but, we know, inferior—multi-technology mix. We haven't. What we have is a more expensive, $49 billion multi-technology mix that costs more and does less and that generates $300 million less per annum in revenue relative to a fibre-to-the-premises network. This has created a problem the government now wants to fix with a new tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's 2013 election commitment to deliver the NBN for $29.5 billion and complete it by 2016 was a hoax. The cost of the NBN project increased from $29.5 billion to $41 billion in late 2013. By August 2015, it had increased again by a further $8 billion, bringing the cost of the NBN rollout to $49 billion, with a completion date of 2020—$20 billion over budget and four years behind what the Prime Minister promised. Leaks reveal the cost of remediating copper has increased tenfold to over $600 million. In 2016, the cost of deploying the HFC network again increased, by another $2 billion, as problems began to mount. But there are also challenges on the revenue side. In 2017, retail service providers were called out for selling speed plans the copper NBN could not and did not deliver. Nearly one in two customers on the copper NBN network who were paying for the top speeds had their speeds downgraded and were compensated as a result. It was later reported that one in three homes on copper cannot achieve 50 megabits per second and three in four cannot achieve 100 megabits per second. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, the Senate learned that no funding has been set aside in the government's NBN business case out to 2040 to upgrade its copper footprint. Put another way, the already shaky economics of the NBN rely on the assumption that Australians won't need their copper network upgraded for at least another 23 years. So, under this Prime Minister, we have an inferior NBN that cost $4 billion more for taxpayers to build, delivers slower speeds, is less reliable, costs more to maintain, is more exposed to competition from wireless, costs more to upgrade and generates less revenue for those willing to pay. It's crap! </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians remain frustrated with their experiences on the NBN. My constituents continually raise these issues with me. How many NBN complaints do you think have come to one electoral office—100, 200, 300 or 400? To date, 490 people in my electorate have contacted my office to complain about the NBN. Why? Because of slow speeds, dropouts and unreliable services. They make appointments with technicians only to find that no-one turns up. Their issues and complaints are being buck passed, without accountability, between the NBN and the provider and back to the NBN. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could stand here until the chamber adjourns and would have mentioned only a few. But let's make a start. Let's kick off with the 'You're not on the map' NBN problem. Vicky is a beauty therapist in Bateau Bay. She has been trying for several months to get her business connected to the NBN. She tried several providers but each told her she could not be connected because her address could not be found on the NBN system. When she contacted NBN Co to try to sort it out they referred her to Optus. Optus looked into it—and guess what? They referred her back to NBN Co. And so it goes on. What about the 'It's somebody else's problem' NBN complaint? </span>

The PBRI is not intended to become a stand-alone funding or delivery organisation. Instead of creating a new administration layer, the PBRI will harness the significant collective investment power of the plant RDCs. Analysis by the Council of Rural RDCs estimates the average leverage across all RDCs is $1.27 for every $1 invested by an RDC. Therefore, based on the plant biosecurity RDE investment for 2015-16 ($62.9 million) the cash and in-kind contributions from interested parties for plant biosecurity RD&amp;E is estimated to have been $80 million in that year.</span>
