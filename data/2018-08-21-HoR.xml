                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I'd like to thank all members who have contributed to this debate. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Sector Regulation) Bill 2018 demonstrates our government's utmost commitment to building a financial sector that is accountable to the Australian people, resilient to developments both domestically and globally, and highly competitive. It helps to ensure that the benefits of financial sector innovation flow to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will contribute to the development of a robustly competitive domestic financial sector in two complementary ways: firstly, by making it easier for new financial sector companies, banks and life and general insurance providers to operate with the types of concentrated ownership structures that are a natural part of that stage of the business life cycle; and, secondly, by facilitating a new restricted authorised deposit institution licensing regime that will allow start-ups to test their business model for up to two years before having to comply with the full suite of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's regulatory requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to this bill, which amends the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, relaxes ownership restrictions by, first, lifting from 15 per cent to 20 per cent the ownership threshold for all financial sector companies beyond which ministerial approval is required. This will align the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act thresholds with those existing in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, thereby simplifying financial sector investments. Second, it will create a new streamlined Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval path for the owners of new and recently established financial sector companies that are incorporated domestically and have less than $200 million in assets or, in the case of general insurance providers, $50 million in assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this streamlined approval path, firms will be approved to have a concentrated ownership structure as long as the owners are fit and proper and the firm agrees to have its ownership structure reviewed regularly and to provide relevant prudential information to APRA on a regular basis. This overcomes a significant unintended consequence of the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act. The existing national interest test, which is intentionally broad to provide a comprehensive assessment of owners of our most significant institutions, is unnecessarily complex for start-ups which pose little risk to consumers and the financial stability of the system. As a result, start-ups can struggle to secure the financing they need to grow, given investors' concerns that approval under the test may not be granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By removing uncertainty around the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approvals, this reform encourages investment in Australian start-ups and makes our financial sector more contestable, generating better quality and lower priced products for consumers. Further, given the requirement for owners that receive approval in this way to either divest their stake or obtain Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval in the usual way, once their companies grow beyond the relevant asset thresholds, these reforms maintain the necessary protections against the risks associated with concentrated ownership structures within larger institutions that the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act currently provides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill delivers on the second objective, supporting the operation of APRA's new restricted authorised deposit institution licensing regime. Similar to a model that has been in place in the United Kingdom since 2014, resulting in 14 new banks, APRA has announced the establishment of a new restricted authorised deposit institute licence as a transitional step towards a full licence. This will give start-up banks up to two years to test their business model, access to the finance they need to grow and a lighter-touch regulatory environmentâ€”opportunities that do not exist given that today banks must comply with all regulations on day 1.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To facilitate, this bill empowers APRA to impose a time-limited condition on banking licences where institutions are seeking a restricted authorised deposit institute licence and remove such licences without merits review when the licence holder is found to be non-compliant with their regulatory requirements or not able to develop sufficient resources to acquire a full unrestricted banking licence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the revocation of a licence without the possibility of a merits review is a significant step, it is a necessary protection for Australian consumers and a reasonable trade-off for the opportunities granted by holding a restricted licence. Under this approach, natural justice would still be provided to time-limited licensees, with APRA required to provide notice of its intent to revoke a licence in writing and allow the licensee to make submissions in its defence. It will also have no impact on banks with a full banking licence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, this bill is yet another step on the government's well-laid path to improve financial sector competition and deliver better outcomes for all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  It's a great pleasure to make a contribution to the Unexplained Wealth Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 on behalf of the Labor opposition. We believe that this bill is a step forward in the quest to establish a national unexplained wealth scheme in Australia and that that's a good thing. I don't want to overstate our enthusiasm, because people who have been watching this debate will note that there's only one state that's opted in to be a part of the scheme. That's New South Wales. Nonetheless, anything that enhances the opportunity for us to take the profit out of crime is, in Labor's view, a good thing, and that's why we're supporting the bill before the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that we need an unexplained wealth scheme in Australia is because, unfortunately, some of the people who profit the most out of crime are people who are not directly committing crimes themselves. What we often observe in organised crime networks is people sitting at the top who have extraordinary wealth that can't properly be explained by the income that appears to be coming legally into that household. This is an instance where an unexplained wealth order is the perfect way that police forces, whether they be state or federal, can get to the bottom of what is behind this wealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I turn to the detail of the bill, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the incredible agencies that underpin the work that's before the House at the moment. This includes the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, AUSTRAC, state and territory police forces and many other agencies that are in charge of making sure Australians are safe. Australia is one of the safest countries in the world, and that is in large part due to the hard work and dedication of the outstanding people who volunteer to put themselves in harm's way every day so the rest of us can walk the streets of this country safely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most privileged parts of this role that I have as the shadow minister for justice is having the opportunity to actually meet and speak with these people who work in law enforcement all over the country. I always ask them one question in the conversations that we have: what is one thing that the federal parliament can do to make your job easier and to make you more effective in your quest to make Australia a safer place? Without question, the most common response I get from people is that we need to work harder to take the profit out of crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Serious and organised crime is a very significant problem in Australia. Estimates suggest that this is costing our country's economy somewhere around $36 billion every year. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimates that this equates to somewhere around $1,500 out of every individual Australian's pocket every year. It is an enormous cost to our economy and it adds somewhere around 6.3 per cent to the average cost of living. So this is a very important endeavour to try to ensure that we can better crack down on the people who are committing these crimes and who are creating these problems for us as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unexplained wealth orders are one mechanism by which the federal parliament can assist police in making sure that they are able to keep our streets safe. The Proceeds of Crime Act is a related legislative regime, but the difference with proceeds of crime is that we first need to prove the commission of an offence before we go after the assets that are the result of that crime. Unexplained wealth orders operate in the other direction. Essentially what we need to do is find a situation where someone has extraordinary wealth that doesn't seem to meet their level of credible income, and we can then go into that person's finances if there is belief that there is proof of a crime to come. These orders are extremely valuable for combating serious organised crime. As I mentioned, often those who are profiting the most from crime are cleverly keeping themselves at arm's length from the actual commission of wrongdoing. That can't be allowed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of constitutional limitations, unexplained wealth orders at the Commonwealth level are quite limited. Of course, members in this parliament will hopefully understand that section 51 of our Constitution limits the powers of our federal parliament, and the residual powers that sit outside the things listed in section 51 sit with the states. The issue with unexplained wealth is that, if no commission of an offence is proven up-front, we can't prove that the federal parliament and the Australian Federal Police should actually have any jurisdiction over the crimes that we believe have been committed. That's why the unexplained wealth regimes work well at a state level but, federally, we haven't been able to prove a substantial use for these laws. That's the reason why creating a national scheme is something that successive governments have been trying to do for quite some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of agreement in the law enforcement community that not having a national scheme is a problem that needs to be fixed. Two former police commissioners, Mr Ken Moroney AO APM and Mr Mick Palmer AO APM, undertook an independent report of the panel on unexplained wealth in 2014. That report recommended creating a national scheme to address this quite significant need for us to address the issues of unexplained wealth that I have described. The bill would extend the existing Commonwealth unexplained wealth regime to offences that are referred by state governments and relevant offences in the Northern Territory. As I mentioned, Labor will support this bill as it is the first step in a long process towards establishing a national unexplained wealth regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to speak about a number of concerns that were expressed by stakeholders through the parliamentary process that this bill has gone through. An unexplained wealth regime does have some issues where well-established principles of law that protect us have to be amended for us to be able to put unexplained wealth laws into our parliamentary context. They are valid concernsâ€”they really areâ€”and that's why I want to draw them out in this discussion. They are things like the abrogation of legal professional privilege, the privilege against self-incrimination, issues around use and derivative use immunity, and immunity from liability. These are all core principles in law that essentially allow individuals to protect themselves from admitting to liability for crimes. In some senses, the unexplained wealth regime probably doesn't technically sit well with those principles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want the stakeholders who have made a contribution to this discussion to understand is that the bill before us is not changing any powers that the federal government has over individuals. It's not changing the powers of police in any way. It's just extending existing powers over new offences. There is a debate to be had, perhaps, about unexplained wealth regimes, but this bill is really not the place to do that. I believe we have a good structure in place and we have some really good protections, too, that are enshrined in law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the protections is a judicial discretion to refuse to grant an order when the amount is less than $100,000. That's a protection under the federal regime. It doesn't exist under a lot of state regimes. What that means is that in some state regimes police can use unexplained wealth orders for what are really quite small crimes. I think the people who have worked on this legislative regime over a long of time have agreed that if we are going to abrogate these legal principles, we're going to do it in cases where we believe there are incredibly serious crimes that have been committed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, when we talk about unexplained wealth, we're usually talking about a regime that is designed to apprehend the kingpins who sit at the top of organised crime networks, or at least people who are in some way party to organised criminal activities. This is not about someone stealing CDs out of a car and then having their legal rights stripped from them; this is about trying to tackle criminals who are incredibly expert at hiding their crimes. In this chamber, as the people who support law enforcement, we need to help those people who are law enforcers to build a skills set and have a set of legal rights that lets them get behind those networks of bank accounts and assets being put around the world, where we know that criminals are often hiding their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current federal law has the judicial discretion to refuse to grant an order when the amount under question is less than $100,000. Again, this goes to that point about targeting people whose wealth is really quite immense and extreme. There is also judicial discretion to refuse to grant an order when it's not in the general public interest. That's a generalised concernâ€”perhaps for where we have a court which considers, for whatever reason, that the legal rights being abrogated in this regime are not worthwhile for the interests of justice. And there is a judicial discretion to exclude certain property from the scope of the order, or to revoke an order when that is in the public interest or the interests of justice to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I point out to the parliament and to the very learned people who participate in these debates that while I accept that there are issues with this regime I'm also very confident that the federal law actually provides quite good protections and that they're often better than the protections that are provided by the states. In a sense, we have a Commonwealth regime which is taking some of those powers from the states and establishing them in a national framework. I think that's actually going to enhance the protections for a lot of Australians. The protections that apply to this regime also apply to a broader range of offencesâ€”again, supporting that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In thinking about whether to support this bill, and given some of the issues that were raised, really, the question for Labor was not, 'Is our national unexplained wealth regime perfect?' but, 'Would we like to see a national model, hopefully, at some stage progressing further, rather than enacting one where we have just one state joiningâ€”New South Wales?' The answer to that question is, of course, 'Yes, that's a very desirable thing.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I discussed this bill with the Australian Federal Police, they talked to me about some of the specific challenges that they face in tackling serious and organised crime without a national scheme. They were very clear that they do need a national approach to help our agencies catch the kingpins who are profiting from some very genuinely and seriously awful crime. We're talking about drug crime, major fraud syndicates and even human trafficking, often at the end of the line. We are absolutely committed to keeping Australians safe and to providing law enforcement with the powers that they need to do their jobs effectively. For that reason, we will support the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation is a step in the right direction, as I hope I have explained properly to the chamber. I don't see this as a game changer. We've got the framework for a national scheme. We've only got one state that has opted in thus far, but I hope that will change over time. But it's certainly not the beginning and the end of what we need to see being done more effectively when it comes to law enforcement. One of the deep frustrations I've had with the various people on the other side of the chamber who've been in charge of this portfolio is this consistent talking a big game about law and order. But when it comes down to budget time and to doing really fundamental things that are important to keeping Australians safe, such as funding the Australian Federal Police, I find the government falling short.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018-19 budget, the government cut the AFP's core federal police work by $139 million over the coming four years. We were able to follow that up through the Senate estimates process, asking, 'What does $139 million look like when we're talking about people in uniform who are out on the street protecting Australians?' During that process, the Australian Federal Police commissioner confirmed that this would result in a cut of 567 AFP personnel over the forward estimates. That's because of the Turnbull government's cuts.</span>

We are talking here about law enforcement and the tools that law enforcement have to fight crime in our country, so I think the Australian Federal Police and its resourcing is quite relevant to the subject. I think the minister may not agree because he doesn't want to front up to the 567 personnel that will be cut over the forward estimates.

I'm just going to point this out for the benefit of the House, if that's okayâ€”it's too early in the day to get grumpy. Ordinarily there is some tolerance, in fairness to the member for Hotham, except on this occasion, this bill does have a restricted long and short title.

                    </a>  Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I very much appreciate your guidance. The urgent need is for law enforcement to have the resources and the tools that they need, and we are pleased to see a small step being made towards assisting the Australian Federal Police officers who put a uniform on every day to try to protect Australians. It's important that they have the resources to do that. I think I've said enough about that.</span>

We're very lucky today and we do live in one of the safest countries in the world, but we also know that organised crime is a significant and growing problem. Each year $36 billion is being wasted whilst criminals, in some instances, live in the lap of luxury on money that they did not lawfully acquire. It's important that law enforcement have the tools they need to fight those crimes. We're very pleased to support the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  It's always good to see you in the chair, Mr Speaker. The point of the Unexplained Wealth Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 is really quite straightforward: if you do the crime, you don't keep the dime.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TIM WILSON:</span>
                    </a>  That is the basis on which I support this legislation. It isn't just that if you do the crime, you don't keep the dimeâ€”just to repeat it for the interjecting memberâ€”but also, of course, if you find the dime and you've done the crime, there's a consequence. The actions of organised crime syndicates often have tragic human consequences like theft, violence and, in the worst cases, of course, loss of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also economic costs associated with criminal behaviour. The wealth accumulation of criminals costs this country tens of billions of dollars each year. They engage in behaviour like illicit tobacco, which I spoke about recently. We have seen people take advantage of government policy that creates high consumer surplus for interchangeable products, and they don't deserve their wealth. What they do deserve is justice. These crooks use to their advantage discreet monetary networks across jurisdictional boundaries and borders to undermine the rule of law; to undermine decent, legal activity; and to the benefit solely of themselves at the expense of our community, the government and our nation at large. That's why a national approach is necessary for our law enforcement agencies with the tools to seize back the wealth that has been taken nefariously and that they acquire by robbing our communities of their health, wellbeing and safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this bill seeks to achieve. It recognises that, where people work hard, earn, save, pay taxes and operate in the regular economy, their effort is rewarded and respected. It ensures that those who seek to circumvent that process to their own advantage and to society's detriment will face justice. This bill will allow the Australian Federal Police to confiscate the assets of criminals that obtain their wealth illegally by engaging in illegal practices. It will also allow state and territory agencies to use lawfully intercepted telecommunications information in unexplained wealth matters. Now, don't misunderstand: in this space where people have wealth, I'm not a big fan of a government coming along, surveying and seeing what people are doing. I'm not a big fan of having a big-brotherish approach, even if it is the Tax Office or the AFP or any other regulatory body intercepting what private citizens are doing lawfully. But where there is a basis that people have been doing things unlawfully at the expense of the community at largeâ€”including not just unexplained wealth for their own private benefit but also invariably because of activity that is not taxed and that is not treated equally to those of good citizens who are doing the right thingâ€”we do need to take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme was recommended in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Final </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport of the National Ice T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">askforce </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2015</span>. I know, from the Goldstein community and from talking to many other members in this place, including often those who are representing disadvantaged communities or those in rural and regional areas, that ice is having a horrendous effect and impact on individuals, families and communities across our great Commonwealth. The government's National Ice Action Strategy is expanding access to early intervention and treatment, particularly for high-risk populations. But we must also choke the supply of illicit drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale and the complexity of the drug-peddling criminal networks should not intimidate us in this place. We are here to uphold the rule of law and to make sure that it is enforced. They are lining their pockets with wealth gained from human misery and tragedy. It's encouraging to see such strong cooperation with the states and territories in designing this national cooperative scheme with the leadership of the Commonwealth, particularly the New South Wales government, who introduced the supporting legislation only earlier this year. By creating a national cooperative scheme, the unexplained wealth regimes across all jurisdictions will be strengthened so that we can have the legal framework we need, as a nation, to uphold the rule of law so that those people who do the right thing are rewarded and carry no more of their share of the burden on the community as a whole, and so that those people who do the wrong thing face confiscation and justice and contribute, disproportionately, the consequences of their ill-gotten gains. I recommend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I rise to support the Unexplained Wealth Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. I have supported the notion of an unexplained wealth bill ever since the first iteration back in 2009. I think it's important that we put strong laws in place to combat serious and organised crime. We need to target the profits of crime and remove the incentive for criminals to engage in criminal enterprise. We also need to empower our law enforcement agencies to defeat the sophisticated methods used by those criminal organisations to avoid detection, often by relying on the assistance of skilled professionals. Nevertheless, those at the high pointâ€”those responsible for running criminal enterprisesâ€”are normally the ones who escape detection by ensuring that they are far removed from the actual commissioning of a crime itself. We have, on this side, always supported various tools to combat serious and organised crime, such as covert investigative tools like controlled operations, assumed identities or telecommunication interception. What we have done, continually, is to ensure that our police, our law enforcement agencies, have the necessary tools they need to fight contemporary crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2009 I had the opportunity, with the parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, to visit a number of overseas jurisdictions dealing with the issue of serious and organised crime. One thing that became very clear to usâ€”and I suppose this is also clear to all the police officers who serve us in this countryâ€”is that serious and organised crime is motivated by greed for power and money. It has serious impacts. It threatens our economy, our national security and, for that matter, the wellbeing of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of serious and organised crime has already been recognised internationally. In 1997, INTERPOL carried a resolution recommending that all member states adopt effective laws giving law-enforcement officials the power that they need to combat money laundering both domestically and internationally, including the reverse onus of proof in respect of confiscation of alleged proceeds of crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2009, at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in the 18th Session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the chair of that organisation had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ in the past quarter century, the nature of crime has changed. It has become organized and transnational; it has reached macro-economic dimensions; it has turned into a global business operating in collusion with legitimate activity. It has become more than localized violenceâ€”it has turned into a widespread threat to the security of cities, states, even entire regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chair of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The UN Security Council has dealt with the issue of national security threatened by organized crime in a number of countries. Around the world organized crime has changed strategic doctrines and threat assessments. It is causing alarm among citizens, politicians and media alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And he summed up one aspect of the fight against crime when he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We face a crime wave that has become a security crisis. It must be stopped before it spreads even more fear, corruption, violence and poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the key part. I know it threatened many that had views as to civil liberties. But the key part to his address was this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The political will of states is mightier than the greed and fire power of criminal groups. Working together does not mean surrendering sovereignty, it means defending it. So let us enforce the rule of law where uncivil society prevails.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the bill before us does is to simply set a national prescription for matters relating to unexplained wealth. As I said at the start, this is a concept that has certainly been around since 2009, when the then Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, brought legislation into this place. However, as my colleague over there, the member for La Trobe, will well recall, amendments were made by members on the other side, seeking to protect the civil liberties of individualsâ€”in this case, the civil liberties of criminal elementsâ€”that, regrettably, had the effect of ensuring that the unexplained wealth legislation could not be relied upon. As a matter of fact, on its first review, it found that not one single case had been used by the police in respect of stripping criminals of their ill-gotten gains or their criminal assets. I commend the member for La Trobe. I know that many, including former President Senator Stephen Parry, have spoken regularly on the issue of unexplained wealth. More importantly, they have also spoken about ensuring our police have the tools they need to fight contemporary crime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Organised crime is motivated by money. There's a financial incentive to it. Back in 2009, I think, it was estimated that the cost of organised crime was something like $15 billion, annually, to this nation alone. Making criminals account for their criminal assets or making them explain and put in jeopardy those assets that they can't prove were gained by legal means has been an effective way of disrupting and dismantling criminal enterprise. It's clear from various organisations I visited, both here and overseas, together with the member for La Trobe, that the notion of putting in jeopardy the ill-gotten gains of criminal enterprise was something law enforcement agencies thought had considerable merit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, when we were overseas discussing the notion of unexplained wealth, we were one of the few nations exploring it. There's always been the concept of proceeds of crime. With the actual crime that's been committedâ€”after someone's been caught, prosecuted and convicted of a particular crimeâ€”the assets from that crime could be in jeopardy and stripped from them, but not the notion of, if they're caught and found to be a criminal, being able to put in doubt all remaining assets they hold, unless they could prove they were gained by legal means. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the concept of attacking the very business model that underpins organised crime itself. Certainly all agencies we visited agreed that unexplained wealth attacks the very heart of organised crime. But there were some caveats put on that, things that people believed were necessary. They didn't understand the concepts of Australian states having different regimes when it came to proceeds of crime. That's been one of the challenges to unexplained wealth. Regrettably, it does get back to the money and where the money goes. As my colleague the member for La Trobe would be more than well aware, when there's a reliance on a federal law, whether it's the AFP or the Crime Commission, to that extent, there's the question: which jurisdiction would receive the proceeds of the crime itself or put a claim in for the unexplained wealth that is stripped from criminal enterprise? It got to a situation where we had each state with a different regime when it came to proceeds of crime. The problem with a federal law was that it only related to a federally determined crime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this piece of legislation does, to put it crudely, is set a national prescription, a floor, that all our states and territories and the Australian Federal Police can rely upon in terms of making prosecutions and being able to strip assets that cannot be explained. This is something which I think is a new dimension. It's something that's brought the states closer and closer together. It's no longer a situation where each of the states is talking about what's good for their interests. For the first time the states are showing the reality of dealing with criminal enterprise. That is, criminal groups do not look to a map when they want to commit a crime. They will look to loopholes in jurisdictions where it's least likely they're going to be caught or least likely they're going to be prosecuted. Having a consistent approach is going to strengthen all our law enforcement agencies across the country. It will ensure that they are all in a position to attack the very business model that underpins crime itselfâ€”that is, making a profit. Simply, if you can strip the assets of a criminal group, it almost invites them to think about whether or not to get into this enterprise in the first place. That's because, if you're caught, not only can you lose the assets of the crime that you've actually committed but you could be called upon to explain, through a reverse onus of proof where you're responsible, how every other asset that you own was gained by legal means. If you can't explain that, it will be open to the prosecutors through the courts to strip all those assets. This is what we mean when we talk about unexplained wealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We met with many jurisdictions. Particularlyâ€”as the member for La Trobe will recallâ€”the anti-Mafia police in Italy made it very clear to us that serious criminal groups would be happy to spend time in jail being incarcerated. What they weren't happy about was if efforts were made to take away their assetsâ€”their blocks of flats, their houses, their vehicles and all those sorts of things. If you take away their assets, you actually take away more than just a person's identity; you show that these people are completely vulnerable to law-abiding citizens of their country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unexplained wealth is a relatively new concept. It protects the community by deliberately attacking serious and organised crime. It's designed to disrupt criminal enterprise itself. The effective notion of unexplained wealth is, as I say, to protect our community and to put criminals out of business to ensure that we can live in a safer environment. To all those police and other law enforcement officers, I have complete respect for the work that you do. You make a difference for the better in our communities. We must provide you with the tools necessary to do your job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  This speech on unexplained wealth is a bit like deja vu. I heard the member for Fowler talk about it back in 2009. I'll read some of my speech from back then, but we were nearly cracking the champagne bottles, believing the police would have the best law enforcement tool in the countryâ€”that being unexplained wealth orders. I just want to explain the difference to proceeds of crime, which people hear about. Proceeds of crime is more where the police have actually charged a personâ€”obviously a criminalâ€”and they can directly connect that criminal to, say, drug money which has then been used to buy cars or other sorts of assets. That is the proceeds of crime. Unexplained wealth fits in where there's wealth which doesn't match that person's employment. It can have connections to, say, organised criminals, but you normally find they're so far removed now from the actual crimes that they've been able to keep their wealth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fowler has been a fantastic ambassador for law enforcement. We went on this inquiry back in 2009 with the former President of the Senate Mr Parry, and the delegation was led by Senator Hutchins at the time. It was a bipartisan delegation with one view of really taking on crime and finding out how we can actually make a difference and give law enforcement tools they can use. Back in 2009, estimates were that in Australia $15 billion was being raised for organised crime, which could easily be taken for unexplained wealth. You find, for example, outlaw motorcycle gangs work in obviously the space of major drugs and major crimeâ€”organised crime groups. But, as they move up in organisationsâ€”the further they go up the ladder, the more money they haveâ€”they are more able to distance themselves from the actual committing of crimes. They then pay other people to do the actual crimes. That's what makes the unexplained wealth legislation so special. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of our inquiry in 2009, the delegation went to Canada, the United States, Italy, Austria, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In conjunction with the Australian Crime Commission, the delegation examined serious and organised crime and, basically, put together recommendations for going forward. What we were getting told overseas was that you have to follow the money trail. Serious organised crime is about two things: creating great wealth and creating power. But power will not come unless you have great wealth. If you take the money awayâ€”we heard this all the timeâ€”you will take the power away; it's as simple as that. In every country we visited, there was a view in law enforcement that you needed to go after the moneyâ€”follow the money trail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in Italy we spoke to the anti-Mafia police. Italy's unexplained wealth laws were incredible. I still recall a storyâ€”they had a business person who owned I think it was a chain of supermarkets and they actually put orders on that person and seized 280 million euros because they could link that person to having meetings with various associates of organised crime groups. Being an ex-police officer, I know how important it is to go after the money in order to remove what the lieutenants from the Mr Bigs. That is what will make a huge difference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation did go to the Senate, and changes were made by our good friends in the other place. But I remember one of the disappointing things about this legislation back in 2009 was that those changes meant that the police would have to revealâ€”this was in a civil jurisdictionâ€”to the defendant any informants the police had. Who would want to give evidence or information to police as an informer and have it handed over to a Mr Big? We know what's going to happen there. That was a crazy recommendation. The other disappointing thing was that unexplained wealth could be used to fund the defence of the person; therefore, there's no incentive ever to finalise a case, and it will go on and on and on. This is where this legislation is really important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Hotham and I congratulate her for her comments; and I see the member for Mitchell, who has been absolutely passionate about this and about supporting law enforcement. It was great to see members of the Australian Federal Police in the building todayâ€”Mark Burgess and his body of men and women representing what I think are now 70,000 members across the country. They appeared before our previous inquiries about law enforcement and absolutely backed the need for unexplained wealth legislation. The problem with the legislation, which has come to light againâ€”and we're here now back in 2018â€”is that at the Commonwealth level the legislation required a specific link to a Commonwealth offence such as drug trafficking in commercial quantities or fraud at the Commonwealth level. You don't capture the people who may be involved in organised crime where the police can't show a link. It could be they've been involved in, as we saw in Melbourne, armed robberies of jewellery stores, for example. It wouldn't fit under the criteria. What we needed to seeâ€”and this is all because of the constitutional restrictions of the states and the Commonwealthâ€”is the states basically handing over their unexplained wealth legislation and using the Commonwealth's, with the agreement of divvying up the proceeds. You'd think this would be an easy thing. In my home state of Victoria, if you put the might and power of the AFP and their resources with that of our great state police, the whole purpose should be to go after the money, but, sadly, it's been stalled by governments, probably of all persuasions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I definitely make the point now that it's great to see that the New South Wales Liberal government has come on board and have expanded their powers to allow the Commonwealth to use their unexplained wealth provisions. This would also be able to help law enforcement when criminal organisations go across states. For example, you may find a criminal has assets in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. What would be required at the moment is for each state to use their own unexplained wealth legislation. You wouldn't have an umbrella approach. That is why this legislation is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the Victorian state government, why would the Labor government refuse to do this? They have their own powers. Their own powers will not give them the same amount of money at a Commonwealth level. Why? Because the Commonwealth can link not only states and territories but also internationally and really make a huge difference. I call on the Daniel Andrews government to really make it an urgent need to get this in place. Queensland and South Australia obviously need to come on board too. This is going to be a fantastic tool at a national level. It's going to help law enforcement. Think about this: it's going to get more money from the people we don't want to have that moneyâ€”those who commit harm on Australians and also people overseas. I emphasise: this is a great day, now that New South Wales has come on board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I congratulate the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, for all the amazing work he's done in this space, pushing this cause. At the Commonwealth level, in this building, everyone has worked very closely together. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  As those who have spoken before me noted, the Unexplained Wealth Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 provides a legislative framework at the federal level for a national cooperative scheme on unexplained wealth. I note that this policy was first developed under the former Labor government, which is testimony to this side's commitment to laws and policies to combat crime, particularly serious and organised crime. This bill really improves the Commonwealth's capacity to take profit out of serious and organised crime by extending the Commonwealth regime to referred state offences. While it may seem something quite minor, it has a rather significant impact on the way in which our law enforcement agencies have the capacity to target and combat serious and organised crime. With serious and organised crime, often those who obtain the wealth through the crime are not always directly involved in the commission of the offence. In other words, those who are making money from crime are often the ones who have their hands clean, in terms of actually committing an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to constitutional limitations, the current Commonwealth unexplained wealth orders can only be used when a court is reasonably satisfied:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(i) that the person has committed an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a foreign indictable offence or a State offence that has a federal aspect;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(ii) that the whole or any part of the person's wealth was derived from an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a foreign indictable offence or a State offence that has a federal aspect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That means that, in practice, law enforcement must prove a federal link in order to pursue these orders. Because serious and organised crime groups often work across state boundariesâ€”and not just state boundaries but also transnational boundaries as wellâ€”it can be rather difficult to detect whether their unexplained wealth derives from a Commonwealth offence or from a state offence. This bill, by creating a national unexplained wealth scheme, allows states to refer power to the Commonwealth and for the proceeds from the scheme to be divided on an equitable basis between the participating jurisdictions, being either a state law enforcement agency or a federal law enforcement agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In effect, the bill extends the scope of Commonwealth unexplained wealth restraining orders and unexplained wealth orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act to territory offences. It allows participating state and territory agencies to access Commonwealth information-gathering powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act for the investigation or litigation of unexplained wealth matters under state or territory unexplained wealth legislation. I think there's an important point here about the participating states. At this stage, only New South Wales and the Northern Territory have agreed to be party to this scheme. I think that other state law enforcement agencies are perhaps waiting to see how this regime works out in both New South Wales and the Territory, but particularly in New South Wales. In some statesâ€”for example, Western Australiaâ€”state-based law enforcement agencies have only just gotten powers around unexplained wealth. So for them it will be a matter of trying what they have at the moment and waiting to see how this scheme works for similar law enforcement agencies in others jurisdictions, like New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, as I mentioned earlier, supports measures to combat serious and organised crime. I just want to take a little bit of time here to emphasise the impacts of serious and organised crime for Australia. The economic impacts are around $36 billion a year. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimates that that equates to about $1,561 out of every individual Australian's pocket and adds about 6.3 per cent to the average cost of living. There is profit in crime, and we need to be doing everything that we can to take the profit out of crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than that, unexplained wealth and crimes associated with unexplained wealth extend across a whole range of criminal activities. Among them are modern slavery and forced labour. I note that sometime this week, we hope, we'll be speaking about a modern slavery bill here in this House, so it's quite timely that these two bills come before the House at this time. There have been cases, as a matter of fact, of unexplained wealth that do involve modern slavery and forced labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, we have unexplained wealth that works across jurisdictions and across states, but also transnationally. There are connections not just with serious and organised crime but also with terrorism. So it's very timely that Australia has come to this point where we introduce a more robust framework for tackling unexplained wealthâ€”not just the economic costs of unexplained wealth but also the costs in terms of the potential damage it can do in criminal matters and in matters of violence and terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do have to make the point that, while this introduces a more robust legislative framework for dealing with serious and organised crime, legislation alone is certainly not enough. We also need to ensure that we have well-resourced law enforcement personnel within Australia so that they can utilise the legislation that is available to them. I think that is what we need to stress here today: the capacity and the capability of our law enforcement to take full advantage of and utilise all the legislative tools that we give them in terms of prosecuting serious and organised crime, ensuring that Australia is free from the profits of these crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government like to talk a big game about law and order; they like to beat their chests a bit about law and order. But we know that behind closed doors there have been savage cuts to the Australian Federal Police. In fact, in the 2018-19 budget, the government cut the AFP's core Federal Police work by $139 million over the coming four years. And at Senate estimates this year the AFP commissioner confirmed that he will have to cut a massive 567 AFP personnel over the forward estimates because of this government's cuts to their budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that last year the government also threatened the pay and conditions of AFP officers. Even the most robust legislation that gives our law enforcement agencies the tools to be able to deal with the scourge of serious and organised crime and the threat that it has to the wellbeing of Australiansâ€”even with the best legislationâ€”we can't make up for the cuts that this government has made to our law enforcement agencies and to our law enforcement capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that our law enforcement agencies here in Australia do a wonderful job. They do the best that they can with the resources that they're given. They comprise some very dedicated men and women who give their lives for the protection of all Australiansâ€”who give their lives to fighting against serious and organised crime. Last week, my husband, who works in law enforcement, and I visited Mercy College and spoke to some of the year 11s and 12s there who have an interest in taking up a career in law enforcement. We gave them a bit of a career-counselling session, I might say. To see these young people, who also have an aspiration to become part of our law enforcement framework here in Australia and to join a law enforcement agency, was really quite heartening. I think we spoke to them for about two hours, and they had many questions about how they could forge a career in law enforcement. It was very heartening just to see that there are a number of young people who wish to start a career in law enforcement. I do hope that the government takes heed of what we have been saying on this side with regard to cuts to our law enforcement capability and capacity, because it will also impact on the future of law enforcementâ€”particularly on the capacity of law enforcement to attract and retain young people, whoâ€”as I've seen and as my husband saw when we went and spoke to these people at Mercy Collegeâ€”have the hunger, desire and aspiration to contribute to Australia's law enforcement capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, of course, supports our law enforcement agencies and the important work that they do. On this side, we are committed to ensuring that Australia maintains its strong and effective laws to combat serious and organised crime. The establishment of this national scheme plays a critical role in that; it plays a critical control in crime prevention and it plays a critical role in ensuring justice in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I mentioned earlier, thus far we have only New South Wales signed up to the regime. So I think it is a little too early to tell just how truly cooperative this national scheme will be. And, as I mentioned earlier, I know that other states will be waiting and watching, too. We'd like to see better cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth in this regard, and we'd like to see the government work better with the states, and to explain to the House why it has managed to secure the support of only New South Wales for this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to watching with interest the future of this scheme and, hopefully, a future of cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth that will allow our law enforcement agencies to tackle serious and organised crime and that gives them those capabilities. But I also look forward to the day when the government fully resources and funds our Federal Police and our federal agencies, as well as our state agencies, to be able to carry out the work that they need to do to continue the amazing work that they do in fighting crime in Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I rise in support of the Unexplained Wealth Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. AUSTRAC has estimated that crime generates between $2.8 billion and $6.3 billion every year. Depriving criminals of their wealth is a key element in discouraging and combating serious and organised crime. As a barrister who, once upon a time, used to practise in criminal law, I know that the best way to stop crime is to disincentivise it. To be able to take the proceeds of crime away from criminalsâ€”particularly, from organised criminalsâ€”is a terrific way of stopping them in their tracks, and certainly a way of giving them something to ponder about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that organised crime flourishes in places such as casinos, and, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, you might be aware that I've spoken in this place on many occasions about my opposition to the construction of a casino on the Sunshine Coast, one that the mayor of the Sunshine Coast, Mark Jamieson, wanted to see built in Maroochydore. I, with the assistance of 6,500 locals on the Sunshine Coast, fought tooth and nail against the building of a casino on the Sunshine Coast, because we, Sunshine Coast locals, know that, if a casino was ever built on our beautiful stretch of the Earth, it would have, absolutely, a significant, detrimental impact on the way that we lead our lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A casino would be like a magnet to organised crime, because casinos enable organised criminals to launder money, whether it's drug money or money gained through other types of offences, such as extortionâ€”all the sorts of offences that organised crime gets involved with. Casinos enable them to launder that money: to turn it into gambling chips and convert it back into cashâ€”to wash it. They clean that drug money, that money that they obtained through crimeâ€”those ill-gotten gains. So one of the best ways that we can stop organised crime, in my view, is by restricting the business of casinos. And that is why I fought so hard to ensure that a casino does not happen on the Sunshine Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, it has been estimated that more than a billion dollars in total in drug syndicate money passed through Crown Casino in Melbourne between 2002 and 2012. Police raids on major drug syndicates in Melbourne saw more than $1.2 million in casino chips confiscated in 2014 alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to announce that the Labor state government in Queensland has finally, after a great deal of persuasion and arm-bending, come out and indicated that they will not grant a casino licence for the Sunshine Coast. This is a terrific win for Sunshine Coast locals, because we know it will stop, or certainly put the brakes on, organised crime on the Sunshine Coast. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Organised crime in Queensland is most often associated with bikies on the Gold Coast but, unfortunately, the Sunshine Coast is not immune. In 2016 and 2017 Caloundra was the fourth worst suburb for ice use between Gympie and Strathpine, according to the Queensland department of child safety. According to the vice-president of the Sunshine Coast Local Medical Association, Dr Wayne Herdy, throughout 2017 the incidence of doctors treating acute crises caused by ice use on the Sunshine Coast doubled. Most GPs are dealing with at least two of these crises every week, and Dr Herdy expects this problem to increase by another 50 per cent this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My daughter works as a nurse at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. She sometimes tells me stories of young men coming into hospital absolutely charged up with ice and how these men can be almost uncontrollable. It is a real scourge on our community. The Health Retreat, a rehabilitation facility in Maleny owned by Francis McLachlan, suggests that ice is as readily available and cheap as a pizza on the Sunshine Coast. This ice comes, more often than not, from organised criminals operating on the coast. Often they have links to wider criminal organisations nationwide. In July 2018 Queensland police seized more than $1 million in illicit drugs, including cocaine, MDMA and ice, and arrested 28 people on 110 charges following the targeting of a sophisticated Sunshine Coast crime syndicate. This group had links with others in Sydney. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Preventing a casino on the Sunshine Coast will help prevent money laundering on a local level and will discourage the further growth of criminal organisations. At a national level, this legislation before us will give us extra tools to ensure that organised crime does not pay. The scheme of the bill will provide a national approach to target unexplained wealth, enabling all participating jurisdictions to work together to effectively deprive these criminals of their wealth, irrespective of the jurisdiction in which they operate. It will mean that instead of what is currently in placeâ€”a patchwork of orders that would otherwise be sought separately by the Commonwealth and, sometimes, state and territory authoritiesâ€”a single unexplained wealth order could be used to target a national criminal syndicate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the law currently stands, Commonwealth orders can only be used in relation to a Commonwealth offence, an international offence or a state offence with a federal aspect, excluding a large proportion of organised crime activities. This bill will expand that arrangement to all offences referred by the state and territory jurisdictions. The bill will also expand the range of powers available to state and territory jurisdictions, to help them work together with the Commonwealth to be more effective in their investigations. It'll give access to an individual's or an organisation's financial information. That is absolutely vital to identify whether they have illicit wealth. Under the bill, law enforcement agencies in participating jurisdictions will be able to apply for production orders or issue notices to financial institutions under the Proceeds of Crime Act. These compel the production of information or documents to investigators. The supply of that information has to be done within 14 days. To protect the public, participating jurisdictions will be subject to the oversight of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, and will be required to report to the minister annually on the use of these provisions. The report will be tabled in parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also expand access to Commonwealth-intercepted telecommunications information for unexplained wealth matters. Currently, this information can be legally gathered under exceptional circumstances and used by the Commonwealth, but it cannot be shared with other jurisdictions working on another case or even the same case. Under this bill, this sharing will be permitted where the information has been gathered. While providing these benefits, the bill also ensures that the state's unexplained wealth regimes are not undermined. The Commonwealth's unexplained wealth orders will only apply to offences which are referred to the Commonwealth by the states themselves. This will ensure that the Commonwealth never ends up with more control over state offences than the states do themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the proposed intergovernmental agreement on the national cooperative scheme on unexplained wealth, which accompanies this bill, contains provisions which ensure that any overlap between operations can be quickly resolved. This system will require the states to sign up, if they want to be involved, for it to be truly effective. Negotiations with the states have been ongoing since 2014, and the government is bringing forward this legislation now because it wants to ensure that jurisdictions that are eager to join the scheme can do so as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes an incentive for states to sign up. The bill will lower the threshold of a contribution that must be made by a jurisdiction for that jurisdiction to receive an equal share of the forfeit property. The scheme recognises all contributions, not just significant ones, including providing intelligence of relevance, securing the original conviction that leads to the wealth recovery, or providing the offences relied on by the Commonwealth in undertaking the recovery. Under the proposed intergovernmental agreement on the national cooperative scheme on unexplained wealth, states will be required, in return, to inform the Commonwealth and other jurisdictions about operations or any legislative changes which may impact on them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, so far most of the states have not signed up to this system. In particular and of worthy note is the jurisdiction of Queensland. It has not confirmed at this stage that it will participate. The Queensland state Labor government does not, unfortunately, have a good track record of participating in national law enforcement regimes which combat criminal organisations. I refer specifically to the Trade Union Joint Police Taskforce, which has been set up by the Commonwealth to investigate criminal offences that have been allegedly committed by trade unions or their officials. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that some people within the trade union movement, particularly in the CFMEU, are acting and have been acting illegally for a number of years, and yet the Queensland state government refused to sign up to this Trade Union Joint Police Taskforce. This is a blight on the Queensland state government. It is an example of the Queensland state government looking after their union mates, because they know, just as the Leader of the Opposition here knows, that they owe their jobs to the CFMMEUâ€”</span>

                    </a>  You ought to try saying it very quickly! They ought to make it very, very clear that no longer will they take their electoral donations. The Labor Party must distance itself from the CFMMEU and no longer take electoral donations from them. Let's face it: the money that has been extorted from hardworking Australians by the CFMMEU is unfortunately being channelled back in to support this Labor Party and the Labor parties throughout all the states. It is an absolute travesty. The Leader of the Opposition here should distance himself from it. He should disown the CFMMEU. In fact, the CFMMEU should be deregisteredâ€”make no mistake. I would strongly encourage the Queensland government to get involved in this important initiative to help us combat the bikie gangs on the Gold Coast and the drug syndicates driving ice throughout Queensland. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family violence and child abuse are unacceptable and require a strong legislative response. The Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2018 will enhance the capacity of the justice system to provide effective outcomes for vulnerable Australians who are experiencing family violence. In particular, the bill will strengthen the powers of courts to protect victims of family violence, and facilitate the resolution of family law matters by state and territory courts in appropriate cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth, states and territories have made shared commitments under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022, which sets an ambitious agenda for addressing the scourge of family violence affecting many Australians. Under action 5.1 of the Third Action Plan of the national plan, governments have agreed to implement supported recommendations of the Family Law Council's 2015 and 2016 reports on families with complex needs and the intersection of the family law and child protection systems. The bill implements four of those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also responds directly to calls for reform from Victoria's 2016 Royal Commission into Family Violence, the Australian and New South Wales Law Reform Commissions' 2010 report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Family </span><span style="font-style:italic;">violenceâ€”a n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ational </span><span style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">egal </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">esponse</span>, and the Victorian state coroner's 2015 findings of the inquest into the death of Luke Geoffrey Batty. This bill demonstrates the seriousness with which the government has taken the findings of these inquiries, and its commitment to improving how the federal, state and territory justice systems help vulnerable families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will reduce the need for families to interact with multiple courts across these systems to address their legal needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, families are often required to navigate state or territory magistrates' courts and children's courts, and the federal family law courts. Understandably, this can cause confusion, delay and prolonged exposure to risks of violence, particularly for families with complex needs such as family violence, mental health and substance abuse issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">State and territory magistrates' courts already have a range of powers to make, vary and suspend family law orders under the Family Law Act. However, they don't always do this and, when they do, it can result in inconsistent state and federal orders. This can create uncertainty and also increase risk for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also provide for an increased total property value, under which state magistrates' courts can hear contested family law property matters without both parties' consent. The current property value of $20,000 has not been updated since 1988. The bill will allow a higher value to be prescribed in regulations, with the flexibility of prescribing different values for different states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing this value will reduce the cost, pressure and risk for vulnerable families who are dealing with legal matters across multiple courts. State and territory magistrates' courts exercising limited property and parenting jurisdiction will enable vulnerable victims of family violence to achieve some measure of economic independence without having to initiate separate proceedings in a family law court. This can accelerate their recovery process by facilitating earlier financial stability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will allow relevant state and territory courts, such as children's courts, to be prescribed so that they can exercise family law parenting jurisdiction. This will provide children's court judicial officers with additional tools to make orders that support the best interests of children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family law orders will be a useful tool for the children's court, where they can provide greater certainty to children and their carers. For example, where a matter is already before the children's court a family law parenting order may give a protective carer, such as a grandparent, greater certainty about ongoing care arrangements for a child. It will also negate the need to institute future proceedings in a family law court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does not intend that state and territory courts become the primary fora for resolving family law disputes. The amendments in this bill are designed to give state and territory courts greater flexibility to hear family law matters where parties are already appearing for a related state or territory proceeding. State and territory courts will retain their existing powers to transfer proceedings to the federal family law courts in the circumstances provided for in the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support this bill, the Australian government has funded the National Judicial College of Australia to deliver training to state and territory judicial officers about family law parenting and property matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has delayed introducing criminal offences for breaches of family law injunctions made for personal protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government takes the safety of family violence victims seriously, and remains committed to the policy intention of the proposed offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in order to progress passage of the remaining measures in the bill to deliver effective outcomes for Australian families experiencing family violence, the government has removed this measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will further improve the efficacy and protective function of the Family Law Act by ensuring that judges exercising family law jurisdiction do so expeditiously, and that the information children receive from a court is appropriate and would not expose them to further details of family violence. The bill includes measures to avoid inconsistencies between family violence orders and family law orders, which can lead to confusion and increased risk for victims. It will also strengthen and codify the power of the family law courts to dismiss unmeritorious cases and proceedings that are frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will improve the justice system's capacity to produce timely and effective resolutions to matters involving family violence. It will respond directly to expert recommendations to address the needs of vulnerable families and support more effective interaction between family law and the state and territory family violence and child protection systems. The measures in this bill exemplify the government's commitment to ensuring that the family law system will protect victims of family violence and hold perpetrators accountable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  While the government tears itself apart, let's not forget the damage they're doing all around them. Last week they landed their awful, moth-eaten version of the national marine park plan. After five years of delay, this lot has acted to remove 50 per cent of the marine protected areas from Labor's networkâ€”that's 40 million hectares. It is the largest backwards step in ocean protection that's ever been taken by any government, any time anywhere. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It means protections are removed for the Coral Sea, for the Diamantina Fracture Zone and for the Perth Canyon. It does away with marine protection in far offshore zones that can now only be fished by supertrawlers. Labor's national network of marine protection areas was formed on the basis of the science, and it involved painstaking consultation with stakeholders and the wider Australian community. It was supported by 97 per cent of recreational fishers. When the Department of the Environment sought submissions on the government's plan to wreck Labor's marine network, they received 82,000 submissions calling for it to be left alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national network of marine protected areas that Labor created in partnership with the Australian community established a world-leading framework to ensure our oceans continue to be the life-blood of this planet. That network is critical to maintaining the incredible biodiversity of our oceans and it is critical to the health of our fisheries. That is why Labor is committed to reintroducing that network in full. The only way to make that happen, though, is to change this moth-eaten government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I rise to note a crisis rally being staged by Speak Up 4 Water next Monday in Deniliquin in my electorate of Farrer. It is in response to the growing impact of drought. In this case we're not praying for rain; we're praying for common sense. Irrigators in the mid-Murray region are fighting for water currently in storage for future environmental flows to instead be used to save dying winter crops. That water can also be used to finish off fodder for drought-stricken stock across the rest of New South Wales and Queensland.  The plan is to borrow this water up to 100 gigalitres. </span>

Among the many showing support for the proposal is one Finley producer who says all the dryland wheat he has is going to die unless rain or watering occurs in the next fortnight. Some is already falling over, in fact. </span>

Water for the environment and agriculture is a necessary but often conflicted consequence of the basin plan, but it is a problem that my constituents want urgently solved.</span>

This is a government gripped by chaos, hopelessly divided and in a state of panic. You're consumed by yourselves; we've seen it all today and over the past weeks. You're consumed with saving your own jobs, and the Prime Minister himself is doing anything to save his job. I'd give him 11 out of 10, maybe even a 15 out of 10, for backflips; it's an exceptional piece of work he's done this week on the NEG. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government is difficult. It's hard. It's a challenging job to look out for the interests of all the people that live in this country. But I'll tell you what: I've never seen a more hapless, hopeless bunch that evidently are not up to the challenge of governing Australia for the good of all the people that live here. Look at what they do: they back in the banks and their bad behaviour. They fail to save penalty rates. They give big companies big tax cuts. They attack industry super funds and the workers of this country that join in the great trade union movement, while failing to support a royal commission into the bad behaviour of banks for something over 600 days. They failed to protect vulnerable people and support the private member's bill on payday lending restrictions that was their own legislation. They brought it to the House first. It got scuttled back somewhere else and it took members on this side of the chamber to introduce that legislation again, but they've failed to support it. If you want a better country run by a better government, elect Labor, and Bill Shorten as the Prime Minister of this country.</span>

On 18 August I attended two commemorative events for Vietnam veterans. Firstly, I acknowledge the efforts of the Huskisson RSL Sub-Branch, because they had to move the event from Voyager Park to indoors due to the raging winds. Later that day a fairly large crowd gathered at Walsh Park for that commemoration. Clive Poulton, a life member of the Vietnam Veterans Association, took care of the whole event. TS Shoalhaven Navy Cadets were present, as was the Air Force Cadets unit. They made up the catafalque party. As the sun set and the flags flapped in the breeze, the poignant moment was complete with the bugle playing of Peter Williams. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the previous week, Kioloa's mobile phone tower was finally switched on. After five years of trying to find an acceptable site, the ANU campus board suggested they act as a host. This solved the longstanding problem. Well done to Barry Ellis and Justin and Mary Stanwick for their efforts at finally getting a resolution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should mention the Kiama Artisan Food Festival, which was helped and supported by the federal government with a grant of $16,000 for the Kiama Show Society. Visiting chef Mark Olive, otherwise known as the black olive, supervised a great dinner. He sourced the ingredients locallyâ€”within 50 kilometres. He was a thoroughly great guy. We raised over $1,800 for Rotary's drought appeal and everybody thought it was a great night.</span>

There's great food and there are awesome people. It's open and friendly. The lifestyle's fantastic. Even our storms are incredible. Many people sometimes get a wrong perception of the Northern Territory because we're a bit laid back and enjoy life, but it's an amazing place full of all sorts of opportunities and possibilities. I want to reflect on the Northern Territory government's rebranding efforts that have just been announced. The title for the rebrand is 'The Territory, Boundless Possible'. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rebranding was the result of thousands of conversations with people across Australia and with local and international business leaders. The Territory is a place of boundless possibilities for those who want to grasp those opportunities and are willing to work for them. But what we need is a federal government that can invest in the Northern Territory. At the momentâ€”with whoever ends up running this rabble on the other sideâ€”we need to see that commitment. It's been 490 days since an MOU was established for the Darwin City Deal, so it's about time whoever's the Prime Minister comes up and signs it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  On Saturday the member for Brand and I met in solidarity with Australian Workers' Union members working for Alcoa in Western Australia who have been trying to negotiate a new enterprise agreement. On Friday, around 1,500 workers from the mines and refineries across Kwinana, Pinjarra Waroona and Wagerup voted to strike indefinitely, waiting for Alcoa to come back to the negotiating table. These workers aren't fighting for more money. Instead, they've accepted a pay freeze. They're fighting for some job security in the increasingly unpredictable jobs market they operate in. Some of these guys have worked at Alcoa for longer than I have been alive. They are dedicated employees who, despite accepting the removal of minimum staffing levels, are being placed at risk by an employer who still wants to force redundancies while maintaining that there won't be anyâ€”all of this while the workers are mining and refining our bauxite for the benefit of an American company. It is the antithesis of good-faith bargaining. Alcoa have applied for their existing enterprise agreement to be cancelled. These workers have been negotiating with, effectively, a gun held to their head. Frankly, this is just another example of how it is time for us to change the rules when it comes to industrial relations in this country. The community is right behind them. They are offering union families discounted fuel and delivering food to the picket sites. They are showing that, in the Australian public's eye, behaviour by this multinational resources company is unacceptable. And they are demonstrating what we have always known: we are stronger together.</span>

To mark the occasion, I invited the Minister for Aged Care to visit Caloundra last Friday. We took part in the Sunshine Coast's Senior Care and Lifestyle Expo and visited retirement communities and aged-care residences all over Fisher. There are around 40,000 people over the age of 60 in my electorate. Every day they prove that, just because you're getting older, it doesn't mean you can't make a major contribution to our community. In businesses, sporting clubs, community groups, schools and healthcare facilities, we have a wealth of corporate knowledge and experience embodied in our over-60s. As one of the people at the Expo on Friday said, 'Don't ask Google, ask Granny.' I thought that was the take-home from the whole expo. You just can't beat experience. If we want to succeed, we should do everything we can to tap into that experience and ensure that our seniors continue to be given the opportunity to contribute to every facet of our community life. I'm grateful to the minister for visiting Fisher and listening to my constituent's ideas on how we can make that a reality. Congratulations to Gavin Williams, Gayle Hartshorn and the team at Garden Financial Services for putting on the Sunshine Coast expo.</span>

No wonder we saw such outrage when the federal government handed over nearly half a million dollars to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation without a tender process. Sadly, in Tasmania we're no strangers to deals between government and business being done behind closed doors. That's why members in my community are understandably concerned about a $2.95 million grant from the federal government for a private development on the South Coast Track. The only information the government will release is a single paragraph on a website. Surely, when nearly $3 million of taxpayers' funds are involved, the federal government must be up-front about how the money was approved and exactly what it's for, regardless of the merits or otherwise of the proponent. Just as surely, any development in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area needs to be scrutinised extra carefully to ensure it would comply with stringent social and environmental criteria. The community can live with things they don't like if they're sure they've come about by a trustworthy process. The reef and Tasmanian tourism are obviously both important, so it's regrettable such dark clouds hang over the examples that I've mentioned here today.</span>

Every year on Vietnam Veterans Day, 18 August, we pause and we reflect on the service and the bravery of those Australian men and women who served us during the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War was Australia's longest military engagement of the 20th century, with almost 60,000 Australians serving during a decade of conflict between 1962 and 1972. The Battle of Long Tan was one of the fiercest battles fought by Australian soldiers during the war.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday I attended a Vietnam veterans memorial service at Long Beach on the Central Coast in honour of the sacrifice of those who served in the Vietnam War. The streets were busy for the veterans' march as the parade moved through Ocean View Road, Memorial Avenue and finally through to The Esplanade at Ettalong Beach. The march was followed by a touching ceremony at the war memorial on the foreshore. I'd like to pay tribute to the guest speaker, Lieutenant Colonel Don Tate, for his moving words acknowledging the courage and sacrifice of those men and women who bravely served our nation during the Vietnam War. Every year, the Vietnam Veterans, Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association of Australia Central Coast Sub-Branch organises this significant memorial to give all local people the chance to remember and give thanks to those who have served our nation. I would like to thank the Central Coast sub-branch for putting together the service. To Dr Stephen Karsai, Alan Ball, Wayne Jennings, Eric Daniel, Ken Rowe, Ted Crawley and everyone who assisted on the day: thank you for all you do for our community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They are directionless. All they really care about are their own jobs. I read today in the newspaper that backbenchers were concerned that they could lose their jobs because they have mortgages and kids that they're worried about. What about every other Australian? What about every other worker who currently is stuck in insecure work? What about the women who are relying on penalty rates but have had their penalty rates cut? This Liberal-National government refuses to back in those workers and restore the cuts to penalty rates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve a government that will stand up for them, that will get on and do the hard work, that will bring in the reforms and that will improve lives and things in their homes and communities. There's a lot in this country that needs to be tackled. There are issues with energy prices, issues in workplaces and issues in the community when it comes to long waiting lists. People who are trying to get their pension are stuck waiting because this government won't employ people to work at Centrelink to do the processing and answer the phones. This government should acknowledge that they've failed, call an election and let the Australian people elect a government that will serve them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Last Monday I was thrilled to support an incredibly generous initiative that saw a convoy of 23 road trains leave WA bound for drought-stricken New South Wales. The cargo was 2,300 hay bales weighing more than 1,200 tonnes. Their objective was to provide relief to 200 drought-stricken farms by supplying enough hay to feed a thousand cows or 20,000 sheep for 23 weeks. Their destination was Condobolin in the Central West region of New South Wales, a journey of more than 3,500 kilometres. As the convoy rolled across Australia, roadhouses put on complimentary meals for drivers who had volunteered their time and the use of the trucks. When the hay was distributed to farmers from Condobolin, Tullamore, Tottenham, Nymagee and Lake Cargelligo, many struggled to hold back tears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The charity behind the project, the Rapid Relief Team, said that after Western Australians realised how desperate the drought situation was, it took just two weeks to round up volunteers and $600,000 worth of hay. I was glad to be able to help by expediting the necessary state government permits for the road trains to roll through regional WA. I'd like to thank all those who donated goods and services to make Operation Drought Relief a success. These included: Mammoth Equipment &amp; Exhausts, Great Southern Fuels, Dallcon, Auspan, Duraquip and Wheatbelt Steel, who all supplied trucks, diesel and drivers; LiftRite for the use of a Manitou telehandler; Glenvar for a trailer-load of hay; IOR for 15,000 litres of diesel; and last, but by no means least, Alan Richardson, director of Commodity Ag, for managing the logistics and making me aware of this important drought relief initiative. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Australia is in the grip of one of its most severe droughts ever. There are 60 bushfires burning across New South Wales at the moment. Workers and families are struggling with cost-of-living pressure and they've had their penalty rates cut. Pensioners and small business can't afford to switch the electricity on because they can't afford their burgeoning bills. What is the approach of this Turnbull government? They're more concerned about themselves. Chaos reigns within this government. They are more concerned with the civil war going on in the Liberal Party and the revenge that's being extracted by the member for Warringah than the interests of the Australian people.</span>

The fifth generation of their energy plan has been abandoned by the Prime Minister and this government. There are no plans to transition to cleaner fuels and boost renewables. There are no plans to deal with the clogged roads and infrastructure bottlenecks that we face in our major cities. There are no plans to invest in our schools and universities, and they're cutting funding from health care and other areas. They have no plan for Australia. They are only concerned about themselves, whereas we on the Labor side are concerned about and are listening to the Australian people. We've consulted with them. We've developed plans to ensure housing is affordable. We've developed plans to ensure we get electricity prices down and we transition to cleaner fuels. Only Labor is listening to the Australian people. Only Labor has a plan for the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There are hundreds of volunteers every weekend. Well done. Keep sharing your energy for the game with our young women. The volunteers are the cogs that keep the Brighton Soccer Club moving.

In fact, there are over 14,000 people like them nationally who are in exactly the same position. They are people like Romano Laurie. He's 81 years of age. He's worked with his hands, physically, in hard work all his life. He lives alone and he wants to stay in the place that he builtâ€”his family home that he's lived in all his lifeâ€”but he has been told that he has to wait for over 12 months to get the aged-care package that he needs.</span>

They don't get that this government is so preoccupied with itself that it cannot focus on the needs of people like Romano and the over 14,000 other pensioners and old people around the country. My question to the Prime Minister is: when are you going to stop focusing on yourself and start focusing on the needs of elder Australians?</span>

Whether they are trying to drop their kids off at school, get to work or just drive through Berwick, it's an absolute nightmare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2007, when John Howard was the Prime Minister, we made a commitment to build a rail underpass or overpassâ€”a grade separation. In 2010, I made the same election commitment for a grade separation. Do you know what happened? Sadly, Labor came into power. What did they do? They didn't fix it up, did they? They didn't fix it up; they just widened it. We now have this mess because, when Labor gets into government, they cannot get the job done and they cannot fix the roads up. Clyde Road is a mess for one reason only: the Labor Party got into government. Now Daniel Andrews wants to build a sky rail there. The residents of La Trobe say no to the sky rail. We want an underpass. We want to make sure residents of La Trobe get what they deserve, and they deserve proper roads and proper rails. You would never get that under a Labor government at a state level or a federal level.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I rise to inform the House of an important development. On Sunday, the Leader of the House updated his register of interests to include two tickets to the Adelaide Festival's performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span>. Was the Leader of the House there to learn from Shakespeare's classic tale of ambition, betrayal, revenge, or crippling indecisionâ€”or was he there to offer a few tips of his own? And one wonders which way the sweet prince of Sturt cast his vote today. To be Wentworth, or to be Dickson; that is the question. And, as the restless ghosts of old kings walk the battlements up there on the backbench, uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as much as Shakespeare could pen a mighty tragedy, we also know that he enjoyed a good farce and a little bit of slapstick. That must be the only explanation for the reports we now hear today that the member for Flinders is now a candidate for deputy leader! And, apparently, he is desperate for the job. But, alas, poor Yorick! This was not to be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play at 4,000 lines and nearly four hours. Sadly, the Liberal Party civil war has been going for five years, but Australians are still waiting for the curtain.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  The winter break was a great time to catch up with local companies that are going above and beyond in Bonner. One of these is the Port of Brisbane company. Just recently, the Port of Brisbane recognised outstanding local organisations for their work in the community through a range of grants. They have also been working on a pilot project with the goal of improving safety across the entire road freight industry in Australia. The Port of Brisbane's annual Community Grants Program is a fantastic initiative. These grants are awarded to local and not-for-profit organisations for innovative projects that benefit the wider community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Port of Brisbane CEO, Roy Cummins, for inviting me to their recent awards ceremony. It was an incredible event, bringing together an incredible group of people. Together, these people are making such a difference in our community, and it was great to meet them and hear about their work. Quite a few of them were familiar faces, and I wasn't surprised that their organisations were awarded grants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of them was Nyree Mannion. Nyree started the Make it Home Safely initiative three years ago, to educate young people about safe driving. Their Port of Brisbane grant will go towards a new car to support Make it Home Safely's learn-to-drive program.</span>

Labor, on the other hand, wants higher taxes, higher energy prices, less employment, less investment, slower economic growth and lower wages.

                  </a>  We've seen them coming down in the last quarter. We hauled the big retailers in and demanded that they deliver a fair deal for their customers, and they contacted hundreds of thousands of their customers, told them they were on the wrong deal and gave them the opportunity to get onto the right one. Customers were able to save hundreds of dollars, and took that up. What we've also done is ensured that the companies that own the poles and wires are not able to keep on gaming the system to increase the rate at which they charge customers for that investment. We've succeeded in doing that by removing the ability to keep on appealing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have further to go. We've got more to do. And so, 15 months ago, the Treasurer commissioned the consumer watchdog, the ACCC, to look rigorously, deeply and thoroughly into this problem of high retail electricity prices. The commissioner's report has recommended a number of vital measures which we are taking up. We're going to take up his suggestion of directing the Energy Regulator to create a new benchmark price, a new default price. That'll be monitored by the ACCC and the regulator to ensure that savings are being passed on to customers. That means that, instead of people falling onto standing offers which are often very, very high and result in them paying hundreds of dollars more than they need to, there'll be one default offer. We are advised by the ACCC this will save 1.2 million consumers up to $416 a year and small and medium businesses up to just under $1,500 a year. That is the result of a report by the ACCC which we commissioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also going to ensure that the ACCC has the measures and the means to ensure the big companies do the right thing by their customers. We are prepared to have them ordered to divest parts of their businesses in order to stop cartels and the monopolistic behaviour that is jacking up electricity prices and not protecting the interests of the consumers, the people, that the companies are meant to serve.</span>

                  </a>  When the Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity to vote for lower taxes, he voted for higher taxes. When he's had the opportunity to support lower energy prices, he's continued to opt for higher energy prices. When he had the opportunity to support stronger economic growth, he failed to do so. Having in previous parliaments advocated lower business taxes, he now opposes any reduction in business taxes. The Leader of the Opposition has failed to deliver the fundamental point that an opposition leader should deliver, which is an alternative economic agenda. He has none. His plan is higher prices, higher taxes, lower wages and fewer jobs. That's the Labor way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today Australia has a Prime Minister in name onlyâ€”a Prime Minister without power and a Prime Minister without policies. This is an appalling outcome for the nation. Unbelievablyâ€”after yesterday, when we saw how divided the government wereâ€”they are more divided today than they were yesterday. The conduct of this narcissistic government is both shocking and selfish, and undervalues the Australian people. This House should vote for no confidence because the Prime Minister has no authority, no power and no policies. The reason for that sits behind him. If nearly half of his own government do not want him to be the Prime Minister of Australia, why should the rest of Australia have to put up with him?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The case for no confidence in the Prime Minister has five points to it. First, if the Prime Minister's own party does not want himâ€”and today nearly half of his party voted against him remaining Prime Ministerâ€”why should the parliament put up with him? The second reason, of course, as we saw yesterday, is the dismal paralysis on policies to lower energy prices and to tackle climate change. They cannot pass the parliament because this Prime Minister does not have the confidence of all of his backbench. Thirdly, this Prime Minister has never seen a fight for his principles that he hasn't squibbed and he has notoriously poor judgement, which his backbench and frontbench are willing to tell any journalist, anonymously, at any time. Fourthlyâ€”and even more importantly than the first three reasonsâ€”this Prime Minister and his government are ignoring the real challenges of the Australian people, and it means we can have no confidence in him. Finally, the reason why this parliament should have no confidence in the Prime Minister is there are divisions at the heart of this government which cannot be papered over by simply changing the salesman for this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the first case for why we should have no confidence in the Prime Minister, we saw remarkable scenes today. Yesterday the former Minister for Home Affairs said he supported the Prime Ministerâ€”until today. But, more than just his challenge to the Prime Minister, there is the fact that another 34 of his colleagues, within 24 hours of the Prime Minister spilling his own position, wanted him gone. This government has lost the will to live. Indeed, what is more significant is that some of the people who voted against the Prime Minister still sit in the executive of this parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today it is clear that we have a Prime Minister in name only. He is a Prime Minister without power. He is a Prime Minister without policies. He scraped home at the last election with no authority and no agenda, only the ability to respond to events. Today we have seen an appalling outcome for the nation. It is unbelievable that, even though the Prime Minister said yesterday that he could not take any action on energy prices because any single member of the government could veto it, today they've highlighted that they are even more divided. This is a government whose conduct is selfish and shocking. It is a narcissistic government consumed by its own jobs and its own struggles, and it's forgotten the people of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The case for no confidence in this Prime Minister can be made through five arguments. The first is: if the Prime Minister's own party doesn't want him, why on earth should the parliament put up with him? Second, we have dismal paralysis on the energy crisis which is affecting Australia, driving up prices and carbon pollution, and no government can retain the confidence of this parliament if they tell us they can't even advance legislation to drive energy prices down. The third proposition for why we should have no confidence in this Prime Minister is that the hallmark of his prime ministership is that, whenever his beliefs meet the opposition of his backbench, he surrenders his belief. This parliament should not put up with a Prime Minister only interested in surviving in his own job. He stands for nothing and fights for nothing except his own job. His notorious poor judgement is a hallmark which any government backbencher is happy to tell you about at length anonymously. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, more important than the first three reasons, there is the fourth. Australians have got real issues, and this government is not addressing them. No amount of valedictory speeches from the Prime Minister can correct that wrong. Finally, the reason we should have no confidence in this Prime Minister is that your government is hopelessly divided, and it isn't even just about you anymore, Prime Minister. The Liberal government in this country cannot agree with each other on fundamental issues, and a divided government cannot run this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the first propositionâ€”why we should have no confidence in the Prime Ministerâ€”if the Prime Minister has nearly half of his MPs wanting to change the Prime Minister today, how on earth should all of us have confidence in him? When you add together the 35 dissidentsâ€”soon to be a majority, I suspectâ€”the 69 Labor MPs and possibly the crossbenchers, a clear majority of Australia does not want this Prime Minister to be the Prime Minister. We have no confidence in him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice that, before question time, the member for Dicksonâ€”who at least had the integrity to go to the backbench because he couldn't support the Prime Minister on the frontbenchâ€”did his job interview. But what was tellingâ€”and why we should have no confidence in this Prime Ministerâ€”was that he was asked five times if he was going to challenge again and he had all the good reasons in the world not to answer that question. So I say to Australians who are shocked by the turmoil in this government: the turmoil is not over until the member for Dickson has the scalp of the Prime Minister hanging from his belt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is also telling is that, for the 35 MPs who voted to change the Prime Minister, some of them sit on the frontbench. We had the Minister for Health desperate to replace the Minister for Foreign Affairs until he discovered that the numbers weren't there. Obviously, he's a lot tougher when it comes to swearing at grandmas than when it comes to challenging the foreign minister. We've got the member for Deakin, the campaign manager for the member for Dickson, sitting quietly there as an assistant minister. Your best days are ahead of you, Member for Deakin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you can only conclude by the cowardice of frontbench rebels against the Prime Minister that the Prime Minister's weakness is infectious. At least those who voted against the Prime Minister should have had the courage to say, 'We'll undermine the government from the backbench not from the frontbench of this government'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said there was a second reason why we have no confidence in this Prime Minister. The handling of the energy policy by this government alone is reason enough for this House to have no confidence. They've proposed that we should have, initially, an emissions intensity scheme. We know that the current Prime Minister had a view on that, and we said we were willing to talk about that. But, as soon as we came to the dance, the Prime Minister was dragged away by the right wing of his party. Then the Prime Minister rolled out the poor old clean energy target and the Chief Scientist to advocate it. That didn't last very long. Labor is prepared to be bipartisan. What we discovered is that, when it comes to energy policy, when the Prime Minister refers to 'bipartisanship', he means getting the two warring wings of his own party to agree. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we had the much-unloved National Energy Guaranteeâ€”NEG 1.0, NEG 2.0, NEG 3.0. This is a government whose energy policy is guided by the never-ending panic of a Prime Minister. The reason we have no confidence in the Prime Minister is that, if he's too weak to legislate policy, if he's too weak to fight for what he believes in, how on earth will we ever lower energy prices in this country? I do not accept that, when the Prime Minister announces 'mission accomplished' on energy prices, when he and his Treasurer and home affairs minister and potential contender for the Prime Minister's position announce that energy prices are coming down, go and talk to real Australians; they just don't agree with you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the real issueâ€”the third issue. We have a Prime Minister whose premiership of the position, his stewardship of the Prime Minister's position, has been marked from day one; he never fights for the principles he believes in. He never understands that when you appease your critics and when you surrender your principles, your critics come back and they want more and more, and now they just want your job. The critics in the Liberal Party and the conservatives can smell the weakness within the Prime Minister. They can sniff the weakness in the Prime Minister. They can see the vulnerability in this Prime Minister. No matter how many times the Prime Minister changes his views on climate change, no matter how many times he's changed his view on the republic, advocating now the morbid argument that Australia can't be a republic until the current Queen passes awayâ€”he keeps giving in. Let's remember his judgement on the banking royal commission. The Prime Minister has notorious poor judgement because he does not actually fight for anything he believes in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this Prime Minister rolled the previous Prime Minister, I thought that we would see a different kind of politics, that we would have a sensible form of politics. I thought my job would be harderâ€”I concede that. But I thought, at last, we could build a national consensus on climate change, on having an Australian head of state, on actually doing something to look after the middle class and working class of this country. But the Prime Minister, having obtained the highest office in the land, we've discovered, never fights for anything except his own job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, he has notoriously poor judgement. Only someone of Turnbullian genius could argue against a banking royal commission for the last two years. Only this government could have argued in favour of giving the states the right to have income tax powers so that there's double income tax in this country. Only this government could still hang on to the corporate tax cuts at this point in the electoral cycle. Here's a prediction: this Prime Minister is so afraid of people's reactions to him, he so craves positive polls, he so needs the approval of people, that he will drop the corporate tax cuts, because he never fights for anything he believes in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are real challenges facing the Australian people which deserve to be heard but which are getting neglected under this governmentâ€”under this narcissistic, selfish, self-obsessed government. Government MPsâ€”a few of them are yelling out interjectionsâ€”know that the people of Australia are more than frustrated with their conduct today. They know they have a government focused on themselves, and not on the people of Australia. There are real problems out there in Australian society. Wages are at a record low. I thought I was in a parallel universe last week when the Prime Minister said that wages are getting better. They are at record lows. If you don't believe me, ask the people who are not getting a pay rise in this country. They don't live like you. They don't live like the people in parliament. Many Australians have not had a pay rise. Many Australians have seen their conditions go back. We have many Australians in casual and part-time work. We have many Australians working in labour-hire jobs alongside permanent workers, yet the labour-hire workers are paid less. We have many Australians who feel the system is broken. By the way, the conduct of the government today would give them no reason for optimism that the system is not broken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other issues in this country which need to be addressed. One is the unacceptable blow-out in waiting lists for aged care. Look at the governmentâ€”they think they're so clever. Every day the waiting lists get longer. Then you've got to look at the general dismantling of our healthcare system under a government who'd rather give tax cuts to private health insurance companies than rein in the premiums they charge Australians. Then you look at our schools, our TAFE and our universities. This government is not properly funding schools. This government is not properly funding TAFE. This government is not properly funding universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the ranks of this government, some of them perhaps genuinely don't understand these issues. But what chance do some of the backbenchers have when they have a Prime Minister so out of touch, when they have a Prime Minister who gets up every day in question time and says how well things are going? Tell that to the farmers experiencing drought. Tell that to young people who can't get apprenticeships. Tell that to older Australians who can't get the aged-care assessments they need to get the support that they require so they can live their remaining years with dignity. And, of course, we've got to look at the mess they've made of child care. A quarter of Australian families are paying more for child care than they were before this Prime Minister was the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is not just the division and it is not just the fact that the government is out of touch with the real issues of Australians and so absorbed with themselves. To be fair to the Prime Minister, it's not all his fault alone. The problem is that the Liberal Party of Australia is not the Liberal Party they once were. It is riven by fundamental disagreements at the heart of the government. That is why the member for Dickson feels the need to speak up for the conservatives. That is why so many of the brave anonymous assassins of the Prime Minister over there say that this government is somehow not living up to conservative standards. This is a government at war with itself, and, as much as they may say it's not, as much as those in it say they are economic supermen making Australia better for all Australians, the fact of the matter is: this is a government that is desperate to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the backbench and brave members of the front bench: we know that, when you drop your silly corporate tax cuts, that is a battle won by Labor. But we know that war is not over. We are determined. The best way to stop corporate tax cuts in this country is to vote Labor at the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the way this government has pursued the ABC. The old Liberal Party, the party of Fraser and Menzies, would not have attacked the ABC. Now we have, in the job specification of the Minister for Communications, to be a serial complainant about the ABC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course we see the ongoing debates about school funding. The best way to look after the government schools, the Catholic schools and independent schools, is not to rob Peter to pay Paul but to properly fund all schools based upon need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is a government that loves to talk about a 'big stick'. In the game of question time bingo yesterday, this government had the big stick on energy companies and the big stick on banks. The problem is: at the same time, they're trying to legislate tax cuts for the very companies they say they're tough on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real problem in Australia at the moment is that this Prime Minister is simply not up to the job. And no amount of Mogadoned behaviour at press conferences after leadership changes can unmake this truth. The reality is, Prime Minister: you have 35 people behind you who, this morning, voted not to have you as their leader. And I predict: that number will get larger. Today, you may well have all the government members vote to have confidence in you, but doesn't that just show the parallel world to which this parliament has descended? This morning, 35 of your colleagues, who you thought were your great supporters, voted to do you in. And on Thursday, or in two weeks time, or after the next poll, which you worship so foolishly, what will then happen is: more of them will do you in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us be done with the dishonesty that this parliament has confidence in the Prime Minister. Your colleagues don't want you. You've exercised notoriously poor judgement, because you are as weak a Prime Minister as we've seen since Billy McMahon. You are a dismal failure when it comes to energy policy, telling us: it's not your fault; it's the fault of individual members of your government. You have no idea how the real people live. You are hopelessly out of touch with their views. And finally, and fundamentally, you lead a divided government. And nothing you can do will change that fact.</span>

He was prepared to exchange penalty rates for cleaners in return for a secret deal with the employer, with money going back to the union. This is a great leader, we're told! He wants to be Prime Minister. He voted against making payments between large companies and unions transparent. Can you believe that! He's actually in favour of secret and corrupting payments. He didn't want them to be banned. He didn't want the public to know, the members of unions to know, about itâ€”one deal after another, behind the backs of the men and women he was supposed to represent.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition doesn't seem to care that last year we had the largest jobs growth in Australia's history, the largest jobs growth in any single year, over 400,000 jobs. And we have economic growth which is now faster, higher, than any of the G7 economies. Economic management is a key priority for governments. There you are. Highest jobs growth, high economic growth and employment. We now have unemployment at its lowest level since November 2012. We want to see it lower and we want to see wages growth higher, but what we are doing is delivering stronger economic growth, more jobs and lower unemployment. What that will deliver, as the Reserve Bank was saying only today, is higher wages, and we are starting to see that movement in higher wages. It all comes from a stronger economy. That, we've been able to do at the same time as we have reduced taxes for Australians, Australian families. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TURNBULL:</span>
                  </a>  By 2024 we will see 94 per cent of Australians paying no more than 32Â½ cents on any extra dollar they earn. We also have succeeded, and this is a vital priority, in being able to bring down youth unemployment to its lowest level since April 2012. More than 57,000 young Australians found a job in the 12 months to July this year. That is, again, a reminder of what a strong economy does. You get more economic growth, more investment and more jobs. And the female participation rate is at record levels. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear from the Leader of the Opposition his complaints about economic management. Stronger economic growth than any of the G7 economies, record jobs growth, the lowest unemployment rate since 2012, the lowest youth unemployment rate since 2012 and the highest female participation rateâ€”that is what you get from a strong economy, and that is what we're delivering. We have delivered lower taxes for small and medium Australian businesses. These are overwhelmingly family-owned businesses, and these are businesses turning over less than $50 million a year, which employ over half the private sector workforce. These are not big companies. These are not giant multinationals. But they're employing millions of Australians and they are employing more of them because of our reforms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member refers to energy. Let's be quite clear about this. The Labor Party's policies on energy are a repeat of policies that have failed. They want to have a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target when we know the Renewable Energy Target was a mistake. It is widely recognised as such, called out by the ACCC. What it did was displace dispatchable power and resulted in huge amounts of renewable power, regardless of what it did to the reliability of the system. And the member for Port Adelaide knows all about that because he comes from South Australia, where energy is at its most expensive and its least reliable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're committed to doing is delivering cheaper power. Prices fell in the June quarter 1.3 per cent, not a huge fall but they're coming down. And we've seen lower prices quoted by retailers for the current quarter. The new default market offer that we are going to establish, based on the recommendation from the ACCC inquiry which we initiated, will result in substantial savings for consumers and for businessesâ€”for consumers, up to $416 a year and for small businesses, $1,457 a year. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TURNBULL:</span>
                  </a>  The honourable member talked about funding for health and hospitals. We are spending record amounts in every area of healthâ€”health, hospitals, Medicare, PBS. When new life-saving drugs are recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, we list them. We don't have to do as Labor did; they postponed their listing because they couldn't afford it. A stronger economy enables you to do all that. We have increased bulk-billing rates. They're now at record levels: 86.1 per cent of all GP services are bulk-billed. Labor wants to repeat the 'Mediscare' lies that they ran at the last election and at every by-election, but the reality is that every public hospital in Australia is receiving more funding under our government than it did under Labor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of schools, again, the Labor lies are rolled out. We're spending a record $249.8 billion over the next 10 years on schools and we've cleaned up Labor's 27 'special deals' that saw students getting less funding in one state than in another. In terms of national security, Labor neglected our Australian Defence. They did not commission one new naval ship in their whole time in office. We have 53 vessels either under construction or under design, and that is because we are determined to keep Australia safe and we are able to pay for it because of the stronger economy that delivers stronger government revenues, and enables us, in addition to doing all that, to bring the budget back into balance a year early. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The alternative that Labor offers us is an abandonment of every principle and value the Labor Party used to stand for. The Labor Party used to stand for aspiration. Not anymore. It's a mystery. They used to stand for people getting ahead and having a go. Not anymore. We have the politics of envy being rolled out in every electorate around the country. Labor is going after small businesses, family owned businesses. It's going after businessesâ€”no matter how small they are, it wants them to pay more tax. It's going after individual taxpayers. It's going after retirees. I heard the Leader of the Opposition talk about self-funded retirees. Well, the Leader of the Opposition is going after their savings. Anyone with a portfolio with Australian shares in itâ€”that type of investor or self-funded retireeâ€”the Labor Party wants to take away 30 per cent of their income. It is a cash grab that will leave all of those families short. That's the Labor approach: going after families, going after self-funded retirees and going after businesses. And their energy policies can have only one result, which is higher and higher energy prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking action to defend Australian families, get taxes down, electricity prices down, jobs up and investment upâ€”the energetic economic growth that we need which results in higher wages, as we're starting to see. That's our commitment. We're standing up for Australian families, and for the Australian workers that the Leader of the Opposition abandoned in his union career and now abandons in this chamber.</span>

You know that no-one on this side has confidence in the Prime Minister, and what we also know is that half the people on the other side have no confidence in this Prime Minister. If they weren't such lions in the party room and lambsâ€”or sheepâ€”in here, they would join us in voting on this motion that this parliament has no confidence in this Prime Minister. This horror show has gone on long enough. It's bad for the country and it's bad for Australian families to have a government so divided and so unable to govern. </span>

They're sick of the cuts to health and education. They're sick of the chaos in aged care and child care. They're sick of it. And, all the while, all the Liberals can do is focus on themselves, focus on their own ambitions. Today the Prime Minister is boasting about what a great job he is doing. If he is doing such a great job, why did half his colleagues vote against him today? And, of course, he goes straight to attacking the Leader of the Opposition for his background as a union leader. I'll tell you what, I would stand beside someone who has spent his working life defending Australian working people before I would stand beside someone who has spent his life as a merchant banker!</span>

And look at the sorry lot behind him! We've got the member for Watson. Let's not forgetâ€”people haven't got that short a memory not to recall what Labor stood for when it was in power. The member for Watson wanted to take the water rights, the irrigation rights, away from my farmers and away from farmers right throughout river communities in Australia. That's what he stood for.</span>

That's rightâ€”hundreds of ships! They came, and there were 55,000 people who arrived unauthorised. He was responsible for a lot of those. There were 1,200 deaths at sea, and that was tragic. There were 800 boats. Labor put more beds in detention centres than they ever put in hospitals.</span>

It's a shame the member for Shortland and the member for Hunter don't, because they don't stand up for coal workers. I tell you whatâ€”our people do. We stand up for coal workers and we stand up for all workers. That's what we do. That's why we are lowering the company tax rate. We are getting it down to 25 per cent. What does the member for Maribyrnong want to do? He wants to push it up well beyond 30 per cent. That's what Labor stand for. They don't stand up for workers. Look at the member for Maribyrnong's recordâ€”Chiquita Mushrooms and Cleanevent. He sold those union members out.

They had to read about it in the media. Labor do not stand up for the regions. We proudly do. We are standing up for them at the moment. They are drought-stricken.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister looks at his beliefs and says: 'No, I'll throw that one away. I don't need to believe in that. Any member of the backbench can have a right of veto over anything, no matter how important I said it was.' But the alternative is somebody who has looked at the policies of both the Abbott government and the Turnbull government as we now move to the new riff of the Abbott-Turnbull-Dutton governmentâ€”that's going to be the new riff we're heading to. It's going to be somebody who sees a government that cuts penalty rates and says, 'That's not extreme enough.' It's somebody who sees funding cuts to schools and says, 'That's not extreme enough.' They see funding cuts to hospitals and say, 'They just haven't cut far enough.' They've seen government cuts to the pension on the books here ever since the 2014 budget and say, 'They're just not going hard enough.' They see an NBN that they make slower, that comes later, that's more expensive, and they say, 'They just won't have wrecked it enough.' The man says of giving $17 billion to the banks, 'They just haven't gone far enough.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a choice between a man who abandons his principles and one whose views are so extreme that he boycotted the national apology. That's what they debated this morning. That's the choice that is driving this government in halfâ€”a choice between somebody who stands for nothing and somebody who stands for all the worst possible principles. All they know, when it comes to it, is not what they believe; all they know is who they hate. At the press conference to justify why the Liberal Party fell apart this morning, when the member for Dickson went and gave that media conference he started reiterating his CV, telling us all the wonderful things that he'd done. Then he got to the reason why he just had to challenge. The reason he gave was the Leader of the Opposition. They will blame the Labor Party for everything, including this morning's leadership challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people don't care that you hate Labor, but the Australian people do care that you hold them in contempt. The government show that they hold the Australian people in contempt when people are paying for the division of the government every day. They pay for the division in this government when they pay for the increased costs in health care. They pay for the division in this government when they pay for their increasing energy bills. They pay for the division in this government when they pay for the fact that everything goes up except their wages, and then the government comes here and votes against protecting their penalty rates. This government, under this Prime Minister, lets the Australian people down all the time. Now they've added that they don't just hate the Labor Party; they hate each other too. That's no way to govern this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms JULIE BISHOP</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:54</span>):  The Turnbull government is delivering for the people of Australia through lower taxes, lower prices and more jobs. We are fighting for the people of Australia, because we have an economic plan to grow our economy and ensure there are more jobs and more job opportunities. We are the party that backs the small businesses, the mums and dads who take a risk, who start a business, who grow a business and who export their goods and services around the world. These are the people who the coalition government back to drive our economic growth and create jobs for the Australian people. That's why the Turnbull government is backing small business and medium-sized business through tax cuts. That's why we are fighting for lower costs. That's why we have our energy planâ€”to bring down the cost of electricity so that our businesses can compete around the world. That's why we have a plan to fix the GSTâ€”so that there's a level playing field across Australia for all businesses who are operating in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have turned the corner on Labor's debt. We will return the budget to surplus a year early in 2019-20. Do you know the last time a Labor government delivered a budget surplus? The last time Labor delivered a budget surplus the Berlin Wall was still standing, Ronald Reagan was still in the White House, Maggie Thatcher was still in Downing Street and Bob Hawke was in the Lodge. Twenty-five years ago was the last time that Labor delivered a surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've fixed the economic mess that we inherited. Remember that after Labor came into government, in the six years of Labor, they blew a $20 billion surplus and never delivered one. They blew billions and billions of dollars in savings. We went from zero net government debt to massive debt. In the six years of the coalition government, we've turned the corner on Labor's debt and we're getting back into surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Did these things have an effect on our economy? Yes, they did. For a start, because of Labor's economic mismanagement, they cut defence spending to the lowest level since 1938. Not one new naval vessel was commissioned for our Navy. Not only did that put at risk thousands and thousands of jobs in the defence industry's supply chain; it put our national security at risk. Then we inherited the mess of the NBN off Labor. In their entire six years they only connected 50,000 households. We are connecting 50,000 every two weeks. Every two weeks we achieve more than Labor did in their entire six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What else did Labor do through their mismanagement of the economy? They stopped listing life-saving drugs on the PBS. They stopped listing drugs. Because we have now fixed the budget, because we have now paid off the Labor debt, we are now able to list life-saving drugs on the PBS. At last count, there were 1,800 new drugs listed on the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, members, the greatest policy failure in a generation on Labor's partâ€”and, believe me, there's a big list, so I don't say this lightlyâ€”was losing control of our borders and inspiring the people-smuggling trade. There were 800 boats, 50,000 people and thousands of children in detention centres across Australia and in our region and 1,200 deaths at sea that we know of under Labor. That's why, through our Operation Sovereign Borders, we restored integrity to our sovereignty and to our borders and we put the people smugglers out of business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the policies of the Turnbull government, we now have the fastest-growing economy in all of the G7. We're growing faster than all the G7 countries. We're growing faster than New Zealand. We're growing faster than South Korea. We have created an environment that has seen 300,000 new jobs created in the last 12 months. That's 1,000 new jobs a day under this government. Unemployment is now 5.3 per cent. That's lower than, say, Canada. It's still too high, but that's why we're working night and day to ensure we can get that unemployment rate down. It's the lowest in six years, but it's going lower. Where does Labor get its inspiration from? It's Venezuela, with higher taxes, higher inflation and lower jobs growth. The coalition stands for the workers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:00</span>):  There were sighs of relief when the member for Wentworth became the Prime Minister of Australia, but, for the last three years, there have been groans of disappointment as the Australian people have expressed the view which 35 of his colleagues expressed todayâ€”that this man is simply not up to the task. This is a Prime Minister without principle and without power. He has betrayed every principle he's ever had and yesterday he gave away his power. He said, 'Any Liberal Party or National Party MP who crosses the floor will mean that the government can't implement policy.' He vacated policy leadership to the climate change deniers and the extreme right wing of his party. And how did they thank him? With a midnight knock at the door. This is a Prime Minister who has lost the confidence of his colleagues and who long ago lost the confidence of the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have pointed out that this Prime Minister does not have the confidence of the House. It's a statement of fact. We have no confidence in him and 35 of his colleagues have no confidence in him. The National Party didn't get a vote, but we know they don't have confidence in him. There's an even better reason to carry this motion: the carrying of a motion of no confidence will oblige this Prime Minister to hop in a car, go down to the Governor-General and advise an election. Let the Australian people cast their judgement on this man and on this government to make way for a government with unity of purpose and unity of agenda. That's why this motion should be carried. The Australian people deserve to have their say and to have their judgement on this Prime Minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should remember, as his colleagues remembered today, what this Prime Minister's case for election was. He said to his colleagues that they'd lost 30 Newspolls and that he could provide better economic leadership. I pointed out on the Alan Jones program this week that he has lost 37 Newspolls, but I was corrected by Mr Jonesâ€”it's 38. Then we have the new economic leadership that he promised. This is a Prime Minister who has a one-point economic plan: giving away $80 billion in corporate tax cuts. That one-point plan will die an unlamented death in the other place later this afternoon, and, when that plan dies, this prime ministership should die with it. When that plan is defeated, this prime ministership should be defeated with it, because this Prime Minister had one idea: give $80 billion to big business and let it trickle down. He had one idea. That was his answer to low-wages growth: to cut wages through letting penalty rates be cut and to cut taxes for big business in the hope and the forlorn prayer that it be allowed to trickle down to the workers of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a man without an agenda other than that one-point plan. This is a man who has, as energy prices have risen, in fairness, had many plans. He had the National Energy Guarantee, the clean energy target and the emissions intensity schemeâ€”none of which have survived contact with the enemy. By 'the enemy', I mean those sitting behind him. None of those plans have withstood the scrutiny of the House. They have not even been brought in for a vote, because they have not withstood the scrutiny of his colleagues. This is a man who's big idea was to increase the GST and then allow income taxes. This is a man who has not had the courage of his convictions to follow through with his economic beliefs and put them to the test. The member for Warringah put it well last night as he left the parliament. He said, 'The question now is: what are the principles of the Prime Minister? What are the convictions of this Prime Minister? What does this man stand for?' What an epitaph for this Prime Minister that his predecessor should ask the question: what does he stand for? The answer, of course, is very, very little other than his own survival. Well, his colleagues worked it out today. Thirty-five of his colleagues expressed a view today. They now have the opportunity to vote accordingly. The House now has an opportunity to say what his colleagues said to him today: 'You have stayed too long for any good you have done. The time has come for you to depart.'</span>

                  <a href="E3L" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  They are very cocky, aren't they? They are very, very cocky. It was the Leader of the Opposition who said, 'Just leave the keys to the Lodge there in the door.' That's what he said. As they would have heard those words from the Leader of the Opposition, I reckon a chill would have gone through Australians, for two very important reasons: Australians do not trust a potential Shorten government to run a stronger economy or to keep Australians safe. They know that they will not be safe under a Shorten-led government. They know that their jobs, their wages, the fiscal strength of this government, the AAA credit rating and the future they hope for will not be safe under a Shorten government. But they can trust the Turnbull government. They can trust the Liberal and National parties because our plan for a stronger economy is working and our plan for a safer Australia is working. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan is ensuring that unemployment is going down and jobs are going up. We have had 95,500 young people get a job in the last fiscal year, the best result in 30 years, and that deserves a strong cheer. That's what that deserves. We get no cheers from that side because there are jobs being created in this economy under the plan of this government. Debt has turned a corner. The deficit is falling and will return to balance next year. The AAA credit rating has been ensured and kept under this government. And, as for thuggish unions and big companies who want to take people for a ride, we've put in the powers and are putting in the powers to stop them in their tracks, while this Leader of the Opposition cheers them all on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, our plan for keeping Australians safe is working. It is this government, a Liberal National government, that is legislating to protect Australians from foreign interference. It is this government and these parties that have put in place the funding to restore our national security agencies, our police officers and our border protection. The ABCC has been put in there to put a real cop on the beat; union thugs were off the leash under a Shorten led government, but they are certainly not under this government. Our Defence Force is being rebuilt after the waste and the neglect of the Labor Party, who let them run down to the lowest level since pre-war times, and they should be ashamed of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is also this government that has been protecting not only our values but our borders. We ended the absolute chaos and wreckage that came particularly from the shadow Treasurer, the worst immigration minister in this country's history. He made the biggest contribution to 800 boats, 50,000 people and more than 6,000 children in detention. Every single one of them, including those who were otherwise supported by the Greens, should hang their heads in shame for the human carnage and wreckage they were responsible for and the lives they destroyed by their neglect. We've been talking about a big stick to take to energy companies. This mob couldn't find a big stick with a flashlight and two pairs of hands. Under them, there will be no stick, the unions will be off the leash and the big companies will be off the leash. They will run away under the weakness of this opposition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But more important than that, and more important than the strong policies we have, are the strong beliefs that underpin those policies: the fair go for those who have a go and who put in the hard yards. That's what our tax cuts have been about for personal income tax, for small business, for farmersâ€”for all of them. We are ensuring that we reject the disgraceful politics of envy championed by this Leader of the Labor Party. We don't think that for you to do better someone has to do worse. All Australians will recoil from the punishing taxes of this potential Shorten government. Five billion dollars a year of a slug on retirees, on pensioners, on those who have worked hard, small businessesâ€”that's what this fella has ensured for them if he is elected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an immigration policy that brings people to this country who want to make a contribution, not take one. We have a policy to ensure that the best form of welfare is a job. We don't think tax is a privilege; we think it is a burden, which should be eased on all of the Australian people who work hard. And, when it comes to our sovereign interests, this side of the House always believes we will decide.</span>

What were those two words? 'Prime' and 'minister'. Not one of the speakers has defended Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership. The speeches today are typical of what has characterised this government or, should I say, this opposition-in-exile, because what they have done is turned the coalition into the 'no-alition'. They seek to define themselves by what they're against, not by what they're for. And that is why they have nothing less than a crisis of identity, a crisis of belief between the views of the current Prime Minister and the views of the past and future prime ministers. That is why they have such a problem, because you can't define yourselves by just what you're against. We know that, when they stand up and talk about the reason why they should stay on the Treasury bench, they speak about a tax on trade unions, a tax on public education, a tax on public health and a tax on the public broadcaster. They speak about a tax against the Leader of the Opposition and all of our team. They don't present a vision for how they will actually take the country forward. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's there in their policies and we should have seen it. The current Prime Minister took over as communications minister and he actually does get the interweb thingy. As his predecessor said, he invented it! But what's he done? Twenty-one million metres of copper wireâ€”in the 21st century. That is what he has done. It's so last century! When it comes to climate changeâ€”he gets that tooâ€”he put forward the emissions intensity scheme, but can't follow it through. Then he gets the Chief Scientist to come up with a policy, so the Chief Scientist comes up with one: the Clean Energy Target. We said, 'We'll have a look at that. That looks okay.' Then it disappeared. Then we had various versions of the National Energy Guarantee, and he walked away from that as well. He says he supports infrastructure and public transport. He loves taking selfies on trains and trams. We don't want selfies; people want trains and trams funded with dollarsâ€”the Melbourne Metro and the Cross River Rail. No, that's not good enough. He'll go to Melbourne, he'll go to Brisbane and he'll go to the opening of Redcliffe rail; he just won't fund rail lines in inner Brisbane.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this motion should be carried because we know that a majority supports this motion: 69 on this side and 35 on that side. That's before we get to the Nats; that's before we get to Barnaby's mob. They're not part of that. See, you're up to 104. You're in triple figuresâ€”</span>

                  </a>  before you get to the crossbenchers or before you get to the National Party. The fact is that, under this Leader of the Opposition, we have been working to have a plan for government. We have put forward economic policy. We've put forward really difficult tax changes under this shadow Treasurer. We've put forward policies to give fairness in the workplace. We've put forward environmental policies. We understand that Australians want nothing more and nothing less than for their kids to have more opportunity in life than they had, and they want them to inherit an environment that's better than the one that we enjoy. But, instead of that true aspirationâ€”which isn't for another yacht; the aspiration of Australians is for their family, for their community and for their countryâ€”we've got the selfish attitude of those opposite. Then the Treasurer, at the moment, had the gumption to speak about the 'big stick'. I and the next speaker get to talk every Friday morning, early, and last week I said that the problem was that they were using the big stick on themselves! Well, I was wrongâ€”because now they're using it on each other! And we saw it this morning.</span>

                  </a>  is a political fraud. He is a political fraud. He just gave a speech dripping with hypocrisy, dripping with bitternessâ€”a venomous, vicious, vituperative speech from a man who nobody on his side of the House trusts. The Leader of the Opposition has left a trail of destruction behind him throughout his political career. This is a man his colleagues do not trust. This is a man who needs the CFMEU to break up meetings of the ALP in Victoria, to protect himself from his own members. This Leader of the Opposition is prepared to bring union thugs into every single forum of the Labor Party in Victoria, to control preselections, to control policy outcomes, to give them $2Â½ million worth of donations. And why? Because this Leader of the Opposition always puts himself first, ahead of every single other person.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has a list of victims as long as your arm, not just within the former Labor Party Caucus and not just people like Bob Sercombe, the former member for Maribyrnong, who was cut down by the Leader of the Opposition in his own electorate. Take Gavan O'Connor, the former member for Corio; he got in the way; he had to be dispatched by the Leader of the Opposition so that his friends could get seats. But worst of all was when they tried to take out Simon Crean, one of the doyens of the Labor Party in Victoria, a former Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition's faction had to take him out because he got in the way of this man's quest for power.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This man's quest for power was so low that he was prepared to take the penalty rates away from the lowest paid workers of Australia, from cleaners at Cleanevent. This was the man who thought: 'The cleaners of Australia are vulnerable, and I can get some benefit out of them. I can get an advantage out of them.' Do you know what the advantage was, Mr Speaker? Lists, so he could increase his power in the ALP; cash, so he could buy more memberships within the ALP; and preselection power in the Victorian ALP. And the poor old workers at Cleanevent were the ones who had to suffer. They were the ones that had to go without their penalty rates. And this is a man who comes in and gives speeches about penalty rates.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that wasn't enough, of course. The workers at Chiquita Mushrooms got exactly the same treatment. The workers at Chiquita Mushrooms were dispatchable as well, along with the cleaners from Cleanevent.</span>

And it was written about in Paul Kelly's book. Paul Kelly wrote: 'The distrust between Rudd and Shorten was intense and enduring. The Gillard camp was contemptuous of Shorten, considering him weak and duplicitous.' That's one thing she got right. 'Neither side trusted him, and neither side revised its view.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I think that at the beginning of this sitting fortnight, most observers of national politics thought that the matter of extreme and grave public importance they expected this parliament to deal with was the deep energy crisis that has emerged under this government. Instead, what we've seen from the other side is an obsession with personal ambition, petty hatreds and the weird, conspiracy-based hobby horses that dominate the ideology of this coalition's party room. For those that remember the events of late 2009, at first blush, as Yogi Berra would say, there's a lot of deja vu all over again this week. The member for Wentworth is again being stalked over climate change policy. We have the same characters playing the same roles: the member for Warringah obviously; the redoubtable member for Menzies; Senator Abetz, who we see on television quite regularly. We have the same ballot result: 48 to 35, with all that that entails for predictions about the next couple of weeks. And we see the same antiscience claptrap and conspiracy theories being spouted on TV, through the newspapers and on blogs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are some important differences between the events of 2009 and the slow-motion car crash we are seeing unfold on the other side of politics. The first is the background condition of our energy system. In 2009, it's fair to say, our energy system was in rude health. It was in rude health. Gas prices were low. Gas was plentiful. Wholesale power was plentiful. Wholesale power prices were low as well. There were no supply concerns. There were no wholesale power price spikes of the type we've seen under this Prime Minister. We also saw at least some bipartisanship around the Renewable Energy Target, so there was still a floor under investor certainty, even given the wars within the coalition party room on climate change.</span>

Australia is deep in the throes of the most severe energy crisis in living memory, which has emerged under this Prime Minister. Confidence in our energy system is plummeting. Power prices and gas prices are skyrocketing and continuing to go up in spite of all protestations from the Prime Minister and the energy minister that households and businesses have never had it better and that power prices are coming down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second difference, which has not escaped the attention of anyone who watches this, is that back in 2009 the member for Wentworth stood firm on a point of principle. He stood firm on a point of principle. That is perhaps the most significant thing the Australian people remember about the member for Wentworth. He was willing to lose his job because he said he was not willing to lead a party not committed to effective action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen over the past two years? A starker contrast is not possible. What we've seen, particularly over the past two weeks, is a humiliating series of weak, abject surrenders to the hard Right of the coalition party room, which continues to exercise a veto over sensible climate and energy policy in this country. The Prime Minister announced seven days ago an energy policy that would not see a single renewable energy project built in a decade, would halve the rate of solar installation on people's roofs and would channel billions of taxpayer funds into coal-fired power plants that the industry says are uninvestable and are inconsistent with the viability of Snowy Hydro, but that still wasn't enough for the member for Warringah. He still forced the Prime Minister to back down on that pathetic, weak policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the member for Warringah was very grateful for the backdown. As he said last night, he was extraordinarily grateful for the backdown. He questioned whether this Prime Minister has any convictionsâ€”a question being spoken about in front bars and cricket clubs and across dining tables across the country. He accused the Prime Minister simply of having a 'conversion of convenience'. What did that conversion of convenience involve? I don't think anyone really knows. We've had the third, fourth and fifth of this Prime Minister's energy policies announced in just seven days. No-one knows what the fifth policy is. The chair of the backbench energy committee confessed on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> that he had no idea what the fifth energy policy was. Apparently it didn't even get presented to the joint party room today. It certainly wasn't subject to any endorsement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reoccurring nightmare in Australian politicsâ€”of climate and energy policy being held hostage by the member for Warringah and his co-conspiracy theoristsâ€”is actually not about the member for Warringah, the member for Wentworth, the minister or the new entrant, the member for Dickson. It actually reflects much more than personality. As the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech, there is a deep, irreconcilable fissure that runs right through the soul of the Liberal Party today. It runs right through the soul of this party on a range of important policy areasâ€”policies important to the Australian peopleâ€”and there is no clearer fissure in that party than that over climate and energy policy. This is a party incapable of recognising the challenges and the opportunities involved in tackling climate change. These challenges and opportunities have only become clearer over the decade since 2009. This is a party incapable of coming to grips with the profound transition that is happening in energy systems not just here in Australia but across the globe, because they are obsessed with some leftist conspiracy involving the spread of renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's energy crisisâ€”this deep energy crisis, the likes of which people haven't seen for decades in this countryâ€”presents a range of challenges. Labor is focused on all of them. We announced we would accept the ACCC recommendation to put in place a default price on Sunday. We were very happy to see the energy minister follow our lead only 24 hours later. But, without doubt, the most important challenge in this energy crisis is investor certainty. As the parent of this energy crisis, and as the authors of the experiment of privatising this essential service over the last 20 years, no-one has a greater responsibility to deliver investor certainty than the Liberal Party. And yesterday, this minister and this Prime Minister walked away from that. They utterly walked away from that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is a deep need to replace ageing generators in our system, but there are no rules for investment after the end of this year. Be clear: this will crash investment in the sector. Businesses across the board, including those on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> today, have made it clear that, immediately, $3 billion to $5 billion of investment in new energy systems will basically be crashed by the weakness of this Prime Minister yesterday. That will have implications for jobs. This is a party that has already crashed one in three renewable energy jobs, according to the ABS, through its term. It will have implications for reliability and, most clearly, it will have the clearest of implications for prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might remember that last week they were talking a fair bit about $550. What happened to that? Well, $400 of that is from all of the new investment that they killed yesterday, and the other $150 was from the reduction in the risk premium from investor certainty. Kiss that goodbye. If you ever believed that in their second attempt to promise and deliver $550, not having delivered it six years ago, they were going to deliver it this time, that has gone. In its place, all we get is a grab bag of vapid headlinesâ€”cooked together over the last 24 hours, trying to look like they're being tough on big energy companies, wielding, as the member for Grayndler said, the big stick but mostly hitting themselves in the head on the wayâ€”and a surrender to the new coal ideologues, mainly up there but also on the backbench. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a surrender to those new coal ideologues pretending that taxpayers can fund a technology the industry itself has said is uninvestable. The academy of engineers has said it would be a mistake. The Prime Minister likes to refer to engineering a lot. The Snowy Hydro and 'Battery of the Nation' projects have said they are completely incompatible with the investments that those boards have decided upon and we thought were supported by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Households are under enormous pressure with this energy crisis. Businesses are threatened with their viability and thousands of jobs where they provide employment. There have been five attempts in two years by this government to put in place a policy that would help resolve the energy crisis they have presided over, and all have fallen victim to the parlour games of this coalition party room. This minister has tried his guts out. He has worked as hard as any minister. He cannot deliver his backbench, because he has a Prime Minister in charge of this government who has completely lost authority.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="FKL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FRYDENBERG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  The Labor Party's arrogant. The Labor Party is showing hubris. What we saw in question time today was them trying to do a victory lap before the next election! They tried that once before. That was after the 2016 election. You had the member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition, doing a victory lap. He was like Harold Abrahams in <span style="font-style:italic;">Chariots of Fire</span>, running around saying, 'I've won, I've won, I've won!' Well, two years later, he's still in opposition! And after the next election he'll still be in opposition! The reason for that is when Labor was last in office it wrecked the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you remember the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd chaos, Mr Speaker? Do you remember when it came to energy policy? The member for Port Adelaide is a nice bloke who won't give up the presidency of the Labor Party. He said in his own book that the Labor Party sent mixed signals when it came to climate and energy policy, that the Labor Party made mistakes. That's an understatement. Do you know what happened? Do you know what happened when the Labor Party was last in office? Energy prices went up each and every year. They doubled. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see some of my colleagues in the House, like the member for Fairfax, and I know the member for Bonner, and the member for Brisbane, and the member for Ryan, and the member for Fisher and the member for Forde. Do you know what they all have in common? Their seats are all in that part of Queensland where prices went up under the Labor Party every year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are the member for Rankin and the member for Lilley? They're hiding, because they know that, when Labor was last in office, in 2008, prices went up eight per cent. In 2009, prices went up 15 per cent. In 2010, prices went up 13 per cent. In 2011, prices went up six per cent. In 2012, prices went up 13 per cent. And, in July 2013, prices went up 19 per cent. That's why I say to the member for Fairfax: what about the families and businesses in your electorate? When Labor was last in office, prices went up each and every year. They ignored the warnings about the increase in gas exports and what it would mean for domestic prices. They oversaw the energy system when there was the gold-plating of the networks, which we are now trying to unwind. They had no plans for storage. That was the Labor Party's record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's not mention cash for clunkers, the citizens' assembly, the carbon tax, the CPRS, the ETSâ€”do you remember all of that? Do you remember that great Athenian example of democracy, the citizens' assembly? Do you remember Green Loans and the terrible pink batts scheme? That's what the Australian people remember. They remember the cheques to dead peopleâ€”yes. They remember GroceryWatch and FuelWatch. They remember all of that. When it comes to energy policy, they remember their bills going up each and every year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House have tried to fix the energy mess that was left to us. So we abolished the ability for the networks to game the system through the limited merits review process. If the Labor Party had thought about that when they were in office, the Australian public would have saved over $6 billion. We've ensured more gas is now available to Australians before it's exported overseas, and the ACCC has reported prices coming down by up to 50 per cent as a result of that. We've ensured that retailers have given better deals to Australian familiesâ€”1.8 million Australian families, including many listening to today's proceedings, know that they got a better deal as a result of Prime Minister Turnbull calling in the retailers and demanding a better deal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to Snowy 2.0, the member for Eden-Monaro is at the barricades, saying, 'Good on you, Prime Minister!' This is what the member for Eden-Monaro said about the Prime Minister's signature policy: 'It's an exciting project for our country.' I say to him: join the coalition, because you're supporting our policies when you don't have any other ideas opposite. But he's not the only one opposite who supports our policies. What about the member for Paterson? The member for Paterson, the daughter of a coalminer, goes out there and says that we need new coal-fired power stations. That's what she told <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think the Manager of Opposition Business and the opposition whips have a bad sense of humour. Do you know why? Because they've sat the member for Paterson next to the former head of the ACTU, the member for Batman. It's like putting Punch next to Judy. You couldn't get two bigger opposites. The member for Paterson wants a new coal-fired power station, and the member for Batman wants to nationalise the whole energy system. She'd be better off sitting with the Greens. What a bad sense of humour!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the measures that we introduced, power prices came down in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia on 1 July. Let me tell the members for Fairfax, Ryan, Brisbane, Fisher, Bonner, Forde, Rankin and Lilley what happened to those families and businesses in south-east Queensland from 1 July. They saw prices for residential customers go down by up to 5.4 per cent. They saw prices for small businesses go down by up to 8.5 per cent. That's on the watch of the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We announced another set of significant energy policies just yesterday, implementing the ACCC's report into the affordability of the electricity system. It was a coalition government that commissioned that report. It took 15 months to put together. They were able to compel nearly 50,000 documents that otherwise would not have seen the light of day. Among a number of recommendations in there that were implemented was a default offerâ€”a default offer which will now see 1.2 million Australians go off the highest standing offers to this cheaper default offer. If you're a family, you can save up to $416. If you're a small business and you're currently on the expensive standing offers and you go to a default offer, then, as a result of this, you could save up to $1,457. That's good news. That's good news for families and businesses around this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're giving the ACCC new powers to be the permanent cop on the beatâ€”to have a big stickâ€”whereas those opposite are the friends of the big energy companies. We are taking them to task. We are holding them to account. We are on the side of the consumers. You are on the side of the big energy companies. And these new powers include fines, and go up to a use of a divestment power. That is a big stick.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about recommendation 4? We will support, through debt financing, new generation assets, to deal with a mark of failure identified by the ACCC, where new generators in the marketâ€”not the big three; new generatorsâ€”who don't have definite market power can build new assets to deal with commercial industrial customers. And this dispatchable power is firm power. This could be coal; this could be gas; this could be hydro. This is firm power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So these are the policies that we're announcing. These are the policies we have introduced. These are the policies that are now working to lower power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, at the end of the day, what does the Labor Party want? The Labor Party wants to give out more subsidies. The Labor Party wants to put a tax on consumers. The Labor Party has recklessly high targets that have been opposed by its own union movement. Tony Maher, the national president of the CFMEU, in an open letter, said, 'An increased renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030 will increase the cost of electricity for manufacturing and ordinary households.' Ben Davis, the Victorian secretary of the AWU, said: 'The rush away from coal and gas-fired electricity power stations to renewables is a little unseemly in its haste, because we are potentially crucifying hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers.' This is what the unions are telling the Labor Party about its own policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No doubt the unions are not on the same page as LEAN, the environment network that supports the Labor Party, that the member for Watson says has its fingerprints over every piece of environment policy. You know why? Because LEAN thinks that higher prices are not a sign of market failure but of the market working well! That's the Labor Party's equation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're on the side of energy consumers. We're on the side of families. We're on the side of businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll leave the final word to Graham Richardson, a doyen of the Labor Party, who said of Labor's energy policy: 'They're playing roulette with people's lives, hurting pensioners and the poor more.' The unions and former Labor ministers have belled the cat on Labor's policy. You'll always pay more for your energy under Labor than you would under the coalition.</span>

                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I'll give this to the member for Kooyong: he's a trier. He keeps following up. He keeps trying. He's a stayer. Unfortunately, he's also the Groucho Marx of energy ministers, where he's saying, 'This is my energy policy. If you don't like this one, I've got another one! I've got another one ready to go.' He's had five energy policies in two yearsâ€”five in two years! He's had three in seven days, since Tuesday of last week, when he had his triumph in the party room. We've had NEG Draft 1. Then, on Saturday, we had NEG Draft 2. Then, by Sunday night, we had this other thing that they can't describe and they refuse to give us the legislation for. But just imagine that! He's the minister who's had three policies on energy in seven days. I note his perseverance, but I've got to give him points down for his policy coherence, because it's appalling. It's abject surrender after abject surrender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How would you be if you were the current Prime Minister, the member for Wentworth, looking up at the ceiling at 4 am on Monday morning? This is a man who had a legacy in 2009, saying, 'I will not lead a party that's not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.' Then, at 4 am on Monday morning, when the demons of the soul are confronting him, he's looking up at the ceiling saying: 'I will surrender to the member for Warringah. I will surrender. I will enact his policy and completely walk away from any commitment to emissions reduction.' Just think of it! It's rare to see someone's soul ripped out before your eyes, but that's what we saw on Monday in this place with the Prime Minister. It's rare to see it, but unfortunately that's what we saw: a man who destroyed his legacyâ€”his one remaining legacy of being committed to taking action on climate changeâ€”just to hold onto power for, at the moment, somewhere between three days and two weeks, depending on whether the member for Dickson moves on Thursday or whether he moves in September. Just think about junking your legacy to sit as Prime Minister for two more weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a tragedy, but it'd be a minor tragedy if it didn't impact anyone else. Unfortunately it affects every single person in this nation. It affects every single person in this nation because their abject surrender of energy policy, their abject surrender on any commitment to rational policymaking, is hurting working families. It is hurting pensioners every day. We've seen 5,000 megawatts of power being withdrawn. We've seen 5,000 megawatts of power stations close down in the last six years because they're getting old. They're at the end of their natural life, and they're closing down. But we're seeing very little replacement because of the energy policy uncertainty in this place, because they have had no energy policy for the five years they've been in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the result of this? What happens after that? We've seen wholesale electricity prices double under their watch. In the last two years alone, we've seen a 30 per cent increase in retail power prices. They talk about the last quarter, but they don't mention the two years before that, where we saw a 30 per cent increase in retail power prices. That affects families and pensioners right nowâ€”right now, they're feeling it. I have the honour to represent the town of Windale, which is the poorest town in all of New South Wales. Those are people who struggle every day to put food on the tables for their kids, and they're facing 30 per cent higher power prices because the fossils in the Liberal Party room can't accept a decent policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're now at a ridiculous stage where not only have they surrendered but they won't even give us draft legislation on whatever their policies of the day are. They refused. Yesterday in question time the Prime Minister admitted that every single backbencher over thereâ€”the member for Canning, for exampleâ€”has a right of veto over government policy. Until they get it through their party room with 100 per cent support, we're not allowed to see draft legislation. What an appalling state of affairs we have right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reflects on this government. Energy policy is really the symbol for this government's dysfunction. Five years of infighting. Five years of surrendering any policy principle that gets in the way of holding onto power, just to stop Labor. This is all just to stop Labor, who's got a committed plan to reduce power prices and reduce emissions. This MPI is very important because it symbolises this government's moral bankruptcy. This is a government that will do anything to stay in power, but won't stand up and reduce power prices.</span>

                  <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  The irony of this debate is almost too much to bear. What an extraordinary claim by the Labor Party and those opposite, who know all too well that the price of power today is the result of their disastrous legacy. They'll shout and they'll argue otherwise. We've heard it all before. But those on the other side knowâ€”don't they, Minister for the Environment and Energy?â€”that they are responsible for this mess. But it's okay, because we're fixing up the mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party wants to talk about power pricesâ€”they talk big about power pricesâ€”but let's have a look at what happened when they set about dismantling the energy market. We've heard it all before today, but I think it's worth repeating: (1) last time Labor were in office, electricity prices doubled; (2) prices went up every year they were in office; and (3) they introduced the carbon tax and when we repealed itâ€”that's right, we repealed itâ€”Australians received the largest reduction in power prices on record. That's pretty good. But the Turnbull government has overseen a drop in retail power prices across three states on 1 July and that is good news for all people across those states. Wholesale prices are down 25 per cent compared to this time last yearâ€”more good news. And no matter how the Labor Party wants to spin this, we on this side know we are going to deliver and are already delivering lower electricity prices for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party just simply cannot be trusted to manage the national energy market. Let's look at some real examples. No point them bleating about what we're doing, let's look at what the Labor parties have been doing around the country. Let's look at the gold star winner, South Australiaâ€”a Labor government which gave Australia its first state-wide blackout. What a legacy, what an absolute bunch of champions! There were 1.7 million people with no lights on, and half a billion dollars of taxpayer money was what the Labor government cost South Australians. And we know that a Shorten government would take that failed experiment to a national scale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition already has told us he wants a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target because he thinks it was such a great outcome in South Australia. And he'll push ahead with this policy, even though we all know it's a recipe for higher pricesâ€”we've seen this time and time again. Even in my own home state of Western Australia, the state Labor Party also wanted to take a 50 per cent target to the election last year but they dropped it, like a bag of hot potatoes, thankfully, because their own members rebelled. Well there is some sense after all in WA state Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Collie-Preston, Mick Murray, a frontbencher who represents a coalmining community, threatened to resign if his party were to introduce such a policy. He knew that such a policy would be a disaster. He knew it would destroy jobs. He knew it would drive power bills up and he knew it would punish regional communities. The Labor Party, especially in Western Australia, are having a great crack at destroying regional communities. At least they didn't have it at 50 per cent, so that's good news, and the opposition leader knows that too. We know his energy policy is not edited by the Labor Party; it's edited by the Greens party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leader wants an emissions intensity scheme but he's too afraid to have the modelling done. But that's not a problem, because the Climate Change Authority has done the modelling all for him. What that modelling told us was that power bills would increase, on average, by $192 per year for 10 years. There is no way a Labor government will ever bring down the price of electricity. But this government, us sitting on this side, are committed to bringing them down and we've already demonstrated that. We'll set a default price next year and we'll put a process in place to enforce compliance. If those energy companies fail to pass savings to Australians, they'll be penalised. And to use the phrase coined by the Treasurer, 'we've got that big stick'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our energy policy will create a more reliable system and introduce a new requirement for more dispatchable power to lower prices and also to avoid those blackouts. We know that if those opposite ever were to grace these couches that they would drive up the price of electricity and they would rob Australians of baseload power to secure preferences for the Greens. We, on this side, are determined to get the price of power down for the mums and dadsâ€”my mum, her relations on the East Coastâ€”and we're also determined to support business. And it's only the coalition that can be trusted.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HRI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  What we've seen is that the only consistent power policy on that side of the chamber is the power politics policy. The number of times they've engaged in coups now has completely preoccupied them. It has paralysed them, preventing them from producing the power policy this country needs. For five years they've sat back, fat, dumb and happy, spinning on their axis, while power prices have spun out of control around this nation. What is the reason for that? Obviously the major factor has been the lack of stability in policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The country is crying out for a bipartisan approach to energy. We know that so many experts have said that is the key to getting investment in power generation. We know that renewable energy can deliver that baseload power, which all the experts say will bring down power prices. But the government has crippled that investment flow. And no less a person than their own Chief Scientist has said that industry needs policy stability to give it the confidence to invest in new power plants. So firstly, the uncertainty of policy has helped drive up those prices. That is completely on the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, of course, is the gold-plating of the network. The network companies based their investment decisions on forecasts projecting demand for electricityâ€”that it would continue to riseâ€”and those forecasts were wrong. In New South Wales they spent billions, and that cost was passed on to consumers. That was a major factor in price rises at the time of the effect of our Clean Energy Future package. It had very little to do with that, and what was there was offset by our compensation scheme for all those people that needed it. Here today, when we're talking about the impact of higher electricity prices, this very government is the one that's trying to take away the energy supplement and the relief that people need for their situation. As my colleague says, we've seen a price rise of 30 per cent in two years. The gold-plating of the network was a big factor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closing of power stations has been another factor. That's been a product of the privatisation of the system. We've seen Northern and Hazelwood go. The decision to close Hazelwood power station was made in boardrooms in France and Japan because Victoria allowed privatisation of its network. That's the only reason that happened. There were another 10 minor power stations that closed in this five-year period, on this government's watch, with no action being taken to ensure that that base-load flow of investment was coming in behind that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we've seen, with this underinvestment in the maintenance of those plants, that the uncertainty and the breakdowns that happen with individual generators also add to impact on cost. The government talks about trying to prop up Liddell. In the last big heatwave that we had, it was Liddell that was the problem. Two of its four units fell over. It was the Snowy Hydro scheme, the biggest of our renewable energy projects, that kept New South Wales going during that time. It's the uncertainty in the existing coal infrastructure that's also putting pressure on prices, particularly because of issues relating to propping up the system during peak hoursâ€”the spot market and the hedge market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas, of course, is another big issue. As those coal-fired power stations fell over, people fell back on gas generation. The government wouldn't listen to us when we told it to enter into a national guarantee on gas. We said this would happen. We begged the government over years to do that, and it did nothing until it was too late. Additional to that are the effects of privatisation themselves. The government allowed that process to go with no strategic approach to regulating the market, so those private companies have been out there gaming the system and absolutely ripping consumers off. We've seen something like a 13 per cent profit margin from those retailers, which is more than double the norm for utilities. That's happened on the government's watch. There was no plan to regulate the market as it was unfolding in that respect. It was complete negligence in the management of our system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that renewables will bring those prices down. That's what all the experts say. In fact the ACT is on target to reach 100 per cent renewable energy, and it has the lowest bills in the country. All the analysis has found that renewable energy targets will help soften price rises by increasing competition in the national energy marketâ€”I thought you guys were in favour of competition! I also point out that we've talked a lot about Snowy 2.0. The government are threatening it because of its plans to build coal-fired power stations. It says that that long-term commitment of 60 per cent renewable energy by 2040, that it highlights, will reduce energy spot prices in New South Wales by 10.2 per cent. It's the culmination of Snowy 2.0 and renewables that will deliver lower prices. The government needs to listen to the community out there and get its act together. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  This is about a competition between two different policies. If you look at the scoreboard today, on one side you have the Labor Partyâ€”six years, and the price of electricity doubled. Speaking as somebody from South-East Queensland, electricity prices went up every single year under Labor. If you look at the other side of the scoreboard, you have the Turnbull government. We have seen in South-East Queensland, from 1 July this year, reductions in prices of up to five per cent for residences and eight per cent for businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has not only been a disgrace at the federal level. At the state level, we still have a Labor Party in Queensland. This is a Labor Party that has been more than happy to see poles and wires on charge to consumers at ridiculous, inflated prices. We have ownership from the Queensland government. They've been more than happy to see the values of those assets maintained at a high level. The answer is to actually write down those assets. If the Labor Party in Queensland cared about the pensioner at home and if the Labor Party in Queensland cared about the small business owner, they would write down those assets. It would not cost them a cent. And, if the Labor Party in Queensland were to say,' We will not privatise,' then they have no reason not to write down the assets. There is a reason they won't write down those assets. Do you know what that is? They love the money. They love the dividends. They know the higher their assets are valued in Queensland the more they can charge those pensioners, the more they can charge those small business owners and the more they can charge those hard-working Australians struggling to put food on the table. They are more than happy to apply what is effectively a secret tax to price gouge every Queenslander, and do you know what they'll do? They'll put it in the coffers of an incompetent state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also a state government that has been more than happy to ensure, on ministerial instruction, no less, that the government owned entities take out debt. They take out debt and then they pay it back to the state government in special dividends. This is a racket; this is a scam. They're more than happy to have government enterprises taking out debt, and I'm talking about nearly a billion dollars of debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we done on the other side of the equation? What has the coalition government already done?</span>

                  </a>  Good question. What have we done? Do you know what we did? No. 1: we scrapped the carbon tax. That's what we did as No. 1. We reduced the RET. We reined in the networks. We put more gas into the domestic system. How about Snowy 2.0? The list just keeps going on. Do you know why we're doing that? Unlike those opposite, we actually care about the pensioner, we actually care about the small businesses and we care about the hard-working people who can't afford to put food on the table because they've been price gouged by state monopolies up there in Queensland. It is the federal government taking action. And, by the way, that's just action to date. That is why the scoreboard is looking good. But what we have now is a plan to just keep on going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a plan to ensure that we have more dispatchables coming into the system. We're going to have base load. How good is this? That's why they're silent, because not only did they have a poor track record; they didn't have a plan. The only plan you hear from those opposite is a 50 per cent renewable target. Woo hoo! Drive prices up. Are you serious? This is what we have. The party on the other side wants to jack up not just taxes but also electricity prices. Not only are we ensuring that we'll have dispatchables coming in but we will also ensure that there is a new default mechanism for price. Effectively, it's almost like a recommended retail price, if you like, with serious issues for anyone who breaks that. We're going to have a cop on the beat with the ACCC that they have not seen before, with serious teeth, including the possibility of having to divest those assets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  We have a clear choice when it comes to energy policy. Labor is for renewable energy and lower power bills. The Prime Minister is for more coal and higher power bills. North-west Tasmania has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, but, thanks to the Prime Minister's complete capitulation to the hard-right agenda on renewables, billions of dollars of investment and thousands of potential jobs in renewable energy in Tasmania are now threatened. Tasmanians know their Battery of the Nation vision isn't the Liberal Party's. It is an idea that has a long history in Tasmania, with strong support from many industry players, including former Hydro-Electric Commission chairman Peter Rae. It was not invented by the Prime Minister, as he said last week. It is an idea that only stacks up alongside a broader transition to renewable energy. Labor understands this transition. We need to ensure a clean, modern energy system. Labor understands the huge potential this transition brings to Tasmania in terms of jobs, clean and affordable energy and lower pollution. It is a transition that a divided and anti-renewables coalition cannot and will not deliver. Instead, it means no Battery of the Nation and higher bills for all Tasmanians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's backflip on the Battery of the Nation only further demonstrates that any credible development of evidence based policy and taking serious action on climate change and power prices is in tatters. Tasmanians want certainty in where investment will be attracted to build renewable energy to be used across the countryâ€”and the north-west of Tasmania, with some of the best renewable energy in the world, is attracting interest. As I said before, more than $2 billion in planned investment is now under threat by those opposite. And we can thank, in part, Senator Eric Abetz, who continues to push forward not the interests of Tasmanians but the interests of the troglodytes in the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There could be certainty in lower power prices, which can only be driven by Labor's commitment to 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030; certainty in reduced pollution; and certainty in jobs. Hydro Tasmania has said that the Battery of the Nation initiative supports Australia to embrace cost-effective renewable energy generation while maintaining secure, reliable energy supply. But expanding the pumped hydro arrangements in Tasmania through that initiative only makes sense if you have a government in Canberra that will deliver renewable energy investment, not seek to strangle it as this government has and will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's definition of clean energy is coal fired power. This government's definition of what Australian taxpayers want for their money is new coal-fired power stationsâ€”which take the better part of a decade to build, are not as flexible as a modern energy system requires and are exposed to high levels of carbon risk. And guess what? They also produce expensive electricity. Even this government's own Treasurer has admitted that new coal power stations are not the answer to higher power bills, saying 'new cheap coal is a bit of a myth'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this government is not focused on lower energy prices or reducing pollution; it's just about appeasing the Prime Minister's enemies in the Liberal Party so he can keep his job. But even that strategy has come undone at the seams. This government's energy plan will smash jobs and investment in renewables. It will achieve no significant cuts in pollution from the sector that is responsible for a third of the total carbon pollution in our economy and it will push power prices up even further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The experts have been very clear that the best way to lower power prices is to support new, cheap, reliable and clean electricity generation investment, and the cheapest new generation today and into the future is renewables backed up by appropriate storage. This is exactly what Labor will deliver. We will not walk away from our commitment to 50 per cent renewables by 2030 and our 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 on 2005 levels. We will declare my region, the north-west coast of Tasmania, as Australia's first renewable energy zone, sending a signal to investors to invest, generate and create renewable energy jobs in Braddon. My electorate can deliver some of the cheapest wind power anywhere in the world, with the potential to be a great export earner, selling electricity to places like Victoria and receiving income back to be used for support services and to do other great things in my state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Abetz yesterday destroyed the Tasmanian government's position on the National Energy Guarantee. The Prime Minister and Senator Abetz have abandoned Tasmania's renewable energy industry. It is now abundantly clear that the Prime Minister cannot provide the leadership needed to solve his energy crisis.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  The energy crisis that we have in Australia at the moment is quite simply a gigantic failure of the states. The states have responsibility for providing energy to their people in each of their respective jurisdictions. At the moment in Queensland, they actually own the poles and wires. The poles and wires have been acknowledged as creating about 50 per cent of the increases in families' bills. They actually own the Queensland poles and wires, and this gold-plating is just going on. It's an incredible system. The Queensland government have actually been caught out for gaming the system and creating further profits than anyone else would be game to announce, yet this has been run by the government against the people of their own state. In Victoria, where I live, they are sitting on 50 years of gas reserves, and yet the Andrews government has a moratorium and a ban on the extraction and even the exploration of gas. They've got the opportunity to bring the explorers in, find out where the gas seams are, bring more gas onto the market and create lower electricity prices, but they choose not to. They choose not to have any gas exploration. Certainly they have no gas extraction from onshore gas wells in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they want to do is build a gas port off one of the docks in Melbourne, so they're happy for someone else in Australia to have gas wells, they just don't want to do it in their state. In Victoria, they don't care whether it comes from the Northern Territory, whether the gas is drilled in Western Australia, whether it's taken out of Queensland or whether it's even from South Australia. They're happy to bring it around on boats, they just don't want to have any in their own patch, because, somehow or other, it's okay for someone else to do that work, but they don't want to get their hands dirty themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria, they also tripled the coal royalties that they were charging at the Hazelwood mine. Within three months of that decision, the French owners decided to close Hazelwood down. This has also had a huge impact on the price of electricity in Victoria. There are some of the most amazing anti-electricity price policies that are coming out of the Victorian Labor government, and yet all of a sudden we look around the various states and see the cost of energy to the average Australian household. Well, the Australian government felt as though it had to get involved. It had to try and generate a NEG, a National Energy Guarantee, that would somehow or other create further investment into the sector, not just in investment for renewables. We all love renewables and we all want renewables to be the cornerstone of our electricity grid, but we also want to look after the families and the businesses that need electricity when the sun is not shining and when the wind is not blowing. The previous member said her plan is that she wants more and more renewables backed up by appropriate storage, but she failed to mention what this appropriate storage could be for the whole world.</span>

It will when we get Snowy Hydro 2.0 up and built, but the concept that pumped hydro or natural hydro can effectively be the battery for everybody, at the moment, doesn't work. At the moment we need base load and dispatchable electricity for when our families need it and when our industry needs it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that some of the plans around here are for just more and more renewables. It's going to make that other mix of the system, which is critical and which is the dispatchable power, even more expensive. There is no way of dodging this. The more you load up the system with renewables for when everything is going wellâ€”when the sun is shining and the wind is blowingâ€”the more expensive it's going to be to rely on dispatchable power, whether it's gas-generated or coal-generated, to deliver the power and electricity when it's needed. This is an inescapable fact that the opposition are happy to gloss over because they want to keep sheeting home the fact that renewables are the answer to everything. We're hoping one day renewables will be, but at the moment, they're not. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms TEMPLEMAN:</span>
                  </a>  I know, it was a mistake. When he was rejected by his colleagues yet again to drop his energy policy, I just thought, 'Oh, he's weak. He's a bit bemused. He's sort of sad.' But now it is an inescapable truth: he has no principles and he has no beliefs. It's not that he's ditched them. They obviously weren't there to begin with. What we're talking about today is power, and that's exactly what is going on, on the other side of the chamber. This is about power. It's a Prime Minister whose only belief was the belief in powerâ€”power for himselfâ€”throughout his political career. Clearly, there were never principles involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we turn to the Minister for the Environment and Energy. This is a man who changes energy policy so fast that you don't really know which one they're up to. Is it the emissions intensity scheme? It is the Renewable Energy Target? Is it NEG 1? Is it NEG 2? Is there a NEG 3? You have to wonder what his legacy is going to be as energy minister. Let's think about it. As environment minister, this is a man who has effectively cut the highly protected areas of Commonwealth marine parks in half. He has halved them. This is the largest area in the world limited to recreational fishing that is now being re-accessed by commercial operators. Perhaps the most disturbing thing of all is that the government has now established a massive trawling area immediately alongside the Great Barrier Reef. Longlining will now be permitted north to south through the Coral Sea. That's a decision made by this minister that is bad for the reef and bad for recreational fishers. We are going to restore the damage that that minister has wrought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's think about him as heritage minister, because that's another portfolio he has. This is the heritage minister who has failed to act to save the colonial gem Thompson Square in Windsor. Right now, under cover of night tonight, they are preparing to dig up convict-built brick barrel drains that are 200 years old. They're unique; you can't find them anywhere in the country. All this is so the New South Wales government can slap a bridge through the placeâ€”one that won't even solve our traffic needs. This is a minister who just sat back and let this happen. It's the oldest public square in the country, and he will be responsible for its demise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So is it any wonder that all we have is confusion, indecision and inaction? What is the consequence of all of this? Clearly we have policy paralysis, but that isn't the worst of the consequences. The worst of it is that everyone who opens their mail and pulls out their power bill tonight is going to see skyrocketing power prices. That's the real consequence. It's a consequence of the chaos that's occurring on that side of the chamber. There's no point shaking your head, member for Wide Bay, because the Nationals have had their fair share of chaos as well. People are desperate for relief from power bills. Perhaps that is impossible for the Prime Minister and some of those opposite to understand. Perhaps they've never struggled to pay their power bills. But every one of us understands that our constituents are struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a confession by the other side that there is a crisis, and that gives me perhaps some idea that there is some tiny little understanding of it over there. In March last year, the Prime Minister said, 'We are facing an energy crisis in Australia.' So there is recognition there, or at least lip service to recognition. A year agoâ€”this is one of my favourite quotes from the Prime Minister, actually; it really sums up where we're atâ€”he said, 'That's why I say our policy is based on engineering and economics, not on ideology and politics.' What a joke that is! The crisis has emerged under this government. People weren't talking about power prices in 2010, nor in 2013. As old power stations have gone offline, as they've reached the end of their life, this government has had no framework in place to allow investment to occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk to farmers, small businesses, manufacturers, pensioners, single parents and familiesâ€”they are all struggling. Yet the only plan we have from this government is a plan to talk about themselves. That's all they're doing. We know that, even when something is put in place, this government will put in something that is inadequate. It will not deal with power prices and it will not deal with the issue of climate change. That will be the legacy that this government leaves us.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  This matter of public importance today focuses on 'The Government's chaos and division on energy policy which is forcing Australians to pay higher power prices'. But they're not paying higher power prices, actually; power prices are receding. Let me give you the numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, we have provided an example to the rest of the Australia of what happens if you allow policy to not be properly controlled and the transition on energy to not be properly controlled. The rampant policy, the RET, got out of control, and it was harvested by the former South Australian government to a point where we have 52 per cent renewable energy in South Australia. That in itself would be a good thing if we weren't at risk of the lights going out and didn't have the most expensive electricity in the nation. But it is coming down. In fact, South Australia's wholesale price for electricity in 2017 was $108 a megawatt hour. This is the average price. In 2018 it was $98, and so far this year it's $89. So it is coming down. Those prices are starting to come through into the retail yields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a publican the other day tell me that his latest offer is $15,000 a quarter less than the one he was on before. As a result, he can put somebody new back on the payroll. He said, 'This is good progress, but we need more.' And we know we need more, which is why this government is dedicated to making sure those prices keep going in that direction. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been focused on the NEG, but it's not the only firecracker in the cupboard. In fact, the work the Prime Minister and the energy minister had done prior to now is very important in what's been happening with electricity prices in Australia. The legislation that was passed on having the ability to curtail gas exports until the major companies put more gas on the Australian market, effectively almost halving the price of spot price gas, has been absolutely integral in this recession of prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of people may not understand, but the price that the whole electricity column receives is the last price bid into the system. In so many casesâ€”in fact, almost 40 per cent of cases nowâ€”the last price bid into the system is gas. The effective halving of gas prices has brought down the time that open cycle gas-fired peaking stations come onboard, the figure at which they kick into gear. This has put the pressure down on the whole electrical column. It also comes after the Prime Minister brought the electrical retailers into the office and gave them a good talking toâ€”about being clear, direct and transparent with their customers. This has enabled thousands of customers Australia wide to change companies and chase down a better deal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other things on offer. The Labor Party is pursuing a 50 per cent renewable target. We have 50 per cent renewable in South Australia and we have the dearest electricity in the nation. That is a problem. I think the push of the NEG, and that's what we're trying to do at the moment, is to turn a lot of that renewable energy into base-load energy. If we legislate the NEG, the hot market in South Australia will be investment in storage, and that is exactly what we need to do. If you just pursue renewable energy and do not take into account how this changes the total format, the total complexity of the way energy is delivered, you willâ€”not you personally, Mr Deputy Speaker, but whoever that proponent isâ€”fall on hard times. What happened in South Australia will happen to you. You blow up the system. You lead to a point where you cannot supply. And even now, while the prices have backed off, we are still the highest in Australia, and it would be much worse if we did not have an interconnector to Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALP is aiming for 50 per cent renewables but the Greens are going for 90 per cent. The Labor Party are chasing a 45 per cent cut in CO2 emissions when our commitment in Paris is 26 per cent. </span>

Today we are celebrating 75 years since Dame Enid was elected to the parliament, the first time a woman was represented in the House of Representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the 1943 election, which was won by the John Curtin led Labor Party, Enid narrowly won the seat of Darwin in Tasmania for the United Australia Party. At the same election, Dorothy Tangney was elected as a Labor Party senator representing Western Australia. She was the first female senator. Enid Lyons was a woman who overcame adversities in her life, including sickness and tragedy. But she was a strong and resilient woman and she became a role model for many women right across the nation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enid and Joe Lyons were Australia's first political couple. Their children were the first children to live in the Lodge. In fact, the Lyons children were famous across the nation, with Joe and Enid inviting the press into the privacy of their home to take pictures of what was then a very new thing in newspapers. It is a very great privilege to be joined in the House of Representatives by many members of the Lyons family today, particularly three of her grandchildren and two of her great-grandchildren. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enid and Joe campaigned together. Enid made speeches and radio broadcasts for her husband and alongside her husband. They thought of themselves as a team. But, when Joe Lyons died in office in April 1939, Enid's greatest contribution to public life was still to come. Enid was left a widow of 11 children. Her husband's death was a tremendous loss, and yet she made the decision to enter parliament in her own right. In her maiden speech, the anniversary of which occurs next month, Enid was humble but fully aware of the historic moment:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It would be strange indeed were I not tonight deeply conscious of the fact, if not a little awed by the knowledge, that on my shoulders rests a great weight of responsibility; because this is the first occasion upon which a woman has addressed this House. For that reason, it is an occasion which, every woman in the Commonwealth, marks in some degree a turning point in history. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The speech was beautifully written, with smatterings of homely wisdom but also far-thinking policy ideas on population and decentralisation, an encapsulation of her political philosophy. She said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the problems of government were not â€¦ problems of statistics, but problems of human values and human hearts and human feelings. â€¦ I hope that I shall never forget that everything that takes place in this chamber goes out somewhere to strike a human heart, to influence the life of some fellow being, and I believe this, too, with all my heart: that the duty of every government, whether in this country or any other, is to see that no man, because of the condition of his life, shall ever need lose his vision of the city of God.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earle Page nicknamed Enid 'the woman who wouldn't be sat down'. Others referred to her as 'the lady member'. She was both literally and figuratively a lady, and the sole female member of the House of Representatives. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Enid became the first woman to serve in federal cabinet but famously, and regrettably, without a portfolio. I thought I would reference one paragraph from Anne Henderson's biography of Dame Enid Lyons that particularly stood out for me in this great book: 'Dame Enid had her advantages. Her title gave her seniority in the social and political pecking order of the day. Hers was a household name across the nation. She had her fans and not merely in her electorate. She was continually followed by the press and asked to do broadcasts, speak at functions and lend her name to charity campaigns.' Then Anne Henderson writes: 'Had she been a man, there's no telling where her career might have taken her'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Enid suffered from various illnesses and ailments during her life and ultimately it was her ill health that forced her early retirement at just 53. We owe her and Dorothy Tangney and their election to the parliament a very significant debt. It was a very significant moment in our history and we honour their memory appropriately in the House today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  The 1943 election was a great oneâ€”a landslide win for the Curtin Labor government and the first women elected to the Senate and the House of Representatives. We mark today the 75th anniversary of those first two women in the Commonwealth parliament. Dame Enid Lyons of the United Australia Party, the forerunner of today's Liberal Party, and Dorothy Tangney of the Australian Labor Party were both elected on this day in 1943. Welcome to Enid Lyons' family, who have joined us today in the chamber. I also want to acknowledge Dorothy Tangney's family, who are celebrating her historic Labor election win, and we'll celebrate that in more detail later this year. Both of these women were originally teachers but from different parties and from different backgrounds. Both of them made an enormous impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enid Lyons ran for parliament for the first time in 1925 in the seat of Denison, losing by just 60 votes. She supported her husband's, Joe Lyons, move to Canberra, campaigning vigorously all over the country, even when she was pregnant. On becoming Prime Minister in January 1932, Joe Lyons' first act was to write to her, 'Whatever honours or distinctions come are ours, not mine.' Enid became an integral part of his leadership team. Following her husband's death, Enid successfully ran for the Tasmanian seat of Darwin, now Braddon. This self-confessed rabble-rouser was a great orator at a time in politics where this mattered a great deal. Robert Menzies once said that she could move him to tears over the condition of a railway track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After being re-elected twice, she became the first woman to hold a federal cabinet position when she became the Vice President of the Executive Council in 1949. Enid Lyons was widely credited with the Menzies government's decision to extend child endowment beyond firstborn children. She advocated raising allowances paid to returned servicewomen to equal those of returned servicemen and was outspoken against the debarring of married women from employment in the Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same election that saw Enid Lyons elected to the House of Representatives, Dorothy Tangney became the first woman elected to the Australian Senate. Dorothy Tangney, one of nine children, grew up in Perth in very difficult financial circumstances after her father was severely injured at work. Her political sensibilities were formed by witnessing the deprivations of her own family and so many others during the Depression. She joined the Australian Labor Party at 17 and quickly became an active and involved member. Like Enid Lyons, she unsuccessfully ran for state parliament in 1936 and 1939 and also for the Senate in 1940 before winning a spot in the Labor landslide of 1943.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate, she had some views in common with Enid Lyons, supporting recommendations for increased child endowment and pensions for deserted wives and civilian and war widows. She was a passionate supporter of education and a strong proponent of free university education as well as of national health care, successfully seeking to introduce pensions and hospital and medical benefits for tuberculosis patients and the blind. In her first speech, she emphasised the importance of a woman's place in parliament as equal partners in Australian society saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I also realize my great honour in being the first woman to be elected to the Senate. But it is not as a woman that I have been elected to this chamber. It is as a citizen of the Commonwealth â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout her career, she campaigned for equal pay and equality in matters relating to divorce and child custody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We pay tribute to these trailblazing women today and we try to imagine just how strange and lonely it would have been at times to be the only two women in this place. How different this place would look to Dorothy Tangney and Enid Lyons todayâ€”I imagine particularly for Dorothy Tangney, who was for 25 years the only woman in the Labor caucus. How pleased she would be to see that about half of our members today are women. How pleased both of these women would be to see women in leadership positions across major parties and to have seen a female prime minister. None of this could have been achieved without these pioneers, and we honour their achievement and their work today.</span>

                    </a>  by leaveâ€”I rise to speak on the tabling of <span style="font-style:italic;">Human rights scrutiny report: r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport 8 of 2018</span>. Of the new bills examined in this report, seven have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit or do not engage human rights. The committee has also requested further information in relation to the human rights compatibility of two bills and concluded its examination of a number of other pieces of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to highlight one of the bills with respect to which the committee is seeking additional information: the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. As set out in the report, the bill promotes multiple human rights, including the right to freedom from slavery and forced labour, by requiring certain entities to prepare annual statements on actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. The report notes that, while Australia has a number of measures in place to prohibit slavery and related practices, the measures introduced by the bill address a gap in Australia's capacity to identify, investigate and respond to instances of modern slavery. These proposed reporting requirements are therefore to be welcomed from a human rights perspective in order to complete its technical assessment against Australia's international human rights law obligations. The committee has also requested some further information as to the compatibility of an aspect of the measures of the right to privacy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude by noting that, last week, I was pleased to launch a database containing the committee's reports, developed by the Australasian Legal Information Institute, AustLII, with the support of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law. While the committee's reports are available on its website, it is very welcome that these reports are now accessible in searchable form as part of AustLII's broad range of online legal materials. I trust that this database will be a valuable resource for all those interested in the committee's work. I thank AustLII for including the committee's reports in their collection. I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's latest scrutiny report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation. With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Report 8 of 2018</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many are dismayed by the failure of the Australian parliament to reach a settlement on energy policy. I'm glad the member for Port Adelaide is with us to hear this contribution. Over a period stretching more than a decade, political partisanship has run interference on every attempt to put a carbon constraint in place without unnecessarily pushing power prices up or undermining electricity reliability. It's a both bewildering and sorry story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's an even more bewildering story to tell. Next year marks 10 years since the completion of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into government drought support. The PC's work should be compulsory reading for anyone with an interest in farm and drought policy. Like in the energy sector, we still have no coherent and effective drought policy 10 years on. What makes this even more incredible than the energy story is that we managed to lose 10 years, despite the lack of partisanshipâ€”at least until the member for New England came along.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 Commonwealth and state primary industry ministers reached an historic agreement on drought reform. They agreed that drought support based on exceptional circumstances was 'no longer appropriate in the face of a variable climate'. Sitting at the COAG committee known as the Standing Council on Primary Industries, which the now government abolished in 2013, ministers further agreed to commission the PC inquiry and report. Another historic agreement followed. On 3 May 2013, SCoPI ministers, including the former Queensland agriculture minister and now federal Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government, signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform. It is worth noting that five of the nine ministers who signed that agreement represented conservative governments. It is important to note that both the 2008 and 2013 agreements enjoyed not only bipartisan support across the political parties; they also were backed by the key farm leadership groups. So why is it, 10 years on, we are now dealing with the third government drought announcement in two months? Why is it that the last two announcements came only a fortnight apart? Why is it we still have no coherent drought policy based on the 2008 and 2013 agreements?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer can be found in the September 2013 election result. Two things followed. First, the member for New England became the Minister for Agriculture. Second, the now Turnbull government abolished the SCoPI, the key COAG committee. Remember, underpinning the Commonwealth-state agreements was the recognition that the changing and more challenging climatic conditions demanded a new and different approach to drought. As the new minister then, the member for New England had a different view. He doesn't believe our climate is changing and nor does he think we should be taking any responsibility for or action on it. His 2015 failed agriculture white paper made only a passing reference to it. So I suppose we should not have expected him to embrace a policy approach based on that proposition. Minister Joyce made his view well knownâ€”'Climate change is a conspiracy, but the best way to deal with it is to build dams.' I always said he'd never build a dam and he never did. His response, no doubt, will be to say he ran out of time. Well, he had five years. How many years did he need? Was it 10, 20 or maybe 25 years? I don't know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">SCoPI was the key driver of that drought policy reform. As a COAG committee, it was properly resourced and structured. It held regular meetings, was supported by key public servants and had a diverse agenda, including drought, biosecurity and productivity. Members of the government will argue it was replaced by a thing called AGMIN. This is a fiction. AGMIN is no SCoPI. Indeed, the department of agriculture website says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agriculture Ministers' Forum (AGMIN), which is chaired by the Australian Government Minister for Agriculture, agreed to meet face-to-face once a year and for ad hoc meetings as required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is what AGMIN has doneâ€”met once a year. The member for New England, when he was minister, often didn't even turn up. I suspect he viewed it as a bit of a waste of time. SCoPI was the vehicle for drought reform, and its abolition cost the nation five years of drought reform progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the 2009 PC report, and prior to the signing of the 2013 intergovernmental agreement, SCoPI agreed to trial new drought measures. The exercise was held in the agriculture region of Western Australia. The measures aimed to achieve the following outcomes: to ensure farmers and their families were better equipped to adjust to the impacts of drought, increased climate variability and reduced water availability; to develop a more effective social support system for farming families and communities; to encourage farmers to adopt a self-reliant approach to managing farm risks; and to encourage farmers to use Australia's natural resource base and water resources more sustainably and efficiently. The pilot consisted of seven programs: Farm Planning; Building Farm Businesses; Farm Family Support; Farm Social Support: Rural Support Initiative, Online Counselling for Rural Young Australians Initiative and Rural and Regional Family Support Service; Stronger Rural Communities; Farm Exit Support; and Beyond Farming. This was an extensive agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the results of the trials were mixed, ministers agreed to soldier on with the reforms. The 2013 IGA set similar objectives:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">b. encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage their business risks</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">c. ensure that farm families in hardship have access to a household support payment that recognises the special circumstances of farmers</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">d. ensure that appropriate social support services are accessible to farm families</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">e. provide a framework for jurisdictions' responses to needs during periods of drought.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That last, of course, was a reference to the roles of the states, as opposed to the Commonwealthâ€”something still not well delineated. Ministers further declared that the agreement should facilitate the achievement of two key outcomes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">a. primary producers have an improved capacity to manage business risksâ€”</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and business risks, of course, include drought; and:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">b. farm families are supported in times of hardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past five years, little progress on these objectives and outcomes has been achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commonwealth and state ministers also agreed that the 2013 farm household allowance should be a temporary payment only. This decision was consistent with the view that drought cannot be treated any longer as an abnormal event; rather, protracted dry events and higher temperatures can be expected to be regular events. There is no justification for providing ongoing income support to farmers who are not viable during protracted dry spells. I've heard no-one challenge that proposition. Farm household allowance was designed to provide farmers with the support and the time they needed to adjust or to adapt, or, indeed, to leave their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest iteration of farm income supportâ€”that is, the farm household allowanceâ€”is time-limited and comes with mutual obligations. Farmers can opt in and opt out of the farm household allowance. And they could receive the payment for no longer than three years in totalâ€”until, of course, the Turnbull government increased it from three to four years, from June this year, just prior to the winter break. Labor supported that because there was a complete and utter absence of any longer drought reform policy. So the government left us with no choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mutual obligation requires recipients of farm household allowance to enter into a financial improvement agreement. An FIA requires recipients to accept case management and to enter into activities like further study or training, or even paid work elsewhere, to contribute to self-sufficiency. As stated already, the Turnbull government has extended farm household allowance for an additional year but there's little evidence the mutual obligation side of the government's FHA design has been a success. Both outcomes reflect poorly on the government's performance on drought and drought reform policy. Every time the government concedes the need to extend income support or spend more money on farm welfare, it is also conceding failure, including a failure to meet the agreed objectives of the 2013 intergovernmental agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were aspects of the PC's report that surprised many of the policymakers. For example, it alerted us all to the fact that in 2005-06 the largest 30 per cent of farms generated 82 per cent of the total value of agriculture operations, while the smallest 50 per cent of farms generated just seven per cent. As a group, the bottom 25 per cent of broadacre farms have not made a profit in any year from 1988-89 to 2007-08. In 2007-08, 23 per cent of Australia's farms received drought assistance, totalling over $1 billion, with some on income support continuously from 2002. Obviously, these figures are dated, but I've seen nothing to suggest that any of those trends have changed much. These revelations were, or should have been, a wake-up call to all policymakers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PC also pointed out that the most vulnerable farmers are not necessarily those facing the toughest drought conditions; rather, the most vulnerable to drought are those which are already marginalâ€”my words, not the PC's. The most vulnerable farms are those which lack scale, suffer the effects of land degradation and have not embraced regenerative practices, have low liquidity and capital, lack diversity in their income sources, have a broken business model or have a poor take-up on the innovation front. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that brings me to the counterproductive nature of past approaches to drought policy. The drought policies of the past created a moral hazard, sending a signal to those who don't adapt and prepare that the taxpayer will always be there in their time of need. This, of course, undermines the incentive for others to build resilience. In building resilience and self-reliance a farm business relies on five levels of capital: natural capitalâ€”the soil and water resources on which it relies; physical capitalâ€”the infrastructure and technology that farm businesses use in production; financialâ€”the income both on farm and off farm; the capitalâ€”both debt and equity; humanâ€”the labour, skills, education and experience of those who work within the farm business; and socialâ€”the ties between people, both on the farm and with the local community. These are the areas which should have been our policy focus over the course of the last five years. Sadly, that hasn't been the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the length and severity of the current drought, the Turnbull government has been asleep at the wheel. It only started to focus when the media started to bring drought to the top of the public discussion. Four years ago, the opposition was telling the then minister and indeed the government that farmers were finding it all too difficult to access farm household allowance. Minister Joyce's flippant dismissal of our concern led to an unfortunate answer to a question from me in this place and subsequently the doctoring of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and, sadly, the dismissal of the secretary of his department by the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I noted, after five years of policy inaction the Turnbull government has now made three drought announcements within two months. This bill seeks to give effect to one of them. Firstly, it gives effect to an increase in the assets test for farm household allowance from $2.6 million to $5 million. They are, of course, on-farm assets. Secondly, it gives effect to the introduction of the supplementary payment of up to $12,000. These changes are being made despite consistent claims by government ministers that the farm household allowance required no adjustment. They were still saying that up to a month agoâ€”even more recently, I think. Now its changes are almost daily. Only last night I was informed by the government that it'd be amending this very bill we're debating tonight. The ink is hardly dry on the bill, and already the government is amending it. All of this is happening as the government continues to progress a review of the farm household allowanceâ€”a review, we are told, that will not be complete until next year. I ask members to think about this: we need a year to work out what is needed to change a system that didn't need changing but is now being changed on a daily basis. It's chaos. There's no logic or rationale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition will support the changes contained within the bill but we are obligated, I think, to point out that there are many part-pensioners in this country doing it pretty tough, because their pension begins to taper off when their assets go through about $375,000â€”it's $5 million for farmers and $375,000 for pensioners. There are many unemployed people struggling on a Newstart payment which is frozen and not keeping pace with the cost of living who face about the same assets test as pensioners: around $375,000. That's a big difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has always supported a more generous asset and income test for our farmers. We recognise that, when things are difficult, they can be asset-rich with all those farm assets and very income-poor. We acknowledge that and have always supported it. But $5 million seems extraordinarily arbitrary. If we are not careful, we will lose community support for these income support measures. I heard one farmer complain that his assets are $8 million, so he'd still miss out on farm household support. There is something dramatically wrong with that narrative. It can't go on ad infinitum. Income support must be the bridge to something better, not just a bridge to nowhere and more of the same for those who are doing it toughest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mistake we too often make is to treat farmers as homogenous. Every farmer is different and every farm business is different. I can introduce members to farmers in the most drought-affected parts of Queensland and New South Wales who are doing quite well in the face of drought, because they've built the necessary resilience. We have old farmers, young farmers and people for whom the farm is a secondary income or the dominant of two incomes. We have growers, croppers, producers, graziers, pastoralists and apiarists. There are those who grow fish and grow trees. It's a very diverse portfolio or sector.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are publicly listed companies, privately owned corporates, cooperatives and, of course, family farms. Some have scale, some don't. Some have embraced technology, some haven't. Some take a science based approach, some not so much. Some are on good land and others are on marginal land. Because of our history with soldier settlements, there are many on marginal landâ€”governments didn't give away really good land. Some rely heavily on chemicals, some do not. Some are organic, others are not. Some export, some don't. Some want to grow in size and, believe it or not, some don't. It's true of all small businessesâ€”some are keen to grow, some don't necessarily want to grow. But they all have one thing in common. They need their government to do at least 10 things: keep the economy strong; keep interest rates low; keep costs and red tape compliance down; make sure there is a workforce with the necessary skills; maintain a strong biosecurity system; grow and maintain markets; provide the supply chain with infrastructure and connectivity; provide data and climate information; ensure we have strong research, innovation and extension systems; and address market power inequality.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many farmers need help to adapt to a harsher climate. Adaptation and resilience-building must be our key response to a hotter and drier environment. We must help farmers regenerate their landscapes to improve the quality and biodiversity of their soils and to retain more water. Raising soil carbon levels by one per cent on an acre of land will hold around 140,000 additional litres of water. I've said it before: we can improve our soils quickly and less expensively than we can build dams.</span>

As we grow towards a global population of some 10 billion, we should be asking ourselves how we are going to feed all of those people. It is clear to me that we won't be able to unless we deal with the decline in our soil and water resources. Indeed, we should be asking ourselves how we're going to feed 40 million Australians by 2050 if our natural resource base continues to decline. We owe it to future generations to change our course, to focus more on value and less on volume, to ensure our natural resources are directed to the activity that produces the best return, both for our farmers and for our broader economy. Most of all, we need to do it in a sustainable manner. We can't keep asking more and more of our natural resource base and expect not to run into problems in the future. This should be an absolute priority for government. This should be the key approach to drought managementâ€”not short-term fixes, not drought tours for the 6 o'clock news, not measures that do nothing to assist farmers to take that different course. This needs to be our focus. It was certainly the focus of COAG, and it should be our focus now. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question becomes: how do we help farmers better embrace those best-practice farming methods? I've given this much thought, and a few weeks ago I announced that a Labor government would direct our research and development corporations to play a major role in that effort. Our research and development model is a Labor architecture from the late eighties and early nineties. It's a good architecture. It's in need of some regeneration, and if we are given the opportunity we will revisit the structures and operations of those research and development corporations. They will remain co-funded by government but we will ask them to do more on this front. They are big organisations, they are well-resourced, they have the expertise and they already do extension work. They are already helping our growers and producers and our horticulturists to embrace better methods, but the work is underdone. Extension has been withdrawn, largely, from the agriculture sector. It was once largely the domain of the states. They now have largely withdrawn and the Commonwealth hasn't filled the vacuum. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there is a great opportunity for the Commonwealth to do just that and to build upon what our research and development corporations are already doing by further progressing the science, further progressing the best practice and making sure those practices are getting down onto the farms where they are most needed. Research and innovation is not very helpful if it's not getting down inside the farm gate. That's where we need it to be. I invite the government tonight to think about that proposition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should have a bipartisan approach to this matter. We should have a bipartisan approach to agriculture more generally. There is no more important sector than the one that feeds us and the one that puts the clothes on our back, and we should be doing this together. We should be doing it most energetically. Together, we should be doing all we can to assist farmers facing what is a shocking, protracted drought, close now to becoming the worst drought in the history of European settlement. While there are things we can do short termâ€”and I thank the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians who have so generously donated from their own pockets to various drought appealsâ€”we won't fix this problem, we won't properly deal with this problem, we won't properly do the right thing by the farm sector if we don't take that long-term view, if we don't embrace that long-term strategy, if we don't go back to the COAG agreement and start to rebuild collaboration with the states and properly delineate the roles of the states and the Commonwealth.

We can't wait for tomorrow. We should be starting tonight. Minister Littleproud, unlike the member for New England, has acknowledged that the climate is changing. I think he has acknowledged, too, that there is a need for mitigation. But he has certainly acknowledged that there is a need for adaptation. I think all of us in this place have an opportunity to do good things, despite those lost years, and we should be starting to do that tonight and tomorrow, because the way the weather patterns are lookingâ€”as members know, the Bureau of Meteorology is not predicting any substantial rain either in the spring or in the summerâ€”things are going to get worse, not better. It is too late, having lost five years, to enhance the capacity of many of our farmers to deal with drought. But it's not too late to start again, and we should start very, very quickly.</span>

Listening intently to the shadow minister, you would think he doesn't realise that we are already doing an awful lot of carbon sequestration programs right throughout regional Australia. We have carbon sequestration projects in my seat of Murray, right throughout the seat of Parkes, right throughout the seat of New England and up into Maranoa. We have carbon sequestration projects either being implemented at the moment, being done right now, building up the carbon within the soil, or in the planning stages of being done. We have over $2 billion on the table to increase this drought resistance capacity that the shadow minister thinks is his primary policy. He thinks he is going to actually be able to somehow or other make these farmers more resilient against these droughts. If it were that simple, we would already be doing it. In fact, we are doing that aspect of it.</span>

That money from the federal government has been on the table for a couple of years now; we simply have a Labor government in Queensland that is not interested in that type of infrastructure.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we have hundreds if not thousands of farmers throughout regional Australia who are working on their own carbon sequestration projects, planting the right pastures, working on their water irrigation patterns to gain the greatest benefit they can to grow the most amount of feed they can and taking advantage of the over $2 billion that's on the table for carbon farming. It's an amazing project that we have going now. The challenge goes out to the shadow minister for agriculture to state his case as to whether or not he's going to be there for farmers. He seems to be talking about how the fact that we have to keep going back to farm household allowance somehow means that farm household allowance is a failed program. I don't think that's the case. I don't think many governments in Australiaâ€”either the state or federal governmentsâ€”saw the milk crisis coming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People would like to think that we had the ability to forecast an oversupply on the world milk market. When those milk companies started to drop the price dramatically and then asked for this clawback, it was an enormous hit to the dairy industry here in Australia. Within a week, Barnaby Joyce was in the Goulburn Valley offering farm household allowance and lower interest rates in that 2016 period. Most of those farmers found themselves to the tune of around $50,000 better off with that assistanceâ€”up to around $30,000 on interest rate assistance on a million-dollar property and up to about $24,000 in assistance with a farm household allowance. This bill is going to increase that $24,000 up to around $37,000 with a couple of one-off payments. That's going to be very much appreciated by these families who, in these times of crises, need to put food on the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party need to be able to state very clearly if they think these types of policies are the right way to go, whether it be for a commodity that hits its value floor, which is what happened with the milk crisis of 2016, or whether it be for a drought, which we're seeing now. These measures are occasionally implemented for any disaster, whether that be fire or flood or, predominantly, drought. Occasionally it can be these various commodities that, without any blame being sheeted home to the agricultural sector, find themselves in a state of disaster. This is what happened with the milk crisis in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Littleproud, Prime Minister Turnbull and Deputy Prime Minister McCormack have been on the front foot again with a range of packages that increase the farm household allowance and the time lines that are available. In the first tranche of changes, we moved that time line out for an additional year to allow farmers who are already on the supplement to have an extension. That was something that's been very well received. We see now an increase in the threshold. Previously $2.6 million in assets was the threshold. That's now been pushed out to $5 million. I agree with the shadow minister that to many people that sounds like a lot of asset to have, but you have to understand the nature of farming. It's a very real proposition that you could be asset rich but not even have enough money to buy the groceries that a normal family would need. By taking the asset threshold out to $5 million, it's going to be very well-received in our families that are facing that hardship. We understand that those farmers who have little or no access to cash are going to need this type of assistance. It will give them the breathing room that they need to be able to adapt to change. They won't have to sell their assets, as has currently been the practice of trying to put food on the table. Often, when you have to sell assets in times of drought, you sell for way below the market price for whatever that asset be. Whether it be stock or machinery, you sell for way below the valueâ€”for much less than it's worth. Obviously, if it does happen to be stock, the problem is that you then have to go back and restock at a price that's way in excess of what you've been able to achieve in times of drought. What we're hoping is that this supplement will enable families to resist those practices, because we know how tough it is on those families when it happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also note the proposed farm household allowance supplement will be payable to all farm household allowance recipients in addition to existing payments. These two lump sum payments will be in addition to existing payments. It will be $3,000 per person for a member of a couple, if you happen to be in a couple, and $3,600 for all other circumstances for individuals. That means, if both members of a couple are receiving the farm household allowance between 1 September 2018 and 1 July 2019, they will receive $6,000 each or $12,000 extra per household. We think this is incredibly important. We are also urging farmers who find themselves in this situation to not self-assess. We understand that, especially with the low-interest facilities that are available and because of the need to take assets as surety for the loans that have been allowed, there is a lot of paperwork that needs to be done. Assetsâ€”not just on-farm assets but also off-farm assetsâ€”have to be accrued. We need to be very, very diligent because we're dealing with taxpayers' money. There is a lot of paperwork with this. Sometimes it has been seen that farmers have self-assessed and seen that they are not eligible. However, with an extra $5 million going into the Rural Financial Counselling Service, we would like to see farmers who think they might be eligible to use that counselling service so that they can get the help that they need and so that the assessment can be done without the emotion and trauma of going through a drought and also having to try and see if they are eligible to receive this additional assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government cannot make it rainâ€”we can'tâ€”but we can be there for the farmers when they need us. We don't know when the next drought is going to come. We don't know when the next commodity crisis is going to hit one of our industries. I know that many of our pork farmers right now are going through an oversupply of pork, forcing them into some very perilous financial situations. We don't know how bad that situation is going to get, but, at the moment, we know it's serious. We know that people in the pear industry are struggling to find markets where they can receive payment for their pears that is above the cost of production. These problems are going to be ongoing. It's hard to know about these issues in advance. What we need is a government that understands agriculture and that will be there for those people when they need it, in times of crisis. As the previous member, Mr Fitzgibbon, said, we rely on the agriculture sector to feed us. There's no more honourable or more important industry than the industry that feeds us, so we need to make sure that, as a government, we're there for them. Under the member for New England we were, and under the member for Maranoa we are. We understand that at the core of what the National Party believes in is supporting our farming industries, both in good times and bad. Right now, with the drought hitting a large part of Australia, it's a tough time and we need to be there for them. The amendments we've brought forward into the parliament are going to help us support our farming industry through this tough time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="262273" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEAY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I appreciate and welcome the opportunity to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 and to support the shadow minister's second reading amendment. It is a very important amendment and one that I hope those opposite will support because it will support our farmers with a lot more than what the government is currently proposing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is being proposed, though, is very long overdue and will go some way to relieving the hardship faced by farmers in our community. The current focus is on drought, and I have to make this point: the member for Mallee was concerned about our focus on how we can make our farmers much more resilient and have sustainable farming. I will just say this: we must recognise this thing called climate change. It's a thing that the farmers recognise. They are experiencing extreme weather events much more frequently than they used to. They recognise that they need to adapt. It's a shame that this government will not adapt with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to ask the question though: where was this government when the dairy crisis hit in 2016? Where was this government when Tasmania was in the grip of its worst drought in history, between 2015 and 2016? It seems that the circus that has beset this government as the Prime Minister currently clings to his job is perhaps the real reason why we now have this legislation. Or is it because the affected areas are in the backyards of current sitting government members that we finally now have some action?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even today in my electorate, the electorate of Braddon on the north-west and west coasts of Tasmaniaâ€”and, of course, King Islandâ€”I am advised that there are up to 10 farming families still receiving farm household assistance as a result of the dairy crisis and that up to 14 other farming families in other sectors are also receiving the household allowance. Many other families have now come off household assistance, which is a good thing, but I'm sure that these farmers and their families would have appreciated the bit of extra support that's in this amendment if this government had acted seriously two years ago. Labor understands the urgent need to support farmers struggling through the current drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as I have asked the question as to why this government failed to act during the Tasmanian drought and then through the diary crisis, I have to ask the question: where has this government been when it comes to drought policy? On this issue alone, there have been three policy iterations over the last eight weeks. It sounds a little similar to the government's energy policy! I think that on that score, though, it's about 10 different energy policies in the last seven days, no doubt with more to comeâ€”we would hope! Ten weeks ago, the government said all was fine with drought policy and that nothing needed to change. Eight weeks ago, the government changed tack and announced a plan to extend from three to four years the period that a farmer in financial crisis could receive farm household allowance. That announcement, in itself, did nothing to address the complexities of actually applying for and receiving farm household allowance, which I'll come to a bit later. And just two weeks ago the government announced another policy to introduce a farm household assistance supplement payment and temporarily increase the farm asset limit when assessing applications for assistance. Again, the government failed to address the bureaucratic nightmare that farmers face in trying to access farm household assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I say this, I think about the number of instances in my electorate a couple of years ago when farmers were trying to access the allowance through the dairy crisis. We've been calling for improvements to the processing of this allowance for many years, and so have farmers. The internet is riddled with media stories of farmers waiting many, many months just to get the allowance processed. I remember the times when farmers would say to me, 'We actually need to spend money to try to access this allowance.' They needed to go to their accountants and get up to three years of financial projections to then give those to the government to say,' Can you please approve my application?' And then they waited for many, many months after that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also fail to address their policy shortcomings when it comes to preparing for and managing drought. As I said in my opening remarks, Tasmania is not immune to drought. Hobart is the second-driest capital city in Australia and, even today, parts of the East Coast of Tasmania are shown by the Bureau of Meteorology as being in a 16-month rainfall deficiency. Given this historic rainfall deficiencyâ€”and not just in Tasmania but, of course, New South Wales, southern Queensland and northern Victoriaâ€”it should not take a rocket scientist to work out that the government should have a clear and articulate drought policy. But what has this government actually done? One of the first acts of the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for New England, was to dismantle the Standing Council on Primary Industries, or SCoPI, the COAG council working on longer term drought reform measures. The dismantling of this council makes no sense when you look at the current Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform. That agreement lists, at point 9:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Future programs related to the objectives of this agreement will be consistent with the principles for reform agreed by the Standing Council on Primary Industries ...</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and, at point 10:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Future programs providing temporary in-drought support will be consistent with the principles and processes agreed by SCoPI ...</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the minister please explain how this is meant to work? On the surface, a dismantled body can't guide future work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is filled with climate change deniers. You only have to spend time talking to our farmers and they will tell you climate change is very real. Does anyone on the other side of the House actually know what this government's policy is to deal with climate change and the land? On this side of the House, however, Labor has been developing strategic policy solutions to deal with drought. The shadow minister has already put these policies on the public record, but they are worth repeating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will restore the COAG process for drought reform. Labor will also ask the Council of Rural Research and Development Corporations to lead the development of an agricultural climate response plan. Labor has committed to establish a $20 million regional economic development fund to support drought-affected communities. The fund will be directed towards local councils as local government has the knowledge of what is required to stimulate local economies and support local jobs. Labor has also developed policy to greatly improve farmers' abilities to deal with the complexities of receiving Farm Household Assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This side of the House supports measures to increase Farm Household Assistance to farmers in financial crisis, but the government's latest amendments to this bill just add more complexity. I know struggling farmers in my electorate and throughout Tasmania who are currently recipients of FHA will welcome this legislation, but what the government has failed to do is, firstly, allow farmers to take up the supplement payment in a single amount, and, secondly, deal with the nightmare of trying to access the allowance. Labor strongly believes farmers should be given the option to receive their allowance supplement in a single payment. It just goes to show how out of touch the Prime Minister is. When asked about providing this payment in a lump sum, his response was: 'March is not too far away.' Tell that to a farmer who is struggling now; tell that to a farmer who would like that extra money to get themselves back on their feet and deal with the situation and challenges that they're facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from experience with the farmers in my electorate that, when a crisis hits, it is hard enough to live through each day, let alone wait weeks and months for that extra bit of support. Can someone from the other side please give a coherent explanation as to why farmers doing it tough should have to wait? March not being not too far away, as the Prime Minister said, just does not cut it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2016 federal election campaign and shortly after, farmers in my electorate were hit from multiple angles. First there was and still remains a $1 milk price war between the supermarkets. Then came the slashing of milk prices in April 2016 by Murray Goulburn and Fonterra. It was a body blow and, combined with its retrospective nature, many dairy farmers in Braddon struggled to come to terms with the clawback. Then came the June floods, which were devastating, not only for dairy farmers but also across the entire agriculture industry and our communities. Farming families' mental and physical health were being affected by the very real and difficult situation they found themselves in. I have to commend the support by the broader community in the statesâ€”it was not just in Tasmania but also across the countryâ€”who supported our farmers. Their efforts are truly extraordinary and I thank them for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At that time I invited the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture, the member for New England, to visit Tasmania: 'No strings attached; no politics; just come and see my farmers; come and see how they're hurting; talk to them.' I think he completely underestimated what that would've meant for those farmers. When he politely ignored my requestâ€”he didn't refuse it; he just ignored itâ€”I said that it was probably because the Liberal Party of Tasmania would not let a National Party member into the state. Now I've extended that invitation to the current Minister for Agriculture, and, as we have one member of the National Party in Tasmaniaâ€”and that's the only member of the National Party, Steve Martin, who has sold his soul to the governmentâ€”perhaps the new minister will come to my electorate and speak to farmers and actually see what we do in a very agriculture-rich part of the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, through the cocktail of stress at that time, the government did offer some support via concessional loans and farm household assistance. Concessional loans were, and remain, problematic for farmers. They're not only very difficult or almost impossible to obtain; they also set farmers up to fail by increasing their already-climbing debt. Many, though, took up the challenge to try and receive the allowance. That process in itself remains a nightmare, with very lengthy delays.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2016 dairy crisis, a multitude of issues arose relating to the allowance. Farmers' cash flows were at crisis point; yet, in many cases, they faced very long delays to have their applications assessed. They were in desperate need of help and having to rely on food vouchers and other assistance from the community to try and make ends meet and put food on the table. The IT program processing the claims was not fit for purpose. My office had to intervene to help farmers in Circular Head get access to this assistance. Some were waiting up to three months for any help. And, even after these families received their allowance, the problems continued. Twelve months after receiving the allowance, they were cut off, due to a so-called glitch in the system. Again, my office had to intervene. It should not come to that. There's enough stress in farming and in trying to put food on your table and pay your bills when you're facing these sorts of crises, without having the government stuff up something as simple as an IT system. But this government has form on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2016 crisis, I wrote to the former Deputy Prime Minister raising concerns about the delays farmers were dealing with. The Deputy Prime Minister respondedâ€”he acknowledged the problemâ€”but, to this day, the government has done nothing about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just this side of the House who knew accessing the allowance was an issue. Rural Business Tasmania, in their submission to the review of the Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform, made the following point: 'We believe the farm household allowance has potential to be a successful output of the IGA, but the delivery mechanism needs further review. Issues over the life of the FHA include: the telephone number, 132316, as the person phoning may wait up to an hour or longer to gain a helpline support person; the complexity of the application process, including the number of forms; delay in outcome, in some cases up to 10 weeks; and clarity of requests for further information can provide frustration.' Rural Business Tasmania succinctly summed up the issue further in their submission under the question: 'What can be improved?' Their answer? 'The farm household allowance concessional loan process.' I trust this government is now taking notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put on the parliamentary record my thanks to the teams at Rural Business Tasmania and Rural Alive &amp; Well for the work they do in supporting farming families. There is no doubt that many farming families would not have got through the trials and tribulations of the drought, the dairy crisis and the floods without their work. These organisations continue to do great work for our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to delivering the allowance to struggling farmers, Labor knows that it can and must be done better. This government has gutted Centrelink, causing the delays in accessing the allowance. But Labor will rebuild Centrelink by employing an additional 1,200 properly trained full-time staff. Labor has announced that, in my electorate, an additional 50 Department of Human Services officers will be employed to give further support. Those officers will visit regional communities so that clients, such as our farmers, can get access to the support they need. I commend Labor for doing that, and I trust that this government will follow suit. But we will sit here and wait a long time for that to happen.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I'm going to touch on the issue of climate change, because I always hear that people on our side don't believe in it and that believing in it on the other side's going to fix the problem. I want to do it from a very practical farming perspective that people might find of some interest. It isn't what you believe, it's what you do that matters in the farming sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our family has had a farm or been in the farming district for years around Bridgewater. I still own a commercial farm. Yesterday I sold 132 lambs and they made $155.80. So I know something about agriculture. I'm a Nuffield scholar. I've looked at agricultural policy in about 70 countries. I think I can speak with some authority. It disappoints me to see that the member who just spoke is going to run out the door, because they'd find this very educational. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the 124 years from 1894 to 2018 we've got the growing season rainfall figures for Bridgewater. This is very interesting. Did you know there were 18 very dry years in the first 62 of those years and 14 in the following 62 years? We tend to imagine, when we talk about climate change, what our parents can tell us and what our grandparents can tell us. My grandparents met in the war years. They began farming in 1946. They farmed through to 1976. If you could talk to my grandmotherâ€”she's now passed awayâ€”she would say, 'We live in a very good farming area. We always get the header out and we always harvest something.' There was only one year out of those 124 years that was a very dry year. They farmed through reasonably wet years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1976 the seasons dried out again. The challenge for us, if we really want to address policy settings around agriculture, is to develop a farming system that doesn't just reflect what our grandparents experiencedâ€”because, historically, they were wetter yearsâ€”we have to develop a farming system that is the long-term average over 124 years. That long-term average is dryer than what our grandparents and parents experienced. You can have the discussion around climate change or not, and I have a view that we should be responsible global citizens. We should plant trees and we should look after the environment. That is our moral obligation as citizens of the world. But we also need to realise that we have, in many ways, developed farming systems that have been based on historically high rainfalls and not over the last 124 years that have been dryer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's work through the things we need to do if we're going to develop farming systems that will give us some long-term stability. Those things will be based around, firstly, ensuring that we have the right genetic varieties and farming techniques. We have crops in the Northern Mallee that still have the potential to yield, because of no-till farming techniques, because of the research and development that has been invested in from this chamber. It was John Kerin, when he was a Labor agricultural minister, who set up the R&amp;D organisations where the government co-contributes with industry to try and drive productivity. That model, good policy, has been adopted and adapted and kept from when it was implemented in the Hawke era. So there are things that are bipartisan on this side and there are things that can really go a long way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on what the government is doing. I don't think this should be politicisedâ€”that somehow everything we're doing is terrible and everything they'd do would be betterâ€”because there's some good in it, and this policy, I think, will stand the test of time. Farm household support is really about grocery money, money for schoolkids, money for kindergarten and money for school uniforms. Essentially, what we're saying is that when a farmer is going through drought they shouldn't have to worry about how they're going to feed their family. Just like we have a safety net in our Centrelink system for people who are unemployed, in a drought situation you will have a farmer who may have a large number of assets but hasn't earned any money and we should stand by them. Just like we stand by someone who's unemployed because they haven't got any income coming in, we should stand by them. That is what the farm household support is about. It's $25,000 per couple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important amendment here is a recognition that in the past the threshold of farm assets was $2.5 million and we are now increasing it to $5 million. That's because just because you have assets in a drought situation you have been precluded. Those assets might be land assets or in water allocation and the water allocation might be zero. Or you might have 1,000 megalitres of water. At the moment, at $4,300 a megalitre, that is $4.3 million worth of assets. So this amendment is about essentially lifting that threshold to $5 million, and I think that's sensible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we've done is we've given two lump sum payments of $6,000 each. There is a lot of value in that because there's grocery money on the table but there are school fees that need to be paid. We don't think that country kids who are the children of farmers should be disadvantaged. We think they also deserve to have a decent school uniform, a new set of shoes and maybe some Christmas presents. That's really about trying to take off some of that household pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often have a view when we talk about farms. They often grab the farmer out there who's handing out a bit of fodder or trying to put a little bit of grain out to some drought-affected sheepâ€”that is, the bloke. One of the things I've seen, having been on the board of the National Farmers' Federation and having been the VFF president, is that so much of the psychological burden of drought is on the partner of that farmer. Having some support around that household at least takes some of the burden off that partner. There are amazing rural women out there who are standing behind their blokes across New South Wales and Queensland at the moment. I want to say that this parliament pays tribute to you and your assistance. I know, having farmed through the 2002 drought, the 2006 drought, the 2007 drought and the 2008 drought, the burden that my wife carried when I was out there trying to make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I want to talk about which is an important part of the package is the low-interest loans. I want us to just fully understand the advantage of these, because we somehow look at the low-interest loans and think not a lot of money has been placed down in the low-interest loans. But their purpose and really what Barnaby Joyce, the member for New England, was trying to do with those low-interest loans is to put some competitive pressure back on the banks. You've got to understand that it wasn't that long ago where a household loan was at five or six per cent but a farm loan would be at eight and nine per cent. Yet the level of equity that a bank was requiring on a farm loan was extraordinary, so there was really no risk for them. By us entering the market as a Commonwealth lender and saying, 'We will loan you money in the instance of a drought,' it forced the banking sector to close that margin drastically. Now you will see situations where a home loan has basically the same interest rate offered as a farm loan. That in itself has saved millions and millions of dollars of repayment in the farm sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about the two things that we've offeredâ€”farm household support for grocery money and for schoolkids and support of the households and being there as a banking facility to put downward pressure and competitive pressure on the banksâ€”they have actually assisted our farming sector. The other thing that we've done which is very important is essentially open up the market. In 1992, when we went through some dry times then, I remember we had old wethers that were worth nothing and we had to shoot them. My father couldn't do it. It was actually me and a friend of mine who, after school, at 17 years old, had to do it. He just couldn't get over the waste of it. But the great contrast between then and when we farmed in 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2008 was that, because we have opened up the opportunities for marketsâ€”instead of exporting to 12 countries, we now export sheepmeat to 96 countriesâ€”livestock commodities stayed high. That makes such a difference. If you're selling stock or having to unload stock and you're still getting $150 a head for it as opposed to getting nothing, that's additional income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that our drought measures have made provision for is that farmers can actually park that income from the sale of drought-affected stock and it doesn't become part of the taxable income for that year. It's part of a financial mechanism so they can bring that back into production later. Those things are very good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that I think has been instrumental in assisting us through dry times has been the significant investment in water infrastructure and in fodder retention infrastructureâ€”tax incentives for hay sheds and for grain storage silos. There is also what farmers can now do with piped water. If there is one thing that climate change is showing us very clearly it's that we're having higher rainfall intensities and then longer dry periods, and so the ability of the catchment dam to hold water doesn't appear to be there anymore. Progressively, the Victorian government, in conjunction with successive federal governmentâ€”governments of different persuasionsâ€”have rolled out piped irrigation infrastructure. I can see it taking place in my patch now. I'm still pretty keen to see some funding for the Mitiamo pipeline system, which is going to require $29 millionâ€”some from the Victorian government, some from the farmers and some from us. We haven't found that money yet. But the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline system, which was funded by the Victorian Labor government and the federal government in the Howard era, is a billion-dollar project. It's the biggest pipeline system in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would be surprised at just what you can do, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz. I put my own pipeline system on my farm. I ran three miles of two-inch polypipe with a double impeller Honda pump. You wouldn't believe it: a five-horsepower Honda pump, using a litre an hour, will deliver 100 litres a minute out the other side.</span>

                    </a>  Yesâ€”it's incredible what you can do with pipeline systems now. What we're seeing across our agricultural regions is the rejigging of stock and domestic pipelines when, in the past, catchment dams may have done that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People ask, 'Do you believe in climate change or not?' What we do know is that the climate is changing, what we do know is that we're building the tools, collectively, as Australians to adapt to that and what we do know is that our farmers are pragmatic. They're not getting stuck in the intellectual debate around climate change. What they're saying is: 'We see that it's drier on our farm. We see that we have different periods of dryâ€”and it may be because of historic reasons and that we're getting back to our long-term average rainfall, or it may be because of emissions in the air.' They don't really care. They care about how they farm, how they make a living and how we ensure the market's available to themâ€”how do we open up the financial products to them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also offer something that we haven't moved on and which I think we need to move on moreâ€”something that is taking place around the world. Saskatchewan in Canada has a drought insurance model, and I met with the USDA in Washington two years ago to discuss their arable drought insurance. 'Arable' is the word they use for broadacre cropping. We have yet to develop a really effective drought insurance model. I think that where we do need to landâ€”and I'll just put this on the recordâ€”is encouraging people to have an FMD of the same value as their interest component. So if they have a million-dollar debt and interest rates are at six per cent, they should have $60,000 parked in an FMD. If it's dry they can then realise that FMD and make an interest-only payment, which will keep the bank out of their way for that 12 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also encourage an input-only insurance product. So if they're running up a fee for fuel, wheat, seed or fertiliser, they should be able to take an insurance product against what they write out in fees. Then, when we get that dry year and they don't harvest anythingâ€”and I have harvested one bushel an acre myself. If anyone wants to check what a bushel is, it's a third of a bag. You can work that out, less the seed that I actually put in the ground. In those dry years, they should be able to get their input components back, service their loans with an FMD and then not be out of pocket. They can roll the dice again and set themselves up for another year, because the most important thing anyone must have at the end of a drought is ensuring that they're well placed for productivity so they can then go forward and produce, because it will rain. It does rain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To our farmers out there: we hear you and we're standing by you. To our farming families and those women out there in Australia, we pay tribute to you. It'll rain again and we'll be helping you until it does.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I rise to support the second reading amendment to the Farm Households Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 from my good friend and colleague the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Hunter, and salute his work in getting out there and listening to our farmers and being part of our Country Labor caucus. I'd also like to acknowledge my colleague the member for Malley. He's one of the few members in this place who does actually have a connection with farming as opposed to being a journalist, an accountant, a banker or what we call in New South Wales a Pitt Street farmer. As always, he made some valuable observations from the coalface, as we might say. I support this amendment because we believe that the farmers need a single up-front payment option. We call on the government to remove that two-part payment period to ensure that farmers aren't missing out on the supplementary payment due to the complexities of the application process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this bill. We will pass it. If we can also get this amendment, we'll be very happy with that. We should have bipartisan approaches to helping our farmers. I think we always do, by and large. I'm going to offer here today not political partisanship but some constructive criticism and suggestions, because this is part of that broader story of the conditions that are facing our farmers now. Like the member for Malley, my family have been dairy farming in the Bega Valley for over 170 years now. My great-great-grandfather founded the Bega Cheese Co-op and was the first chairman. Dairy farming requires a much-better-quality pasture than a lot of other country, where you can do marginal grazing and the like, so dairy farmers are doing it really tough. I was privileged to spend time in the agricultural and water portfolios when we were in government. I went up and down the Murray-Darling Basin, looking at the struggling farmers during that time. It is heartbreaking to see them having to go through this again. We all know the mental health issues that farmers go through in this environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of distinction for me is I'm not accepting any more that there's any kind of argument we can enter into about climate change. We have to convince some of the blockers on the other side of this chamber to get out of the way because we need to aggressively take on this climate change issue. We have to be able to prevent further catastrophic climate change. We can't see another two-degree increase. That should be a matter of bipartisan approach. I can't understand why it isn't. In every other significant OECD country, you get the conservative side of politics completely aligned with the progressive side. Angela Merkel, David Cameron, John Key, Theresa May and even Arnold Schwarzenegger are all over this. I don't get why we can't agree, particularly using the power of the market. I would've thought members opposite would embrace that. That was the potential that our farmers had. Under the clean energy future package that we were able to put in a government, the power of that market and the investment would have flowed to farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard about the Carbon Farming Initiative that we introduced. I know some of the measures of that have been preserved by the government, but not enough power is getting behind that investment. Agriculture takes up 53 per cent of the Australian landscape. The opportunity that farmers in agriculture offer for large-scale carbon sequestration in this country is huge. Apart from that, we know that getting carbon back into the soil is going to help restore its health. Over the two centuries that we've been here, we've been doing a lot of damage to soil health. There's no doubt about it. Laying on too much phosphate, pesticides and other things has definitely drawn down on the carbon store that we have in soils and eroded a lot of our landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have great farmers out there who are politically neutralâ€”they're not wheeling any barrow for any side of politicsâ€”who are doing great stuff in trying to push us forward. We have some great Nuffield scholars who have introduced techniques of stubble management, no-till farming and the like. You also have people like Tony Coote at the Mulloon Creek Natural Farms co-op out near Bungendore doing a lot of great stuff on absorbing and implementing the theories of natural sequence farming to rehydrate the landscape and slow down water through the landscape. If we're able to adopt those techniques then there's going to be no need for dams. As the member mentioned, in the kind of environment that we're seeing, with extreme weather and long periods of dry weather and then heavy falls, dams are not helping a hell of a lot. I must point out that we have to have health in our rivers and natural flushing flows through our rivers. Our fishers really depend on the health of the estuaries. I know only too well that in my region our fishers and oyster growers have to have a healthy river environment. Damming is not the answer to all of this. It gets back to, at the end of the day, better techniques in farming and that includes, as they're doing at Mulloon farms, slowing water down through the landscape and enabling the soil to retain that water much more effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard mention by the shadow minister of Charles Massy. He's a tremendous bloke. He's one of the Monaro farmers. He's got a PhD from the ANU and a BSC as well. He's an expert on what he's implementing on his farm. He terms it 'regenerative farming techniques', and it's working. He's getting carbon back in his soilâ€”it's helping to sequester carbonâ€”and he's making his property much more productive. He can show you a slide which is quite dramatic. It shows his fence line, and the difference between his property and the property next door is stark. He's trying to sell the techniques to other farmers. That's where the critical emphasis has to be now. We have to get the communication going. Fortunately, in our high country, the Monaro farmers, in the millennial drought, finally got together and formed Monaro Farming Systems. Through that, they were able to team up with the CSIRO to develop a computer modelling tool that will help them plan for a 50-year cycle on their properties to manage pastures and herds properly. That is also a great mental health prop as well. There is something to grab onto. Bringing them together in that aggregation also helped them to talk to each other and pass on scientific tips and farming techniques. This is what we've got to take countrywide: enable the farmers to aggregate and adopt the best science out there but also to take advantage of the proper carbon system that allows the investment that needs to flow to those farms. Under our Carbon Farming Initiative, for example, we were looking to enable farmers to aggregate, reforest parts of their properties, have a broker to manage that process and diversify the income on their farms. This is another thing we have to do: ensure resilience in farms by diversifying their incomes. Certainly, our Clean Energy Future package was helping in doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my region, forestry industry is a huge part of what we do. It's one of the largest forestry industry components in certainly any electorate in the state of New South Wales. More is needed and more can be provided to a growing sector of the economy for us. The busy pulp mill in Tumut wants to double in size and expand. They need another million tonnes of resources to do that. The Dongwha-TASCO sawmill near Bombala would like to expand into particle board manufacturing. Again, they need more resources. So I really welcome the shadow minister's announcement that he's committed to a review, with a view to modifying the water restrictions on the plantation investment strategies under the Carbon Farming Initiative. That's important because, normally with plantation resources, you'll only get a return on that at either a 10-year or a 25-year time line. But, with the Carbon Farming Initiative, you can have investors getting a return on their investment through the whole life of the forestry and plantation development and investment. I really welcome that. That's the sort of thing we need. We need aggressive action on climate change to save farmers from catastrophic climate change, but we also need to enable investment to flow into diversifying their farms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this was going to happen under the processes we established when we were in government. We looked at the exceptional circumstances regime and said, 'This is no longer exceptional circumstances. This is the world now.' We also knew from that, and I knew from my own experience, that inefficient farmers had their inefficiency covered up by the exceptional circumstances regime. You also had artificial lines on maps where a farmer on one side would say the Eurobodalla Shire was not getting the support a farmer in the Bega Valley Shire was getting. That was just arbitrary silliness. We took the exceptional circumstances regime to the Productivity Commission and had it reviewed and they came up with suggestions on how we could move forward in developing a regime that would actually empower farmers to deal with farming over the long term through dire circumstances. Following that, we set up the intergovernmental process, the COAG process and the Standing Council on Primary Industries to help develop and implement that strategy. But, unfortunately, the member for New England, who became the Minister for Agriculture, dismantled that whole SCoPI process under COAG, so we no longer had the implementation of those longer term drought reform measures. That's really very, very sad, and we have to get those mechanisms put back in place to make sure our farmers can be assisted and empowered in adopting those techniques that will help them to survive well into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, what we're still seeing missing from the government's policies is the restoration of that COAG drought policy reform process, action to help farmers adapt to climate change, and also giving farmers immediate access to this $12,000. It's also a bit disingenuous to claim this dollar value of the drought response by factoring in the capital value of loans when we know that these farmers are going to have to pay this back. Really, a loan approach to this is just no help right now. These farmers are not going to qualify for these loans. They're not going to be able to pay them back right now. The other thing that we've heard mentioned that is hurting them so badly is the denuding of human servicesâ€”the 2,500 staff who have gone from Centrelink, who were our frontline warriors in getting together with farmers and getting together with communities suffering from the effects of disasters and extreme weather events. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just look around you. In my own region we've had the earliest beginning to a fire season we've seen. Already there have been three homes lost near Bemboka, the Yankee Gap fire, off the back of what we saw was a late season fire tragedy in Tathra. We lost nearly 70 homes there. There was a great uniting across the chamber to respond to that crisis, but we need to raise the sights here. Look up. What's going on around the world right now? It is just smashing us in the face what's happening. There has got to be more urgency in doing something about this. We can no longer sit by and pretend that the science and the evidence isn't there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, the Climate Council has said that by 2030 we are going to need double the number of firefighters. With these overlapping fire seasons that we are seeing now, there is a real problem with the sharing of air assets between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. We're fighting fires here, and California is still burningâ€”and Sweden et cetera. So we are now going to have to revisit the issue of how we manage air asset support for fires. We might have to acquire our own capacity for a year-round threat. This is what we're being confronted with and what needs to be addressed by more serious national policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm also very concerned aboutâ€”and I particularly want to finish on thisâ€”is that we've seen the drought community's program announcement, the extension of that $75 million in funding. We've seen a list of about 60 eligible councils published today, and each of those councils will be getting $1 million of support for things like employing local contractors, undertaking repairs and maintenance, upgrading and building new community facilities, holding events and undertaking drought relief activities and the possible carting of potable water. I've got a list of all the New South Wales councils that are benefitting from this program. I have six councils in my electorate, which is 41,000 square kilometresâ€”in the top 15 in this chamber. Did Queanbeyan-Palerang Council get support? No. Yass Valley? No. Snowy Valley Council? No. Snowy Monaro? No. Bega Valley? No. Eurobodalla? No. Every single one of the six councils in my region received absolutely no help under this program, and I can tell you the mayors are really angry. They think this looks terribly like a political decision. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt hereâ€”I'm sure it wasn'tâ€”but I cannot see for the life of me how my six councils have been overlooked in this assistance, because they are hurting. They are red on the map; they are all red. They are all drought-declared and they all have farmers who are really doing it tough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to sit by and tolerate that. I call on the member for Groom to please revisit this, because those mayors are going to come knocking on his door and demand their inclusion. So let's take this opportunity to perhaps remedy what might have been an oversightâ€”I give all the benefit of the doubt here. But those six councils of mine need this help and they need it now. They should have been included on that list in the first place, if you just looked at the drought-affected map. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's make this a bipartisan approach to dealing with this crisis. Let's accept the second reading amendment that my colleague has proposed to make this more effective, in the immediate assistance the farmers need. But let's get serious, let's get real, about the true story behind all of thisâ€”effective policy on climate changeâ€”and not the circus we've seen over these last 10 years of climate change wars. It's got to end. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I support the passage of this Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 bill that will provide some relief to Australia's farmers. Australians are no strangers to drought. We've seen it before and undoubtedly we'll see it again. However, the severity of recent droughtsâ€”with the millennium drought etched firmly in our memories and the current drought on the eastern seaboard one of the worst on recordâ€”is having a devastating effect on our farmers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill allows more farmers to apply for the farm household allowance and provides those farmers with two lump sum payments worth up to $3,600 each. While this provides some small immediate relief, the government still needs to address the biggest issues facing Australia's agricultural sectorâ€”climate change, energy costs and, I would also say, dealing with the banks. The first to feel the real impact of climate change are our farmers. The fact that the government continues to be so bitterly divided on energy and climate change policy and yet claims to be addressing farmers' concerns is deeply frustrating for the agricultural sector, a sector which contributes $60 billion to Australia's economy every year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One-off payments to farmers will not prevent future droughts and will not address the systemic, surrounding skyrocketing power prices. I call upon the government to show real leadership and not just pay lip-service to the incredibly difficult challenges Australia's agricultural sector are facing. I also call on the government to address the unconscionable lending practices by banks to small primary-production businesses. Primary producers are so often at the mercy of factors far beyond their control. Family farmers hope to make profits over a multi-year cycle, using good years and what we're seeing now as bad years to build their financial buffer, to see them through the bad. These primary producers are capital rich and income poor, and their ability to pay their creditors is reliant upon long-term profit cycles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banks are not always accommodating to the challenges faced by farmers, and we've seen that with the royal commission. They often only give the minimum notice for sudden and unilateral variations to loan agreements. Revaluations of assets are undertaken during downturns, when asset prices are at their lowest, and as a means to call in the loan and force the farmer off the loan book. Earlier this year I introduced the Banking Amendment (Rural Finance Reform) Bill 2018, which took a reasoned and measured approach to levelling the field between the lender and the lendee. And now that I'm fortunate enough to be back in my role I'll be seeking to re-table that bill. The government has refused to even debate the bill let alone put it to a vote. How can you call yourself the party for farmers if you are not going to address the inequity that lies between bankers and farmers? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposals in this bill are long overdue and they will provide assistance to farmers in the short-term. Lifting farm asset tests from $2.55 million to $5 million will allow more farmers to access the farm household allowance, providing them with up to $16,000 per year in income support. It is support that I know farmers don't want to take, but if they need money we must provide it for them. The two lump-sum payments, each worth up to $3,600, will provide immediate relief with rising bills, but lowering power prices would provide so much more real and long-term assistance. And that's what we're talking aboutâ€”long-term assistance on energy prices, on climate change and on banking behaviour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the passage of this legislation. The measures will provide some short-term relief for Australia's farmers, and that is important. More important is the government standing up for rural Australia and meaningfully addressing the real issues that are forcing families that have worked on the land for generations to sell their farms. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  This drought is biting right across New South Wales and also Queensland and indeed other parts of Australia. It is hitting the communities of central western New South Wales especially hard. It is an awful drought and it is taking an awful toll on all of our communitiesâ€”our farmers, our farming families and our country communities. It is not just the farms that are being affected; it is the whole community. We are seeing an economic slowdown which is really taking a toll right across the business sector as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The farm household allowance is an important relief measure. It is a vital relief measure. That's why I speak to support the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 this evening. Basically the farm household allowance puts food on the table and diesel in the ute when farmers just don't have any income because of the ravages of drought. It's worth around $530 to $580 per fortnight for singles and just under $1,000 per fortnight for couples. With this bill, we are seeing additional funding go into it, including $12,000 in grants, which is, I think, really important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another feature of this bill which I think is important is that the assets test threshold has been widened to $5 million. Previously it was around $2.5 million. This was one of the big issues which farmers had raised with me concerning the farm household allowanceâ€”that most of them weren't eligible for it. By widening the asset threshold and raising it, you are going to get thousands more people eligible to apply. I think that's a great thing because the constant feedback that I have had from communities right around the central west is that that assets threshold needs to be adjusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that farmers have is that it's just so difficult to fill in those forms. I note that this week the Australian government is taking steps to make it easier to apply for the farm household allowance and to streamline the process. This is a constant source of irritation to farmers. The drought takes a huge emotional toll. There is no rain, the paddocks are bare and you've got farmers and their families going out, day in and day out, feeding, checking dams and checking troughs. It's very time consuming. It's very labour intensive. The last thing our farmers need to be saddled with is more forms and red tape. Indeed, I've had farmers actually take photographs of the pile of forms that they have to fill in to access the farm household allowance. So I'm very pleased that efforts are being made to streamline it. I think it's really important, and it is the least that we can do for our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also very pleased that the federal government has just announced more badly needed drought relief measures. Drought relief can't exist as a static thing in time. You can't just put out a package and say: 'Yes, we're done. Here is our drought relief package.' It's got to move and change as conditions worsen, and they are worsening. This season is shaping up to be a very ugly one. So I was very pleased to see these new drought relief measures announced just recently, including for the National Drought Coordinator, Major General Stephen Day. I think that his presence will help coordinate all of these parties, because there does need to be coordination across the state governments, federal government and also private enterprise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to see that primary producers will now be allowed to immediately deduct rather than depreciate over a number of years the cost of fodder storage assets, such as silos and hay sheds. That's a good thing. Doubling the amount a farmer can borrow in low-interest loans to $2 million across a 10-year loan term with interest-only repayments for the first five years helps. Farmers will access that. The additional $23.7 million to improve drought resilience by expanding the great artesian bore capping program is a positive thing as well, as is the special drought round under the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund that will provide up to $72 million for water infrastructure projects. There's $2.7 million for the Bureau of Meteorology to develop new finer scale regional weather and climate guides. Again, that's a positive step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that I touched on previously is the bolstering of staffing levels at Centrelink to ensure farms are supported when applying for the farm household allowance. This will include phone access capacity, which will allow farmers to complete a claim over the phone and just make the whole process simpler and easier. I'll touch on an aspect of that shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One initiative that was part of the package was the Drought Communities Program, which provides $1 million to councils to help communities affected by drought with local infrastructure projects and drought relief activities. I think this is an important initiative, because it recognises that it's not just the farm which is being affected by this awful drought but the farming communities and our country communitiesâ€”our country towns and villages. Everyone in our region is being hit by this, so it is an important initiative. But, when it was announced, there were some notable omissions. I include Bathurst Regional Council, Lithgow City Council and Orange City Council in that. Two that do host significant farming communities are Bathurst and Lithgow. They have significant farming communities in their local government areas, so, as soon as this announcement was made, I got on the phone to the responsible minister, the member for Groom, to highlight this problem. He understood my frustrationâ€”that there were drought-affected communities that weren't on the list. I think the issue is the bureaucratic process here, not the minister. To his credit, the minister has undertaken to work with me to fix it, and I'm confident he will. He's a good man, an effective minister and a great friend of the Central West. However, the situation isn't acceptable when everyone in the Central West is getting hammered and is suffering under this drought. This situation needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency. We need to get cracking on it, and I urge all parties to do just that. We need to get this issue sorted out on the double.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue which needs to be sorted out quickly is that of the rural financial counsellors. I was very pleased to see recently an additional $5 million for rural financial counsellors. I visited the counsellor in Mudgee recently. She is now booked out for three weeks. There's a counsellor in Mudgee and in Young, and there are counsellors in Dubbo too, but we need more support on the Central Tablelands now to service Lithgow, Oberon, Bathurst, Orange and the Cabonne area. The funding is there. There's an additional $5 millionâ€”that's a good thing. I welcome the announcement. Now we've just got to get the counsellors on the ground. We need boots on the ground and we need them ASAP. I've spoken to the folks who run the counselling service out of Dubbo and I understand that an application for funding has been made, but I would encourage everyone who has some input into this process to get it crackingâ€”to expedite itâ€”because we need to get this help on the ground where it's needed, on the double.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everywhere I go in the Central Westâ€”I've been visiting a lot of farms and speaking to a lot of farmersâ€”the mental toll it's taking is huge. People are worried about their family members, and it's hurting. The last thing that farmers need to worry about is trying to work out whether they're eligible for a program or whether they can get relief, because they're coming in late after long, awful soul-destroying days. We need to get them the help. That's the least that we can do for them. We need to work out the feed situation here and support them to get the feed and fodder to where they need itâ€”get the grain going. That's what I'm hoping the new drought coordinator can do, because we need to get the grain to where it's needed. At the moment, it's not coming into the Central West of New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Grain is in extremely short supply. There have been some big buy-ups in recent weeks, with hundreds of thousands of tonnes taken off the market. WA is going to have a bumper seasonâ€”and thank the Lord they areâ€” but we need to get the grain from there over into the Central West of New South Wales. We need it on the double. I'm hoping the drought coordinator can get private enterprise, the New South Wales government and the federal government all in a room together to sort out how we can do it and who's doing what, because, at the moment, the grain just isn't arriving. Farmers are now being charged upwards of $500 a tonne, and it's uneconomic to feed in that situation. All of the work they've done to this date, by making feedlot on their places and storing the grain and the hay, will all be for nothing if they can't continue to feed. We need to get this sorted ASAP. I would encourage all farmers to speak to their local members and drought coordinators, state and federal, to raise these issues and make the decision-makers aware of the importance of this project in terms of getting the grain. It's urgent and we need it quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need fodder. We need the hay. There has been some discussion in this House about the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder making water available so that farmers, especially in the southern reaches of the state and into Victoria, can actually finish fodder and actually irrigate the hay. The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder has a huge holding of water. It's being held as environmental water. I don't think the farmers are asking for much. We need to be looking out of the box and thinking a little bit differently about how we can get feed and fodder to the farmers. Getting not huge amounts of water, but enough so that they can irrigate the fodder, would be a really helpful start. So I would encourage all parties, including the drought coordinator, to get moving on that, because it's urgent and it can't wait for a long bureaucratic process. We need this help now. This needs to be delivered now. We need to get this sorted out now. We need to get the million-dollar grants to council sorted out because this is pressing and it's going to get a whole lot worse. There's a real urgency about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So many people around our region have rallied to the cause to help our farmers. If you can take away anything from this adversity, it shows the Australian spirit. The Australian spirit shines through in times like these because in country communities we care about each other. But it's not just the country communities caring; this is the whole of Australia. For example, in the Mudgee area, Will Bateman and Glenn Box have this program called 200BALES, which is a campaign to get hay to farmers. It gives people or businesses the opportunity to give a bale of hay to one of the farmers in the local area who are struggling during these dry times. I was actually at a farm about a week ago, and the farmer, who hadn't asked for it, suddenly received some bales under this program, and it just lifted their spirits. It made them aware that the community was caring. Although they were not looking for a handout, the bales were there and they were really grateful for it. It did make a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All around the central west there are many, many stories of the community pulling together. East Orange Public School students have been raising money to help farmers in the region. They've actually been cooking. They've had an out-of-uniform day. They're hoping to raise around $1,000. They've got an appeal on. They're selling cupcakes. All of the students are involved in it. There are also local businesses. Sierra Leone Hair and Beauty threw open its doors recently, donating all of the money raised from people getting haircuts to drought relief. Rebecca Childs, who runs a hair business called Hair at Home, said the idea was just a silly idea about a week ago, and it just picked up steam. These are everyday people working out what they can do to help drought-affected communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is important legislation. I support the legislation, but there is more work to do, and we need to be doing everything we can to ramp up drought support, because more relief and assistance measures are going to be needed. This drought shows no sign of breaking any time soon, and we need to keep ramping it up and supporting the farmers who have supported us through lean economic times recently. We need to now have their backs and support them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I rise, as part of the Labor team, to support the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018. I've listened carefully to many of the speakers in this debate and I think we are at one in understanding how important the Farm Household Support Act is. I'll come to that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I want to say that I come to this debate wearing several hats. As the shadow minister for families and social services, and, until recently, the shadow minister for human services, I have a great deal of interest in the way in which this particular measure works within the social security system. I also come to this discussion as the member for Barton, which is in southern Sydney. But I grew up in the country. I grew up in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, in a tiny little hamlet called Whitton. The whole economy of that town depended on farms doing well, because most of the people who lived there were farmhands in the area. I also come to this debate as someone who was raised by my great-uncle, who was a drover and a stockman on Kooba Station, which was the big station not far from where I grew up. I grew up, as I said, in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. I lived across the road from rice farms. I remember well the importance of the irrigation system, and I spent many, many hours of my youth playing in the rice farms, in the stubble once the rice was cut, building forts and so forth. So I well understand the issues around farming. I want to make sure people understand that in this discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes to amend the Farm Household Support Act 2014. The act provides support for eligible farmers and their partners, including one-on-one case support, an activity supplement for planning and training, and an income support payment. I think it's really important to listen to the speakers in this particular debateâ€”that, whilst this is one measure, it is certainly not the only measure that both the government and the opposition have announced around this protracted drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The drought has many people, in the city and in the country, working towards providing relief for the drought and, in particular, for farming families. I can only imagine the heartbreak for farming families that have spent years and years building up their herds and their properties, only to see something that's completely out of their control having such a devastating effectâ€”and that is drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drought is not a new phenomenon, of course, for Australia, the second driest continent on earth. It is a part of what we understand. But we also understandâ€”and it's undeniableâ€”that climate change is having a terrible effect, not only in Australia but right across this world, to the point where you would have to ask whether some parts of this blue planet are going to be habitable into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Farm Household Support Act provides support for eligible farmers, as I said: one-on-one case support, an activity supplement for planning and training, and an income support payment. This bill will extend the period of support from three years to four years, which underpins the length of time it will take for many farmers to recover. The bill will also increase the farm asset limit from $2.635 million to $5 million, and that's an important element of this particular measure. This bill will also introduce a new two-part payment supplement to qualifying farm household allowance recipients. Labor believes that farmers should be able to receive the two-part payment in one single lump sum, which will get support to farmers who need it urgently. I understand that that is not going to be possible, but I'll obviously take advice on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers make a tremendous contribution to the economy and to Australian society. It is part of the cultural milieu of Australia and it is very much a part of how Australia has grown. Labor believes that farmers should be able to receive the two-part payment in one lump sum. Farmers' resilience is not only inspiring; it puts food on our tables and has had an enormous impact on the economic fortunes of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that farmers are a proud people. We know that many will be reluctant to accept assistance. I say to farmers who are really in need of assistance to try and think about this not as charityâ€”it is not charityâ€”it is what you are eligible for and it is a temporary measure. In that context, it is very, very appropriate and important that farmers access this assistance. To those farmers second-guessing whether they should accept assistance, I would say: don't wait for things to get really, really past the point of being able to be fixed. If you're eligible for assistance, please use it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Calare made the points about how challenging these forms are. We know that many farmers who are eligible for this assistance have not accessed it. We know that 15,000 farmers, or two-thirds of eligible farmers, have not taken up farm household allowance. I think part of it is pride, and perhaps part of it is the exhaustion that we have heard spoken about so passionately in this House tonight. But there is no doubt that the bureaucracy and the length and the complexity of the forms is making it extremely difficult to access. Many have found the application process so complex they are simply not applying for assistance. We know that many Australians are finding it more and more difficult to contact and access Centrelink, and this includes the farm household allowance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past two years, the government has cut 2,500 staff from the Department of Human Services, which administers Centrelink and therefore the farm household allowance. We have seen payment wait times increase and we've seen phone wait times also increase, once again, making it extremely difficult for farmers to make contact and get some clarification about the complexity and what they need to do to qualify for these forms. This is not appropriate in this time of need. The government has already begun to outsource 2,500 Centrelink jobs to labour-hire firms as a bandaid response to the blow-out in wait times. Income support is complex, and that's why it's so important for Centrelink to have permanent full-time staff who are properly trained to assist with complex matters arising in income support. This is one such matter. Labor believes all Australians, including our farmers, should be able to access help if or when they need it. They shouldn't be forced to wait or go without. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers are incredibly tough and resilient people. This is a long and difficult drought. We are now entering our eighth year of drought. I was talking to the minister the other day who said that there seems to be very little relief in sight. This is some such relief, and farmers should not have to worry about difficulties of navigating a complex bureaucratic process. This month Labor announced it would boost Centrelink staff numbers by 1,200 permanent, full-time, qualified and well-trained staff. We will deploy 100 specifically trained Centrelink community response officers to go out and provide face-to-face assistance to those facing drought, including two additional mobile service centres, doubling the current capacity. This means these mobile centres can actually go to where there is a crisis. It might not be droughtâ€”it might be flood or it might be some other difficult situationâ€”but it means that there is a doubling of the resources in terms of mobile service centres. They will guide those requiring assistance through the application process as well as assess for any further assistance that may be required, including financial counselling and health services. We cannot forget that those things are important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as people have point out, it is not just farmers but it is communities that rely on farmers to be doing well, particularly things like service stations and other businesses in towns that are in rural and regional New South Wales. This will help to ensure that farmers are receiving the necessary assistance as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague, the member for Hunter, has so rightly pointed out, this drought will require a coherent, long-term drought policy. It will require broader discussion about the government's commitment to address climate changeâ€”I know other people have spoken about that at length. For now, we need to focus on ensuring that farmers receive the assistance they need so that they can focus on getting through the drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish by once again reiterating that this is not charity. This is not a handout. This is assistance that you as a farmer have a right to, and it is a temporary measure, so please access it. I know that there is pride involved. I know that many farmers are not used to this kind of process. I know that it is a difficult process, but it is your right.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  I stand here a little bit disappointed that the government isn't going to support the amendment that has been put forward by the opposition in relation to the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018, particularly the ability for farmers to get a single up-front payment of $12,000. From what we've heard from people on the ground, in the areas affected, the ability to get that payment now will help them get through the crisis that they're in right now, because so many of them are struggling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of the amendment that the government is not supporting, which I find really disappointing, is the prioritising of the rebuilding of the COAG process that was dismantled in 2013, when this mob were elected, in order to restore the process to develop the National Drought Policy Reform Program. We are in this crisis because the government has failed on multiple fronts when it comes to drought reform policy, Centrelink, farm household support and the entire program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a few journalists writing about the fact that there are more Victorian farmers currently accessing the farm household support loans and allowance than there are in New South Wales, even though New South Wales has been declared 100 per cent drought-affected. I'm not surprised by that. When I've been on the ground talking to various different farmers, they have said the processing has slowed a lot of them down. It's the complex paperwork. It's the fact that, when they ring Centrelink to try and get help, they're stuck on the phone for an hour only to get through to someone who works in a call centre for Serco who's a generalist and has no idea of the complex nature of this paperwork and who puts them on hold for a further amount of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've known for many years that it is hard to get this paperwork done. This government has failed to address those concerns on its watch. It has failed to make the system easier. Only now is it starting to put forward some reforms which can actually help. It's not like the government can say, 'We didn't know,' because the opposition has raised this several times. We've asked this question several times, and the government blamed financial counsellorsâ€”in fact, it actually shut down the financial counselling services in my part of the world. We had an office in Bendigo, and it was shut down. The government said it was doing a review, and the resources were pushed elsewhere, so now our farmers in Bendigo don't have access to that support. They have to travel or the financial counsellors have to travel further to go to the farmers in my part of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial counsellors are a big part of helping people through this complex paperwork. But I should also note that it's not only farmers that have to complete complex paperwork. Many people in this place have probably met with people trying to access aged-care services and home care services. There's a lot of paperwork involved in trying to receive any form of government assistance. It's just the complication that this government has imposed on Australians, because of the lack of trust that it has for people. They talk about red tape, and they came in here with all that fanfare, 'We're going to reduce red tape.' Yet all they've done, particularly in areas like our social welfare state, is to create more paperwork and make it even harder for people to access assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the government has really been failing in this area and we know that they've really struggled to understand the complexity of why the farm household support program isn't being accessed, because the former minister responsible for agriculture misspoke in the parliament in that kind of tragic moment and then doctored, corrected or suggested corrections to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record which completely altered his original statement. It demonstrates again just how out of touch this government is. Just turning up with the cameras to do a roadshow tour isn't enough. It's not what people in the regions are looking for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge that there are a number of farmers who don't access this: (1) because of the complicated paperwork; (2) as the former member mentioned, because of pride; and (3) because they think that they've got their drought planning right. There is really mixed experience in people in the agricultural industry when it comes to drought and the drought effect. Some of them did do their planning after the millennial drought. They have destocked, they have planned for drought and they are now working through that plan, knowing ahead of time that it was going to be tough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of them have spoken publicly in the media about how they're doing fine because they planned for drought and they were ready, but that now they've got what they call survivor guilt because they did plan, because they were smart economic managers and because they were ready for it. They spoke about their frustration from being depicted as being out-of-touch cocky farmers who don't know how to manage their affairs. We have to be sensitive in this area, to not demonise all. We have to be compassionate and understanding and support those people, and that's what this bill seeks to do. But we also have to congratulate and acknowledge those who've succeeded in their planning and prepared themselves for this drought.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We desperately need to get the National Drought Policy Reform Program back on track. The fact that we have those opposite still denying the effects of climate change whilst we're debating this bill this week is just extraordinary. It's the fact that they're not even taking the proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which we know affect the environment, seriously. It's is just extraordinary. It's just extraordinary that they have completely dropped the ball when it comes to real action on climate change. It's just so disappointing that they can't even work with the farmers and their core constituency, who are saying: 'This is a result, we know the effects of climate change are really having an impact on agriculture. If you want us to be the economic powerhouse for our country, then we need to work more collaboratively when it comes to drought policy and drought policy reform.' The reason why it needs to be done through COAG is because the states have a number of other policy levers that they can work on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked about water security a lot when we were in the regions. It's quite topical in parts of Victoria and all throughout New South Wales and Queensland. I've had the opportunity to hold agricultural workforce roundtables. At the end of the discussions, I always ask: 'What else is there? What else is on the agenda?' And it doesn't matter whether you're a mango farmer, a sheep farmer or a cotton farmer, and it doesn't matter which area of agriculture you're involved in, they all say, 'Waterâ€”water security is critical.' Water security is linked to drought-proofing. It is linked to drought policy and the need for us, as a nation, to have a constructive conversation about water security and water storage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some amazing things that our agricultural industry is doing in relation to water security, water storage and the way in which they're using less water to grow more. We have some real innovation going on in areas of our ag sector. Where are the resources to get behind that?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we know there's going to be less rainwater, what's our plan? We need to restart the National Drought Policy Reform Program through COAG to bring all of the core constituencies together to work on a national plan. That is what we need to do in the long term. We need to be proactive about this. What we need to be doing in the short term is working with these communities. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am disappointed to learn that the funding going to local councils, under this government, appears not to be party blind. There is funding going to Liberal and National seats but not to Labor seats. That is disappointing. The member for Eden-Monaro has said that is disappointing. In Eden-Monaro drought is a problem. These councils have missed out. Nobody is denying it's a problem in New England. Nobody is denying it's a problem in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. But it's a problem in every state, including in every area of New South Wales, regardless of who the elected representative is. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the minister across the table is saying that it is resolved, that will be welcome news to those shires. It's not just the farmers who struggle in a drought. It is also the businesses that support those farmers. It is the communities that rally around those farmers. That is something a lot of rural financial counsellors have raised with me, the effects of drought. If the crops aren't coming in, then the farmers don't have money to spend in the local shops. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A very interesting comment came out of the CWA in one of the affected communities. They said, 'While it's nice to receive donations, it means that people don't go to the local shop anymore.' I think that was a little comment towards saying to people in the metro areas: 'Ask us what support we need; ask us what work we need help with.' What we're hearing when we're talking to people is that they want to see cooperation and collaboration. They don't just want handouts. They want long-term reform that really focuses on how as a country, and how as communities, and how as an industry we can ensure we areâ€”as best as possibleâ€”drought-proofing, going forward. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a final few comments about Centrelink and how this government could have avoided this disaster of people not being able to complete their paperworkâ€”if only they'd hired more people. If they had just employed more people within Centrelink this entire problemâ€”the fact that there are more people in Victoria on the allowance than there are in New South Walesâ€”could have been avoided. If only this government hadn't cut so many people from DHS. I have a smart centre in my electorate. It's good to have people working for Centrelink in the smart centre of my electorate, because we're a regional community. You have people who work at Centrelink who also have a farm. They understand farming. One partner works for Centrelink, the other runs the farm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you live in regional communities, particularly where you've got a big population centre like Bendigo, there are a lot of farming families where one parent will work in a teaching job, or in the Bendigo Bank or in Centrelink, and the other will work on the farm. So they have that dual income. It's really critical that when the farmer rings for assistance, to try and get support through the farm household assistance, when they speak to a directly employed person, someone working in my electorate, there's some understanding and sympathy for what the farmer's going through. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to social services, this government has really dropped the ball. Whilst it's great to see change now for our farmers, I do have to ask the question: why stop there? Why not continue to employ more people and make the process easier for our pensioners? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why aren't we making the process easier for people trying to access home-care packages or aged-care services? Why are we not making sure that we're investing more resources into the NDIA so that people can get access and support when they've got questions about their complex NDIS plans for their loved ones? Why aren't we now seeing reform there? If there's the acknowledgement that Centrelink doesn't have the capacity right now to help and to work with people then the government should not stop with just farmers but should roll this out across the board.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we truly want to be a country that has a strong agricultural sector that continues to export our agricultural produce, whether it be the base commodity or the value-added product, then we do need to get serious about national drought policy. We do need to do all that we can to support our farmers, our agricultural communities and the associated industries so that the effects of droughts can be reduced as much as possible. Congratulations to those who are doing well and are supporting others. As other speakers have done, I encourage those who need assistance to seek help.</span>

                    <a href="E5D" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  One of the greatest frustrations we have is that, every time we talk about drought, the Labor Party talk about climate change. I've got no problem with them talking about climate change, but that is hardly what is going to suffice for someone who is doing it so tough. You turn up and give them a sermon about climate change when you know full well there is not a policy in Australia that is actually going to have, by itself, an effect on the climate. It's something that most people find completely galling. You go to a house where they can't afford groceries and they can't keep the dignity of their life and you say, 'What the Australian Labor Party is offering you is no more than a sermon'â€”a sermon about a belief in how the people of Woolloomooloo or St Kilda have primacy over the future of regional Australia. That is basically it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tamworth we have had, in imperial measurement, which most farmers work by, a little better than four inches of rain. There is another part of the world that has four inches of rain annually: Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. So we are living in a desert environment. It is peculiar, it is unusual and it most likely has a lot to do with the changing climate, but what we have to deal with is the crisis of now. What the Farm Household Allowance does by raising the cap to $5 million in net equity is give more people access to a payment that will keep dignity in their life. It's a payment that will allow them to go to the chemist and pay the chemist bill; it will allow them to pay the grocery bill; it will allow them to keep the phone on. These things are so vitally important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the coalition started and I was the minister, only 367 people had access to Farm Household Allowance. Three hundred and sixty-seven peopleâ€”that is the number that was given to me. By the end, we had over 7,100 people. This again extends the number of people who have access to it. Not only does it do that but, with a further $12,000, it also gives people the capacity to access a lump sum. The challenge of this chamber and one of the greatest issues before our nation at the moment is to come up with a policy debate in this chamber. We heard so many theatrics today. I listened to them. I know we're partly responsible for it and so is the other side. But there is not one person dealing with the drought who thinks that is of relevance to them. They're looking for us to talk about their lives. They're looking for a question time where the questions that go back and forth are about the stringency and the competition of ideas in policy to deal with the drought. That is why, in this nation, there's a disconnect from this crazy boarding school. People see you not talking about them; you're talking about this place. We've got to make sure this drought is the No. 1 issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Out there in the public, the people in Sydneyâ€”even those in the suburbsâ€”see it as one of the biggest issues for them. They're not affected by the drought, but they are definitely affected by the empathy for people who are in drought and they want to make sure that our nation does the very best for them. They might even gain more respect for us as a body if we made this our focus. In the recent election of Longman, less than 70 per cent voted for the two major parties. So 30 per cent of people basically voted for no-one because they fear we're disconnected. The drought gives us the capacity to get back on the front foot, to do the right thing by people in the country and to make sure that they see us as relevant in their lives. The Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 is part of doing precisely that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear about issues to deal with drought and water storageâ€”drought, by its very essence, is lack of water. Surely one of the fundamental parts of a drought policy would be the construction of large water storages and the facilitation of farms for smaller water infrastructure. We did that in the past with water infrastructure grants, and it was well supported. When we put forward money for the construction of dams, there were two things that worked against us. One, to be quite frank, was that the Labor Party wanted to take basically half the money away. They don't have the vision for this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other section is the green lobby groups. Every time we try to do something for this nation, a group of people who are predominantly well paid, who have been the beneficiaries of this nation and who are probably well-educatedâ€”as a group, the highest income earners in Australiaâ€”work against us trying to make this nation a stronger place. Nathan Dam, which in Queensland has been discussed since the 1920sâ€”I think 1928â€”has 770,000 megalitres. The reason we couldn't get that started for a long time was because of the boggomoss snail. I have great respect for the boggomoss snail, but I believe this was just a mechanism to create a caveat that stands in the proxy for inertia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate, in Tamworth, we went for the extension of Chaffey Dam from 60,000 megalitres to 100,000 megalitres, but there was the Booroolong frog. I was always of the opinion that frogs liked water. I thought if we gave them more water we should have more frogs and happier frogs, but, of course, there was an argument of inertia. On the road between Limbri and Weabonga that goes up in the hills next to where I grew up, the road fell into the creek. It fell into the creek, but for years they could not fix it. You know why? Because of the Booroolong frog. This frog is a threat to our nation. I had a look at its range. Its range is from northern Victoria to southern Queensland. I believe one of the greatest external threats that we have in this nation is the Booroolong frog. It could stop anything. It's part of the green agenda that we have to stand up against if we want this nation to take the next step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the farm household allowance, these things work together. We have to make sure that during this drought we do our part in assisting farmers. We can't make it rain, but we can create dignity in people's houses. You've got to remember that before the farm household allowance, farmers were not entitled to anything because their asset base was too high. Other people got unemployment benefits, but they got nothing. They literally had no money. This is part of a drought package and so vitally important. It works hand in glove with other things we are doing for the drought. I would like to say to those who are listening to this tonight that there are about a million dollars we are giving to councils in drought areas. It's vitally important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, to assist with drought, we built dog fences in western Queensland to exclude dogs from the area and to try to get sheep back into these areas, and to give something with a legacy that works into the future. We've also put further money on the table for the GABSI scheme. This is the piping and capping of one of our nation's most vital assets, the Great Artesian Basin. It is so vital that in the past we lost about 95 per cent of the water in bore drainsâ€”which is really just an urban ditchâ€”through evaporation and absorption. This is a huge vital saving of that vital asset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For some of that waterâ€”when it comes up, when we do the testing on itâ€”the last time it saw sunlight was millions of years ago. We are taking a water resource from millions of years ago in some instances. It must be treated with respect because we might be taking it from a wetter period of our nation. We have got to be vastly aware. What the Commonwealth is doing as part of this drought package is to make sure that there is further capping of this resource, so it doesn't just flow out and evaporate. It is too valuable for that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not only farmers that find this important; it is also towns. There are many towns, especially in Western Queensland, for whom that's their water supply. I lived for a long time in St George. We lived on water from the Great Artesian Basin. In summer, you had a peculiar circumstance. You would never run out of hot water. You would run out of cold water, because all the water is hot. Actually, in many instances, you turn the hot water system off and run the water into the hot water system for cold water, and the taps worked back to front. If we lost that resource, it would be decimating to so many areas of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the farm household allowance, which we are debating tonight, each lump sum payment will be $3,000 per person for members of a couple, and $3,600 in all other circumstances. This means if both members of a couple are receiving the farm household allowance, between 1 September 2018 and 1 June 2019, they will receive $6,000 each or $12,000 per household. In all other circumstances, the amount payable will be $7,200. That's substantial money. It's not enough money to get yourself through the drought, pay for the fodder and basically keep feeding the stock, but it will keep dignity in that house. I want to commend the minister and those in the government who have worked to provide this. The drought is a dynamic situation, and we must always be mindful of what the next step is. What are we going to do? How do we make sure that this national crisis is dealt with as a national crisis? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding tonight, I will say this: during a bushfire, people can come onto your place, they can take your bulldozer and say, 'We need it to fight the bushfire. We are basically requiring it for the bushfire,' and you comply. During a bushfire they say, 'Look, we're going to have to cut your fences to get access to where the fire is.' During a bushfire, they have the capacity and the authority to back-burn through your place, because they've got to put the fire out. During a bushfire basically laws are put aside because of the common sense that in a crisis, you have to deal with it in this form. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the graces of being on the backbench is to propose policy that I think we should consider. This is a national crisis, and a national crisis means that basically the laws as they currently stand have to take into account the crisis that we are dealing with. The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder holds billions of dollars' worth of water. It holds it for the purpose of watering environmental assetsâ€”environmental assets which during the drought would not get water if we had a purely natural environment. Remember: during a drought, many rivers that are actually flowing would be dry because the regulated capacity of dams wouldn't be there. Beside me is the member for Parkes and above him is the Copeton Dam, and then it runs down through the Gwydir River. The Gwydir River wouldn't have water in it if it didn't have regulated flow. It would be bone dry. The Peel River right now would be like an environment similar to Saudi Arabia. It would be bone dry. But it flows. It flows because of regulated water. It flows also because of environmental water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to ask a question. This is a one-in-100-year event and we should be considering that the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder's asset be used for the production of fodder, of lucerne, to finish off crops, to make sure that in the Gwydir Valley we finish up a cotton crop, because amongst other things we use the cotton seed for cattle feed. Down south, we want the water for lucerne. We can get high-protein grain across from Western Australia, but we need a fodder component. If we don't really deal with this as the crisis which it is then we will not be doing the right thing by our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, instead of using lucerne and other fodder from southern Australia, we are using products from the northern parts, from Queenslandâ€”Rhodes Grass that comes in from the Lockyer Valley and other products from around Dalby. There is a word of caution with this. Anything that comes from Central Queensland has the potential to come in with Parthenium weed. If we move Parthenium weed onto the black soil of the Liverpool Plains it will take strike and it will work its way across. If we move it into Walgett, in the member for Parkes's electorate, it will create massive problems. The Lockyer Valley also has another problemâ€”fire ants. If we move fire ants around our nation, we will be doing it a great disservice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I support the farm household allowance. I have been involved with it in its former iterations. But this is a national crisis. We must treat it as a national crisis and we must be bold enough and brave enough to go forward and use the resources that are at our disposal to deal with it as a national crisis.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018. I have lived in a rural area all my life. I was a farmer for 33 years before I came here. I've been through quite a few droughts. I may have seen one or two as bad as this one, but I certainly haven't seen one worse. We are heading into uncharted territory. I think what makes this one so particularly difficult is it covers such a large area. Normally in a dry season graziers have an option to find pockets of feed for agistment by sending livestock to another area. Generally there would be grain or hay available from a more immediate area. This year, because the entire eastern side of Australia west of the range is in droughtâ€”from Central Queensland right down to Victoria, including my electorateâ€”it's become particularly difficult. So I am in support of these changed measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It needs to be pointed outâ€”and the member for New England touched on itâ€”that the household support is to provide the basic significant essentials for a farm family. It's food on the table, school uniforms for the kids and maybe fuel for the carâ€”those basic essentialsâ€”so that, when things are particularly tight financially, one of those concerns about looking after your family is removed. So the extra funding, the extra $12,000 per couple because of the exceptional circumstances, will be greatly appreciated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other change is the extra money going into the Rural Financial Counselling Service. That is the key organisation in helping these farm families access the support they need. I think the message is getting through, but in the earlier days of the drought there was a lot of misinformation going around on social media discouraging people from actually applying for this support, saying that it would be too hard. Now, thankfully, that message is getting through and people are applying, but that is putting extra tension on the staff of the Rural Financial Counselling Service. There is provision in here for more staff. That recruitment is happening now, but that's an important recruitmentâ€”you can't just pull people off the street and turn them into rural financial counsellors. So we need those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some other changes were announced this week. I just want to pay tribute to my senior colleagues. I've been around this place now for over a decade. I've got to say that I have never seen a greater interest in the affairs of regional Australia through a drought than I have in the last couple of months. Our Prime Minister, our Deputy Prime Minister, our ag minister, our regional telecommunications minister and our regional development and local government minister have all been hands-on. The Prime Minister has been in my electorate twice. He's been out for drought tours, I think, four times. As a matter of fact, the Prime Ministerâ€”it might be pertinent tonight to remind people of some of the things our Prime Minister has doneâ€”has actually been personally ringing some of my most affected constituents not only to offer comfort but to ask for direction as to what they might be looking for. I want to put that on the record tonight, and I think that tonight, of all times, it's probably more pertinent that that recognition is made. Our entire senior ministry, including the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for agriculture, have done a sterling job on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This drought is difficult. We're taking the edge off it, but the idea that we can take the tension and the stress out of drought is just not plausible. There are funds in this amendment for more mental health support. That can be delivered just as community forums, like a barbecue get-together and an opportunity for people to socialise. I remember that in 1992 we were in a particularly bad drought and a group of my friends and neighbours did a tech course on beef-cattle management. It was more about getting out, having a chat and socialising once a week and getting away from the daily grind that the drought brings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have some problems that we need to deal with that are coming up, and they are particularly difficult problems. One is the shortage of grain. That can be largely overcome, and it is at the moment, with grain coming around from Western Australia. We are already seeing that. There have been half a dozen ships, thanks to the Western Australians. It looks like they're looking for another harvest this year, which will be a big help. Hay is a bit more difficult, because hay, per tonne, is more expensive to cart. To cart it long distances is difficult. Hay is getting in very short supply. A lot of charities have snaffled up hay, which is well and good, but it has also created a shortage for the people who are funding their own way, who have prepared for this drought and who have money put aside for this drought. They are now really having difficulties in sourcing hay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for New England mentioned the Great Artesian Basin and the further flow for the GABSI, the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative, which is a very important initiative. Where that initiative has been rolled out, those graziers have managed to last longer into the drought because they've been able to manage their pasture better because they've got water reticulated water across their properties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that was mentioned on the weekend with the announcement was the money to local governments. Eighteen local government areas will get funds; and the unincorporated area in western New South Wales, which doesn't have a local government, will get funds. That will be very, very important to create employment for those people who may not be getting employment because of the drought but who would be expecting to get upcoming work with a harvest, fencing or rural work like that. With supplies being purchased in those local communities, it would be a stimulus to the towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're on that, I've got to pay tribute to our cousins who live in towns and cities for their great interest and support. It has been overwhelming. The country people are overwhelmed by your support, but there are a couple of other things you can do to help. I know you can send things, if you want to send a food parcel, but that can have a negative effect for the local supermarket. If you want to help, send some cash. Give cash to one of the telethons or one of the reputable non-government organisations that are managing this. They know where that money will go and they'll spend it locally, in those local shops. But, if you want to do a more fun thing to help regional communities, go and have a long weekend in a country town. Go to Brewarrina and have a look at the oldest man-made structure on earthâ€”the fish traps. Visit the local community. Go to Bourke and visit the outback centre. Go up to Moree and swim in the hot pools. Go to Dubbo and visit the zoo. There are a whole range of things across my electorate that are very worthwhile. Those dollars that you would spendâ€”at the local pub; on having dinner; at the motel; on getting petrol at the local service stationâ€”would be very, very much appreciated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is the accelerated depreciation for hay and grain storage, fencing and water. That was announced in the first iteration of the white paper, with an accelerated depreciation of three years. A number of people have come to me and said: 'Because of that tax advantage, I have silos full of grainâ€”or I did, at the start of this drought. I've managed to put in water systems so that I'm not relying on dams that go dry. I've been able to fence up my property so that I'm managing pasture better. And I'm not destroying my property because of overstocking in certain areas during the drought.' That has been very, very welcome. And these announcements made on the weekend to bring that back to one year will be very, very welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to make another comment, and this is coming to me from a lot of my farmers. They are very appreciative of the support. They're very appreciative of the attention. But there is a bit of a concern that they are being portrayed as somehow helpless, as not in control of their own destiny, and as having got into this situation because of their own actions. Admittedly, someâ€”and some of those have actually become, somewhat, media starsâ€”may not be the best farmers and the most prepared, and quite often they are the ones that get attention. But I want to talk about the vast majority of farmers in Australia, and particularly those in my electorate, who are resilient, who are professional managers and who do know what they're doing. Most of them are just getting on with it. They are a little concerned that their industry is being devalued not only in the eyes of the rest of Australia but also in the eyes of those in the export market who might worry that Australia won't be able to meet its commitments to them. So we just need to keep in mind that these are mostly professional, well-run organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been listening to some of the comments and the amendment from the other side, and, quite frankly, they are incredibly patronising. I was hereâ€”I think it was in 2009â€”when the then ag minister, the member for Watson, removed the word 'drought' from government policy. The member for Forrest would remember that day very clearly. I certainly remember sitting here on that day. They said: 'We're no longer going to talk about "drought". We're replacing that with "dryness". We're going to remove all drought policy. We're going to put in a trial'â€”I think it was in Western Australia, with a few dollars attached to itâ€”'to help farmers adapt to climate change.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I've got to say: it's becoming very clear that climate change is real. There could probably be a debate on what can be done to abate it. But the idea that farmers aren't adapting to this changing climate is a nonsense. If the farmers today were farming like their fathers and mothers or grandparents, they wouldn't be there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evolution in agricultureâ€”with zero-till farming, and with the GM cotton crops that are growing more kilograms of produce with less diesel and less water than anywhere else in the worldâ€”is because of the innovation of farmers. Every drop of rain that falls on a farm now is utilised to fill up the profile of soil, to enable farmers to grow a crop. And the few crops that we do have about this year have been grown on stored moisture because of the management of those farmers. Livestock farmers now are managing their pasture in such a way that there is no run-off until their profile is full. They have fenced their properties so that they are managing these pastures properly. Not only that, but there is the breeding that is going into their livestock, with the gene technology identifying certain traits in genes of livestock and breeding for those traits. The irony of this is that, when the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> ran a story about a farmer shooting 1,200 sheep, lambs at Forbes made $300. And that is because of the management and the advancement of the farmers of today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been listening to some of the contributions from the other side. I've never heard so much patronising clap-trap in my life. I'm not going to talk to the member for Eden-Monaro about shooting people in a war zone or whatever with his background. I might have phrased that wrongly, but there's his military background.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  I withdraw that. What I will say is that I'm not going to talk to the member for Eden-Monaro about matters military, which he knows aboutâ€”I do withdraw what I saidâ€”but I will not sit here and listen to one of his patronising speeches, telling my farmers that they need to somehow have a program delivered from that side of parliament to adapt to climate change, because they damn well know what they're doing. They'll get through this and Australia will continue to lead the way in production and will continue to lead the way in agriculture. These changes to the household support that we're debating tonight will help them get through that particularly difficult time.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to speak on the extension of the government support through the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018. It will actually help the farmers who are so affected by drought in New South Wales. Increasing the farm asset threshold is important, as is the lump sum payment of $6,000 per couple. That is really, really important. I'm one of the few farmers in this place. I'm a dairy farmer from Western Australia. In Western Australia, we don't have the same conditions that are being experienced by farmers in New South Wales, but I well understand what it means to sit around the table. I know exactly what would be going on in the kitchens and how difficult it would be. You walk outside and all you see is dust. You look at the sheep or the cattle and all you want to do is feed them and keep them alive. You want to be able to access water as well to keep them alive. I consider what this has done, with the stress that's been added to the farmers and their families. Farms in Australia, and particularly in New South Wales, like much of my state, are family owned and run businesses. The family will sit around the kitchen table and they have to deal with the basics of life. There is no income and they walk outside and see it's out of their control. There is a huge level of stress involved in unplanned and unmanaged change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a farmer, I know that the one thing we can't control, no matter how much we do and how good we are at what we do, is the weather, and that's the issue for the farmers in New South Wales. The other thing that I know only too well is that, when it does rainâ€”and there will be people celebrating, as they should, when it rainsâ€”it's actually just the beginning. The grass doesn't appear overnight, so the ongoing support that the government is providing is so important to each of those families for the period of time it takes. Even after the rain has actually come, it takes time for the pastures to grow sufficiently for the cattle and the sheep to be able to graze at all. That doesn't happen overnight. How long it takes to get them back onto the grass depends on the actual number of animals that you have on your property. That is what I know will be happening in each of the homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly pleased to see increased support through the Rural Financial Counselling Service. They do an amazing job. They support these families in so many simple ways. I encourage every family out there: please access and use this service. At this time, you actually need these supports and services. Please take the supports that are there. I'm very pleased to see the feed that is being donated from Western Australia, mostly out of the member for O'Connor's electorate. I see the road trains. Apparently, around 20 road trains have donated hay from WA. Two thousand large square bales were in many ways delivered by the Rapid Relief Team, but often the truck drivers donate their time. They donate their time to bring the feed across to the farmers in New South Wales. I know that the farmers will be extremely grateful to receive every truckload of feed that arrives in New South Wales.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I want to tell two stories of belonging. I was at the station the other day with a friend of mine, Durga Owenâ€”same last name, no relationâ€”who's running for the state seat of Seven Hills. Durga is a Tamil woman and has that wonderful brown skin that I tried to get when I was young and instead got melanomas. She's a gorgeous woman. These two young Sudanese Australian boys walked past and then came back to talk to Durga. They said to her, 'We came back because we've never seen a dark-skinned woman on a poster in Australia.' For these two boys, this was the first time that they had seen those kinds of opportunities for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the same-sex marriage debate was going on, I interviewed a lot of people in my office. I opened my doors for about two weeks. There was a Christian couple who, part way through our meeting, said with some despair in their voices: 'We are a white, heterosexual, Christian couple. Where is our place in the world if this bill goes through?' There was a couple who was afraid of losing their place in the world, compared to the two Sudanese boys who were looking for oneâ€”two stories of belonging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that fascinating human community with all our hopes and fears, unfortunately, we see the fear mongersâ€”the people who seek to use fear and division for their own ends, people who see discomfort and uncertainty and fan it into fear to gain political power. In doing so, they damage both groups: those who are looking for a place in the world and those who are trying to hold onto it. Both groups deserve the respect and understanding of our community, and neither group should be exploited for political gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share an email I received from a member of my community following the inflammatory speech by Senator Anning. It was addressed to me and my state counterpart. The gentleman, whose name I won't share with you, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've rarely had the courage to say more than a few words to you in person but I'd like to say thank you for your contributions. I'm writing because I am getting worried about the rise of the extreme right parties in Australia. I am concerned about the increasing use of the nazi vocabulary. The casual racism that came from the mouths of people getting on the train at Clyde on the weekend, well dressed, implying that they had been enjoying the races â€¦ The Nazi-imitating groups plastering their stickers around Sydney. I hope the toxic press and the political point scoring that is happening around Victoria (as well from federal parliament) regarding people of African background does not show up here in Parramatta, when your respective elections come around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say that he is filled with dread about what may happen in Australia over the next five to 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week's hate-fuelled comments by Senator Anning in his first speech were reprehensible. I, like the majority of our federal parliamentarians, was appalled by what Senator Anning said. Australia has had a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy since 1973, to the benefit of us all. I add my voice to the recommitment to an immigration policy that does not discriminate due to race, faith or ethnic origin. We are a nation built on migration. At Federation, in 1901, one in four people was born overseas and it's around that now. As Bill Shorten said last week:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the simple truth is this: we are a stronger, better country because of all those who've come across the seas and joined their story to ours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate have been raising this issue with me and raising their concerns that the fear politics of racial division, trussed up as law and order policy, will flow into our community in the lead-up to the next federal election. The corrosive debates about Sudanese gang related violence and misconstrued typecasting of Muslim members of our communityâ€”the debates that we have seen in Victoriaâ€”will spread to our community, and members of my electorate are genuinely concerned that real damage will be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are better than this. Our community is successful because of its very natureâ€”its vibrancy and its multicultural roots. In Parramatta, 99,444 people were born overseas. That's 53.4 per cent. Their country of birth may not have been Australia, but their country of choice is. We are Australians. We speak English, Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi, Korean or one of the many other languages of the world but we are one people. If we stick together, if we support each other, we will be stronger together. My community rocks.</span>

                  <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  It's time to talk about energy policy in a way that makes sense and that is factual. We can have different ideas in this House, the people's House; it's hard to have different facts and facts speak for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to energy, these are the facts. During six years of the previous Labor government, electricity prices doubled and went up each and every year. Fact: Labor federal and state policies have continued to increase pressure on prices. Fact: in my state of Queensland, where generation is responsible for some 30 per cent of power prices and distribution for 50 per cent of power prices, 80 per cent of the power prices are set by the Labor state government, by regulation, to ensure that a return of up to six per cent goes back to the Crown. Eighty per cent of the price of your power bill is set by the Labor state government through regulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fact: job-destroying gas bans and moratoriums in New South Wales and Victoria, unrealistic renewable energy targets of up to 50 per cent and open hostility to dispatchable power from gas and coal are driving up power prices. Fact: our record has been to fix this mess. We've turned the corner on power prices now, with reductions announced in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia from 1 July this year. We've done this by requiring power companies to provide better deals for millions of customers, by securing priority gas supply for Australians before exporting overseas and by stopping the energy networks from gaming the system which, if undertaken by Labor, would have cost consumers $6.5 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fact: we are investing in national infrastructure like Snowy Mountains 2.0. We're taking further action; we're not content to sit back on our laurels. We're fast-tracking recommendations made by the ACCC to boost competition in the energy sector. We're supporting the financing of projects that will see new generation assets built for large commercial and industrial customers. The ACCC and the regulator will begin work on calculating a default price. The savings for residential customers moving to the new default offer will range from somewhere between $183 to $416. For the average small to medium-sized business, the savings could range between $567 and almost $1,500.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer has directed the ACCC, with the regulator, to commence comprehensive electricity price monitoring into the prices, profits and margins in the supply of electricity in the National Electricity Market. This is actionâ€”serious action. The ACCC will prepare ongoing reports, identifying cases where outcomes are unacceptable. If the businesses fail to rectify the issues, the ACCC will be able to recommend a proportional and targeted response for the Treasurer's determination. This could include enforceable undertakings, fines and divestment as a last resort. This is action. This is what it looks like to ensure our energy prices are the cheapest they could possibly be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will create more reliability in the system, with new requirements for more dispatchable power, including coal, gas and hydro, which will lower prices and stop blackouts. The government is not in a position to take an emissions component forward because it's already there. We have voluntary targets that we will meet. There is no requirement to enshrine emission components anywhere on a legislative basis and we won't do it. There is no reason why providers cannot start building a new coal-fired power station in Queensland right now. If it stacks up for them price-wise, I would encourage them to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">History has shown that the Labor Party is the party of blackouts and higher electricity prices through, in the words of the Business Council of Australia, their 'economic wrecking' 45 per cent emissions reduction target and their 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target. Labor wants more subsidies, higher prices and greater unreliability; it will lead to less employment. Under Labor's emissions intensity scheme, households would pay an average $300 more on their power bills compared to under the coalition, where savings would be upwards of $400.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's true thinking was revealed by the Labor Environment Action Network, which said that high prices are not a market failure, they are proof of the market working well. I say to the Australian people: high prices are proof of Labor meddling in the energy markets, where we need the market to operate effectively and seamlessly. We need it to operate in a way that makes prices the cheapest they possibly can be, or, in the words and the recommendations of the ACCC, 'We will step in to protect consumers'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise today to urge the government to support the Home Stretch initiative. Home Stretch calls for the voluntary continuation of out-of-home care for 18- to 21-year-olds and is championed by Anglicare Victoria and supported by a wide range of social service organisations. Out-of-home care is provided to young people who are unable to live with their parents and ends when a young person turns just 18. Young people in foster care or alternative care are vulnerable. They often have backgrounds of abuse or neglect and need additional care and support to fulfil their potential and to avoid poor social and economic decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prevention, as they say, is far better than cure, and providing additional resources during the early years of adulthood is the critical period of transition. It would not only improve outcomes for individuals but also provide a long-term benefit to the federal budget. According to Home Stretch, in the first year out of state guardianship 35 per cent of young people have resided in five or more locationsâ€”that's just in the first year. Twenty-nine per cent are unemployed, compared to the national unemployment rate for young people of around 12 per cent, and 28 per cent are already parents. Sixty-eight per cent are involved in juvenile justice and 40 per cent experience homelessness. These are grim statistics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similar programs in comparable jurisdictions that extend out-of-home care to the age of 21 have been met with economic and social success. For example, the United Kingdom's Staying Put program is a voluntary opt-in program that allows a young person to make an agreement with their foster carer to remain living with them until they are 21 years of age. An evaluation of the pilot found that 55 per cent of themâ€”more than halfâ€”were enrolled in full-time education, compared to just 22 per cent of those who had exited care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the United States, the federal government is in partnership with a number of states to provide support for young people up to age 21 who are in foster care or out-of-home-care situations. In California, such support is on the condition that the young person is either attending high school, enrolled in college or vocational education, employed for at least 80 hours a month or participating in a program aimed at gaining employment. A study of the program in San Bernardino, California, found that 66 per cent of the participants completed the US year 12 equivalent and half were involved in college or vocational education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Home Stretch initiative engaged Deloitte Access Economics to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of its proposal for voluntary continuation of out-of-home care for those aged 18 to 21. Deloitte concluded that the program's national average cost-benefit ratio was two to 13, which means that for every single dollar invested $2.13 is returned to the community, to taxpayers. Modelling shows that if implemented it would halve homelessness for this cohort from 39 per cent to 19 per cent, reduce interaction with the criminal justice system, reduce hospitalisation rates and reduce alcohol and drug dependence. For drug dependence, they believe it would go down from around 15 per cent to 2.5 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this program, if properly implemented, would reduce teen pregnancy and stem the cyclical nature of intergenerational poverty and involvement with child protection services. To respond to a third of the care leavers nationally and realise the program's outcome, the total cost of the program would be around $30 million per annum, with benefits to the community of more than $60 million. I commend the new South Australian Minister for Child Protection, Rachel Sanderson MP, who has announced that children in foster care could be supported by the government until age 21. It does not, at this point, extend to children who are in alternative care, but only to those in foster care. But it is a good start. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I seek leave to table <span style="font-style:italic;">Raising our children: Guiding young Victorians in care into adulthood: Socioeconomic Cost Benefit Analysis</span>, published by Anglicare Victoria and put together by Deloitte Access Economics. I believe this is a good spend, a logical spend, for our community and our nation. What we need though is a good evidence base. I seek leave to table this document.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241586" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  When we come to this parliament, we come with the intention of making a difference. In many instances I've had a terrific list of achievements such as Triple Care Farm's youth ice detox facility, over $240 million for road upgrades in Gilmore, over $500 million invested in HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span> for the base redevelopment, new facilities for the Seahawk and Romeo helicopters and the training facilities for Navy and Army helicopter crews. I've delivered $155 million for the new Nowra bridge and four intersections. In 2017 we announced $13.8 million for the Far North Collector Road as a vital first step in this project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs growth in Australia has had the best year on record, increasing for the 17th straight monthâ€”the longest run ever of jobs growth. It's reflected in our local area. Overall unemployment in Gilmore was sitting at 8.9 per cent when I came into the job as the local member. It's now at 7.7 per cent, and local youth unemployment has almost halved. The South Coast regional jobs investment package will create up to 1,000 jobs in our region, from Berry to Moruya. In 2017 the Gilmore apprenticeship drive saw over 1,300 participants gain an apprenticeship. Our new Local Employment Initiative Fund will directly support employment projects in the area such as mentoring programs and the upskilling of people looking for work so that they're job ready. Our new employment facilitator in Gilmore and our Incubator Support Initiative will also support our local residents to find jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all Gilmore-specific but I'm also part of a government that has a long-term view for improving the quality of life for all Australians. More than a million jobs have been created since the Liberal-National government was elected in 2013. More Australians than ever before have full-time jobs. Full-time employment has risen by a robust 3.2 per cent over the year, nearly three times the decade average rate of 1.1 per cent. We're providing an additional $2.4 million a year for national disability advocacy programs in New South Wales and Queensland. We've also guaranteed that children with autism will continue to receive intensive support through specialised learning centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our tax relief for middle- and low-income earners will greatly benefit our local and whole Australian economy. In 2018-19 over 10 million Australians will get tax relief, with 4.4 million Australians receiving the full $530 benefit. Ninety-four per cent of Australian workers will not face a higher marginal tax rate of more than 32Â½c in the dollar, with low- and middle-income earners our first priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're increasing the pension work bonus. People can get an extra $50, which takes the bonus up to $300 a fortnight. We're expanding the Pension Loans Scheme to boost their income. We're delivering record investment in schoolsâ€”an average of 50 per cent more funding per student over a decade. A new childcare package will provide more support for more than 5,000 families in Gilmore. There are record levels of hospital funding, with a new agreement to deliver a 30 per cent increase over five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the more you work for resolutions for different groups, the more general and complex the cases become. As a local example, Michael Dignam and Liz Lewis, who run the Milk and Honey Cafe in Kiama, may face the prospect of losing their business after issues surrounding the extension of their lease and their lodgement of an expression of interest application. This cafe is well known and popular in Kiama, and we should be doing everything in our power to help. Sadly, it's a battle that lies with the state government, Crown Lands and local government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is changing the way subcontractors are paid when tier 1 contractors, like Lendlease, refuse to make good on their debt responsibilities. Mark Nelson was subcontracted by Hewatt's Construction, and Hewatt's was subcontracting for Lendlease to work at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>. Lendlease, I believe, did not show proper due diligence. Hewatt's were paid but went into administration. There are frustrations in the process, and these are outlined in the investigative material that I supplied to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, and more immediately, there is the issue that I and many in my electorate consider a crisis facing our dairy farmers. Recently I wrote to the CEOs of Coles, IGA, Aldi and Woolworths, requesting that they consider increasing the amount they pay to farmersâ€”just 20c a litre, 20c a dozen and 20c a kilogram for produce to help our farmers. For the last eight years the price of milk has been fixed at $1 a litre. It's pathetic that nothing else on our shelves has remained constant during this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017 it was reported that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC found the dairy pricing system to be outdated and skewed in favour of the â€¦ processors, with farmers enjoying no real bargaining power and limited scope to rearrange their businesses and milk contracts to either accurately predict their current incomes or improve their selling options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our local farmers in Gilmore want to have the ability to futureproof themselves, to build their own resilience and to be able to look after themselves. There is more we can do, and that's why I'll continue to fight for them and their families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Last Saturday I was privileged to host a forum at The Murri School in Acacia Ridge, a special private school in my electorate of Moreton. Senator Patrick Dodson and Queensland state minister Leeanne Enoch joined me for a discussion with leaders and members of the Indigenous community, along with leaders of my multicultural community. I particularly acknowledge Uncle Des, Uncle Bob, Aunty Alex, Kim and Victor, Lewis Lee and Surendra Prasadâ€”Lewis Lee is from the Chinese community and Surendra Prasad is from the Indian community. I'd like to particularly thank the Murri School for allowing us to use their school for this special event. It was a fitting venue to hold this important dialogue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was the dialogue? It was held because the Aboriginal and Islander Independent Community School, known as 'The Murri School', has a special place in the heart of the south side of Brisbane. It was established in 1986 'to promote the development of Indigenous students as independent and skilled people who are culturally, morally and socially responsible, employable, capable of self-fulfilment and of contributing to society'. The school has given Indigenous families a real choice of education for their children. This choice contributes to real self-determination in educational outcomes for students and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the discussion on Saturday was also about self-determination. It was about the start of a conversation with local community leaders about the path to constitutional recognition in the wake of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. I was very proud to be a part of this special and important event in Moreton. For far too long our First Nations peoples have been left out of this nation's conversation. They're not even on our birth certificate, despite building and actually owning the hospital. For far too long white Anglo-Saxon men especially have made laws without any consultation or even consideration about how those laws will impact on First Nations people. For far too long we have been blind to the learnings of 60,000 years of caring for country by our First Nations peoples. In Moreton, we started the conversation to learn from 60,000 years of lessonsâ€”3,000 generations of passing down knowledge. Moreton is the most multicultural electorate in Queensland, so it is important to include our multicultural leaders in this conversation. We can all learn together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Patrick Dodson, as co-chair of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition Relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples was able to speak about the interim report that his committee has recently tabled. Senator Dodson shared the work the committee has achieved so far and the work that is still to be done before the inquiry is complete. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland minister, Leeanne Enochâ€”the first female Murri minister in Queenslandâ€”shares some of my electorate. Leeanne has a special connection with the Indigenous community, so I was particularly pleased she could help host this forum. Minister Enoch said: 'The event occurred at a time when Australia finds itself at a crossroads once again regarding the future direction of First Nations relationships. Comments like those put forward by'â€”and I will say his nameâ€”'Senator Anning last week once again created a platform of division in this country. The discussion regarding constitutional reform, truth-telling and agreement-makingâ€”or treatyâ€”are critical at this time in our history. It is through our progression towards an honest, faithful understanding of our past and a respectful, dedicated agreement for the future that extremist views shared in our parliaments would be held to account. This conversation enabled us to take an important first step towards understanding the most powerful path forward.' </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my hope that this forum held in Moreton is just the beginning, that Moreton can help lead the discussion, that we can work together, bringing all members of the community on this journey with us. I feel deeply that we have a lot to learn from our First Nations peoples, especially in their understanding of caring for this country, the only country that we have. For 60,000 years, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community have looked after and cared for the land to which we all belong. It has, sadly, copped a bit of a hiding over the last 225 years or so, but it is still the only country to which we belong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote a paper with Senator Dodson recently that touched on this very issue. The paper noted that our Constitution contains a long list of responsibilities of the Commonwealth government, as written by white men back in the late 1890s, but caring for country is not one of them. The sense of duty of our First Nations peoples to care for country has continued, notwithstanding the colonial and federal shenanigans that have gone on around them. A whole-of-country problem needs a whole-of-country solution. We can learn so much from the example long set by our First Nations peoples. We have so much to learn.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  It's always a pleasure to rise in this House and speak about our great electorates. Every single day, I reflect on the trust that has been placed on me by the electors of my community of Forde. I humbly acknowledge that trust. I know they trust me not to be distracted by the political push and shove that occurs in the cocoon of Canberra and that occurs on all sides of politics from time to time. Importantly, they want me to remain focused on the issues that concern them. I want to say to the people in my community of Forde that I am and always will be focused on working tirelessly on their behalf as a member of this government. We're getting on with the job of delivering a better Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Forde are hardworking, honest people who care about their families and their futures. They care about being safe and secure from threats, both locally and in Australia at large, which is why the coalition has secured our borders. We've stopped the boats. We've cancelled the visas of thousands of foreign nationals who have committed serious crimes. We will continue to defend Australian values and protect our way of life. We've also invested locally some $525,000 through our Safer Communities Fund for CCTV cameras in Bethania, Loganholme and Marsden State High School, as well as a mobile safety camera vehicle for Logan City Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Forde want to keep more of their hard-earned cash, and I'm proud to say that some 74,000 taxpayers in the community of Forde will benefit from the low- to middle-income tax relief of up to $530 in the 2018-19 financial year. Importantly, we want people to have the dignity and self-respect that comes with having a job. The coalition government has seen the delivery of over a million jobs in our economy since we were elected. We are doing this by backing small business through our small- to medium-business tax cuts, which have helped some 15Â½ thousand of my local businesses invest, employ and pay their workers more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Forde care about getting a bed in a good hospital if one of their family members gets sick. This is why the federal government has locked in a 34 per cent funding increase to public hospitals over the next five years in the Brisbane south metro region. This is on top of the money that has been poured into the Logan Hospital and the Gold Coast University Hospital, both totalling over $1 billion over the last three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate care about their kids getting a good education. This government has focused on delivering that for the people of Forde. An extra $3.4 billion will go into schools in the electorate of Forde over the next 10 years to ensure they have the resources and capacity to ensure a bright future for our kids. Additionally, the people in my electorate of Forde want affordable child care. As of 2 July, some 8,900 local families in Forde have already started benefitting from our childcare reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the people of Forde care about not sitting in endless traffic jams on the way to and from work each day. I've fought hard for the electorate of Forde over the last seven years to the extent that I've managed to secure $1.3 billion to upgrade the M1. I also want to acknowledge the hard work of my Gold Coast colleagues Karen Andrews, Steven Ciobo, Stuart Robert and Ross Vasta in the support for those M1 upgrades. I want to acknowledge, really, the whole of team Queensland; we've all worked together to achieve these for our communities. The M1, and particularly the M1/Gateway merge and the stretch from Eight Mile Plains to Loganlea Road, is an issue that I know is close to the heart of my constituents, and I'm proud that I turned the first sod on this vital upgrade a month or so ago with my good colleague Karen Andrews, the member for McPherson. As this work is completed, it will see our families get home faster and sooner. People will be able to spend more time with their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for a reality check, to take a breath and to remember the coalition government is delivering on its commitments to live within its means, create a stronger economy for more jobs, keep our borders safe, guarantee essential services and encourage and reward hardworking Australians. It's with great pride that I am the member for Forde. I remain committed to and focused on representing the great people of my electorate in this House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263070" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  At a time when politics has been consumed by speculation about leadership, Australians want their government to act in their best interests, and, in particular, to think about the long-term consequences of policy. This government has failed to protect Australian jobs and the Australian coastal shipping industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bass has an overrepresentation of seafarers and master mariners given that it hosts Australia's pre-eminent maritime educational institution, the Australian Maritime College. There has been a constant loss of Australian shipping jobs, which has been accelerated under the Abbott and Turnbull governments. This government is prepared to wave goodbye to highly skilled, highly paid jobs, particularly jobs that benefit the regions within Australia, in order to support marginal cost reductions for large corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely extraordinary to my mind that Australia does not adopt any formal system of cabotage, such as is adopted for strategic reasons in many nations with significant coastlines. India and the United States are good examples. I fail to understand why the interests of a shipping company, usually overseas owned, is preferred to the interests of well-paid, highly trained Australian workers. In the name of cost cutting, Australian flag vessels, which are Australian crewed, end up coming back to Australia under a flag of convenience, with foreign, low-paid, exploited workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many strategic interests in maintaining a strong maritime tradition, with a strong, well-trained and well-paid Australian workforce. Significant concern has been expressed across the political divide as to Australia's ability to store and transport strategic freight, including fuel, oil and other petroleum products, in the event of conflict or other disruption. Our domestic shipping capability has been eroded, either intentionally or without proper care, to such an extent that we can no longer rely upon Australian flag vessels and/or Australian crew to perform the strategic function of transporting vital energy supplies to our major cities or to our defence forces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that our maritime workforce is relatively high paid, therefore increasing costs to our domestic shippers, ignores the fact that in some cases, particularly road freight, there are hidden or implied subsidies that distort cost comparisons between road freight and shipping or rail. Some years ago it was estimated that the implied subsidy for road freight between Melbourne and Brisbane, taking into account infrastructure spend on roads, was many hundreds of millions of dollars. Any economic analysis seeking to address the comparable cost of shipping to road or rail freight would need to take into account all of the inputs and outputs to undertake a proper cost-benefit analysis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, either through benign neglect or ideological reasons, has hastened the decline of the Australian coastal shipping industry. Every Australian should support proper labour market testing for Australian seafaring jobs. Shipping companies should not reflag their vessels under flags of convenience in order to lower their marginal costs. This process will only hasten the decline of our maritime industry, an industry that should be supported.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I have had some very special guests in Canberra today. Their names are Indigo and Ginger. They're puppies, but they're not just any puppies; they're Vision Australia seeing eye dog puppies. Indigo and Ginger have been here with me all day to highlight the role seeing eye dogs play in assisting people who are blind or who have low vision. For the people who rely on them, seeing eye dogs make it possible to have a life of independence, mobility and opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vision Australia's Victorian head office is located in Higgins, so I have been very fortunate to see their incredible work firsthand. Across Australia they provide support to more than 27,500 people of all ages each year. And I'm privileged to be hosting Vision Australia in parliament today, including board member Cameron Roles, with Cooper, and government relations manager Chris Edwards, with Odie, as well as CEO Ron Hooten and Kate Begley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's inspiring to witness these dogs at work. They help people like Cameron and Chris navigate the world with confidence. Seeing eye dogs enable people to catch public transport, get to and from work, navigate shopping centres and participate with confidence in everyday life. Each seeing eye dog takes an enormous responsibility to keep their partner safe. It takes between 14 and 18 months to train a dog. This starts at just eight weeks of age. Only around 35 of these dogs graduate each year. In the first 18 months of its life, a seeing eye dog lives with a volunteer puppy carer. While it can be hard work, it is also extremely rewarding and certainly changes lives for the better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past few months, more than 100 puppies have been born at Seeing Eye Dogs. This means there is a great need for more puppy carers. As a volunteer puppy carer, you play a formative role in the development of a seeing eye dog. Puppy development trainers frequently visit new carers to provide support and advice, which is what Lester and Brittany have been doing for me today as I have been a puppy carer for 24 hours. I urge anyone who thinks that they could support a seeing eye dog in training to contact Vision Australia on 1300847466. But, if you're unable to care for a puppy, there is still something that you can do. You can help one be trained. You can make a donation. It costs around $50,000 for one seeing eye dog to graduate, so every single dollar counts. I want to thank Vision Australia for the incredible work that they do to help fellow Australians who so vitally need their work, support and care. Long may it continue. I'm totally privileged to host you today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I rise today to speak about the parlous state of support for early childhood education and specifically for the Universal Access to Early Childhood Education program under this Commonwealth government. As you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, kindy is so important for four-year-olds. It's so important that four-year-olds have access to great-quality early education, and yet this governmentâ€”it has been revealed in Early Learning Matters Weekâ€”has a $440 million cut in store for kindergarten programs in this country once the agreement ends in 2020. In fact, it was made clear by this government that it has only extended the funding for kindergartens to the end of 2019. It's now been made clear that the agreement itself is expiring at the end of June 2020. The budget papers themselves make clear this $440 million cut to kindy programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited a number of kindies in my electorate recently, including at West End, Bulimba, Carina, Cannon Hill and a range of other places. I was on the kindy committee at Cannon Hill kindy only a few years ago, when my daughter was a kindy kid, and my husband was then, two years later, on the committee as well. We saw firsthand the importance that kindy has in kids' lives. We saw firsthand the significance of this amazing program. It is really important, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that kids be prepared for school. As you'd expect from the time frames I gave you earlier, my kids are now at school. My little one is in grade 1, and my older child is in grade 3. They were so well prepared for school because of the amazing education that they got as four-year-olds at the Lady Gowrie down at Cannon Hill. I want every other child to have the same opportunity that my kids had to get a wonderful early start in life through amazing educators at a kindy program, whether that's at a community kindy, long day care or some other form of the kindy program, like eKindy. eKindy came to visit me recentlyâ€”they might have visited you tooâ€”to talk about the work that they do to provide kindy programs for kids in rural and remote areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor really understands the importance of kindy, and that's why, when we were last in government, we put together the universal access agreement. Since that agreement was signed, there has been a marked increase in the proportion of Australian kids who are enrolling in preschool and kindyâ€”it's called preschool in some states and kindy in others. We've actually seen that head up north of 93 per cent of enrolments for Australian kids into the kindy program. That is a great achievement, which is why it was so disappointing, on the first day of Early Learning Matters Week, to see the confirmation in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian Financial Review </span>that the government will be cutting their funding to the universal access program. The Liberals had signalled their intention in the May budget, which only provided for funding for next year, as I said. I keep thinking they're going to extend it by five years. We now know there is no intention to fund the universal access program beyond the end of 2020. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  It was an absolute pleasure on Saturday night to attend the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Australia annual gala dinner, 'Reach for the stars', joining local Dunkley residents, Georgia, Stewart and Ally from Seaford, as well as Ally's friend Lily, along with Jason Wood MP, Spinal Muscular Atrophy Australia members and many others to support those who are living with spinal muscular atrophy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Minister for Health announced that Spinraza, a key treatment for SMA, which is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder, would be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme after much advocacy from me, many other members of parliament and those outside of parliament. From 1 June this year, we made Spinraza available on the PBS for the treatment of types 1, 2 and 3a SMA for all patients under the age of 18. We were able to do this by managing the economy well, meaning we could list these drugs on the PBS. We continue to advocate to get this listed for adults as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This medicine works by slowing the progression of the disease and, in many cases, the drug can halt the progression of the disease. For others, it can significantly improve motor function. It is expected around 160 patients will receive treatment every year as a result of this listing. Without being added to the PBS, patients would otherwise pay over $367,000 a year for this medicine. The PBS listing has instead reduced the cost for patients to a maximum of $39.50 per script for general patients and $6.40 for concessional patients. I've spoken to countless families in my electorate and elsewhere about the need for this vital medicine, and I know what a positive difference it will now make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To personally hear from the families who have directly benefited from the Turnbull coalition government's actions to provide additions to the PBS, and to see firsthand the impact on so many people's lives, has been both an encouraging and a humbling experience. This addition to the PBS delivers hope for so many incredible young patients and their families. Since coming into government, the coalition has helped improve the health of Australians by subsidising more than $8.3 billion worth of new medicines. We are now subsidising all drugs recommended by the PBAC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to the PBS is rock solid and, together with Medicare, it is a foundation of our world-class healthcare system here in Australia. I am proud of our government's actions and the responsible management of the economy, which means that lives can be changed in such an impacting way. I will continue to advocate for people with spinal muscular atrophy, both below the age of 18 and those above, both now and into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  What's said in this place matters. We saw that last week, and we continue to feel it in the community, particularly in those communities that I represent. I'm so very proud to represent a diverse, multicultural electorate in Melbourne's northern suburbs, an electorate in which more than 70,000 people were born overseas and a considerably greater number speak a language other than English at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Scullin is, in microcosm, modern Australia and, in one respect, I share the aspiration and the pride of the Prime Minister, the member for Wentworthâ€”he appeared to be a Prime Minister last time I checkedâ€”when he talks about the multiculturalism of Australia being one of our greatest successes. This is fine, as far as it goes. It must go further, because the rhetorical position of the Prime Minister, and too many members of this government, sit uncomfortably with some of the rhetoric government ministers have been using. I refer in particular to the description and the awful references to African gangs which have licensed bigotry in my town. I think about other attacks under this government on multiculturalism, in particular, the continued attempts to deny citizenship to people for a whole range of entirely irrelevant reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also reflect on questions of faith, as someone who is of no religious faith. In the Scullin electorate there are 13,000 Australian Muslims. They represent a resilient and generous community. I cherish my relationship, in particular, with the community around the Thomastown Mosque. It is appalling that they and so many of their friends around this country have been subject to so many outrageous attacks again in this place and in the other place, I should say, in particular. These Muslim Australians should never be made to feel as if they are anything less than equal. It's incumbent on all of us to stand up for them and their faith, a faith of peace, and to recognise the extraordinary contributions they are making to our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud to represent a very large number of our First Australians, who are increasingly prominent in Melbourne's northern suburbs. I hope that, should the member for Dickson be elevated, he will reflect on his appalling actions in 2009.</span>

                  </a>  It's past time that he apologises and sends a signal to our First Australians, because what we need from this government at every level is leadership. The statement and bipartisanship in the House of Representatives last week was important, but it must be a start. It was necessary but it is by no means sufficient. This parliament should be for all Australians. We've got to make it clear that modern Australia is a diverse and multicultural societyâ€”not a tolerant society but an inclusive one in which every Australian, regardless of their faith or background has every opportunity to fully participate. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

For decades the resources industry has powered Australia's economy. As a Western Australian born and raised in the Goldfields, I am always very proud of the contribution of the sector. Now as the member for Durack I represent the major mining communities of Western Australia, people who understand how important strong economic policy is to the future of their own community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The north-west of WA is renowned for the huge volume of iron ore shipped out of the Pilbara every year, but we're now seeing rapid growth in a number of other commodities, and the Turnbull government is supporting the development of these emerging commodities. That's why the coalition has approved a $19 million loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to boost lithium exports from the Pilbara. This loan will allow Pilbara Minerals Ltd to upgrade a 70-kilometre long public road to its Pilgangoora mine, one of the largest lithium ore deposits in the world. A new road will make transporting lithium safer and far more efficient by improving travel times from the mine to the port. Governments should be backing lithium. Australia has tripled production in recent years to become the world's largest exporter of the mineral. Global demand for the resource is growing, as lithium is critical to the production of batteries, phones and laptops. More importantly, if we are serious about changing the composition of our energy mix over time, lithium has a huge role to play. It's a cornerstone of energy storage, and increasing global demand reflects its importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lithium is not the only commodity that is in the headlines in my electorate. Further north in the Kimberley Sheffield Resources Ltd is progressing well and developing one of the largest mineral sand deposits discovered in the last 30 years. Sheffield's Thunderbird project, based near Derby, is set to enter production in 2020. Pending federal environmental approval, this mine will create nearly 300 jobs in the region and, importantly, continue to diversify Western Australia's mining sector. Thunderbird is rich in zircon, a mineral used to manufacture many products, such as ceramics and tiles. It's projects like those that deliver jobs and prosperity for the people of the Kimberley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to put on record that I commend Sheffield Resources for this fantastic project. I congratulate them for the progress they have made to date, for the development of this project and for giving great hope to the potential workforce, many of whom are Aboriginal and living in the Derby region, which is an area that is desperate for new jobs. Only the Turnbull government will create the investment certainty that these projects need in order to get off the ground. More importantly, it's allowing mining companies in my electorate to grow, thrive and create jobs for Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I'd like to tell you about Gary. I've known Gary for a long time. He's a good, down-to-earth bloke with a big heart. He has known his share of joy and sadness, and he is now one of Rural Aid's counsellors working with those on the land to offer support to those whose lives have been decimated by the drought we're currently in. Gary is not one for melodrama, yet he describes the situation on the land at the moment as being absolutely tragic and says the suicide rate is off the charts. Even if it rains tomorrow, he warns, it will take the land at least two years to recover from this massive dry. Even more frightening is his ominous observation that every Australian drought is broken by a flood. He has warned that, while the land will take two years to heal, the trauma and the psychological injuries suffered by our farmers and their families at this time will take far longer to overcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that much of our nation's food bowl is at the moment a dust bowl. We know that stock are dying in droves. We know that farms are crumbling. We know that, for many, hope has gone. This is where Gary and his employer, Rural Aid, come in. Last week I spoke in praise of the 9,000-resident community of Medowie, which raised $70,000 for Rural Aid. This charity has been doing incredible work in a multitude of drought relief related areasâ€”water, hay, food, counselling, farm visits, farm stays and even a farm army of volunteers who come in and do mechanical work, repairs, fencing or whatever needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All around us charities, members of our broader community, businesses and big corporations are digging deep to help our farmers, but what about us here in parliament? I think the Prime Minister needs to have a good hard look at his government's response to this dire situation. It galls me to hear the former agriculture minister, the member for New England, spouting from the back bench, 'What are we doing to help our farmers?' He had five years to help our farmers and he did nought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government has committed $12,000 in assistance. This shouldn't come in two payments; it should come as one lump sum, as we've suggested. Those farmers need that help now. The $1.8 billion support package announced to much fanfare on the weekend, unfortunately, doesn't stand up well to scrutiny. Opposition leader Bill Shorten has suggested that Prime Minister Turnbull draw on the $700 million it stands to reap in penalties accrued by the Commonwealth Bank. Wouldn't it be great to divert those funds to our farmers, many of whom have suffered greatly at the hands of our banks? More importantly, we need a government that's prepared to lead, not play the sorts of charades it has today.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  It's my great pleasure to report on job creation and unemployment levels on the Gold Coast, especially the northern Gold Coast, which gives an indication of what this government has achieved. Since September 2013 over one million jobs have been created across the country. It is quite extraordinary. My community on the Gold Coast has benefitted enormously from what the government has done in tackling unemployment. The policy settings and the programs for businesses to grow and employ are reaping results. The numbers tell a great story. The numbers don't lie. They are what they are. They are from the ABS. Regardless of your side of politics, the numbers are the numbers. We can have different views; we generally can't have different facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the northern Gold Coast in my seat of Fadden we have a labour force of 100,715 and, of those, 95,741 have a job. That's a fact. There are, unfortunately, 4,973 people unemployed, but that's an unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent. The national average is 5Â½ per cent, give or take. The unemployment rate is 4.9 per cent in my seat. As at June 2018 the mature age, 55 and over, unemployment rate was 1.9 per centâ€”98.1 per cent are employed. This has decreased by 1.9 per cent over the past year. The unemployment rate for those over 55 has halved in the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The youth unemployment rate nationally is 10 per cent, 11 per cent or 12 per cent. In my seat on the northern Gold Coast it has dropped by 2.9 per cent and is only 8.2 per cent. As at June this year there were five jobactive providers helping 5,652 people in their search for a job. Only 580 young people aged from 18 to 21 are jobseekers and there are 2,140 mature-age jobseekers. However you slice and dice full employment, with unemployment at 4.9 per cent and unemployment at 1.9 per cent for those aged 55 and over, the Gold Coast is doing exceptionally well. This is driven by the policies of this government, which is why I'm so proud to serve in this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Retail is the biggest employerâ€”42,045 people are involved in retail. Transition to Work is helping people aged 15 to 21 years improve their work readiness. We're clearly seeing the results flow. Since February 2016 this program has helped place young people in my electorate into 242 jobs. There are currently 119 young Gold Coasters in the program; 1,317 jobseekers have accessed work for the dole; and 50 businesses in my electorate have benefited from the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science's payments and 62 businesses have seen other benefits from that program. This government is delivering on employment for the Gold Coast.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I rise today to speak about an oversight from the Department of Human Services and the Department of Defence. I've recently been contacted by a constituent of mine, a member of the Australian Defence Force. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank them for their service to our nation and our country. My constituent had a Centrelink matter that they were finding very difficult to manage. As part of their service, my constituent had recently been deployed overseas. When they returned, they found that their Centrelink payments had stopped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I learnt that, if an ADF member is the beneficiary of the family tax benefit, childcare benefit or the childcare rebate, they are required to inform DHS of their deployment prior to their departure or risk losing their payments. For those who don't inform Centrelink prior, their benefit is completely lost after six weeks. This is ridiculous. These are people who are serving our nationâ€”people who have been deployed overseasâ€”and we should do better than this. It's astounding that a government has punitive measures in place for deployed service men and women who are serving our nation, who are there to protect our nation and who are putting themselves at risk every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In correspondence to me, the minister's officeâ€”after I informed themâ€”advised me of a web page that would perhaps be able to assist my constituent. I found the information available from this web page to be extremely unreasonable, as did my constituent. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ they must provide the Department of Human Services with a letter signed by their Commanding Officer on Department of Defence letterhead stating they are being deployed overseas and the period that they will be deployed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only problem is that no-one tells the members of our Defence Force that this is the case when they're being deployed overseas. So most of them go overseas and only find out when they come back and they get cut off from those childcare benefits or whatever benefit it is. The cherry on the top is that, if Australian Defence Force members want further information, amongst other resources, they're provided with the Families Centrelink number. Time and time again my colleagues and I have raised this issue in this Chamber and have pointed out that Centrelink is in crisis, with calls going unanswered and ballooning waiting times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of our Defence Force are being put through hell when they get back after serving our nation. This is the level of support available to ADF members to navigate their payment responsibilities, and it is appalling. The minister should be doing more and the government should be doing more for the people who serve us and protect us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  It's a great pleasure to report to the parliament about some time I spent in the last month with the Australian Defence Force as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. The parliamentary program allows members of parliament to spend a week with our defence forces to better understand how they operate, how they interact with each other and the important work that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year I was pleased to attend the Lone Pine Barracks at Singleton in New South Wales. I was able to visit the School of Infantry and get a better understanding of how the School of Infantry trains our soldiers before they go off to their regiments. It was an amazing experience for me, and I'd like to thank some of those Defence Force members who made me feel very welcome and gave me a full experienceâ€”and when I say 'full', I'll describe to you some of those experiences as part of the training. Thank you to Captain Curtis Tofa for hosting me and looking after me during that week. Thank you to the Coral Platoon, headed by Lieutenant Compton and Sergeant O'Leary, where I was able to witness the training of not just the infantry trainees but also the gap year trainees who are going through the process. I was also able to do some navigating training with them and see how their theory based learning was structured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent some time with the Borneo Platoon, led by Lieutenant Nick Maguire and Sergeant Meacham. I was able to see the final stages of what they called def-ops, which I misinterpreted when I first heard. It is defensive ops and it is where the platoon had dug in for a number of days before they had a series of mock attacks against them. That platoon then went on to do their final stages of assessment, in a process called 'hardcore'. It was extremely hard. I was able to witness exactly what they went through and to see the training techniques.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Major Timothy Butcher, the commander of Depot Company, and Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Flanagan, also the commanding officer, for allowing me to spend time with the troops as they were training. It was an environment where, as a member of parliament, I was able to camp out for a couple of nights with the troops during their training. They were very keen to demonstrate 'simunition' to me and on me to allow me to understand just how it feels, in a training environment, when you're shot. I think it was an important demonstrationâ€”and it was one I won't forget. The professionalism of those that train our next generation of Defence Force members was something that very much impressed me, and I thank them for allowing me to spend time with them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I rise to speak about endometriosis. But, before I do that, I want to associate myself with the previous speaker's comments about Depot Company. I was an instructor with Depot Company back in the day, and it was a great privilege to train Australian soldiers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for Canberra, Gai Brodtmann, and the member for Forrest, Nola Marino, for their years of fighting to raise awareness of endometriosis and the debilitating impact it has on women across Australia. Their work inspired me to consider how we can better support women suffering from endo in Darwin and Palmerston in Top End. I spoke in this chamber and then I reached out to those women in our community who are suffering from endo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this journey I had the privilege of meeting Libby Schoch, an amazing Territorian who suffers from endo. I want to congratulate and thank Libby for taking on the crucial role of NT coordinator of Endo Australia and for her passion and commitment to improving services and support for Territory women with endo. Libby and I recently held a roundtable in Darwin to hear from Territory women about their experiences and the challenges that they face living with endo. The group described how the debilitating pain and lack of community awareness about endo impact their lives, their ability to participate in family activities, their ability to exercise and their ability to work. They talked about the often crippling financial impact, the difficulty accessing pain relief or being accused of being a drug seeker, and the impact that all of this has on their mental and emotional wellbeing and that of their families. It is difficult to comprehend the frustration, anguish and sense of hopelessness that these women have endured from years, in many cases, of not being taken seriously, being turned away from emergency departments, the gaps in the continuity of care and the challenges they've encountered accessing services and expertise necessary to manage their complex cases. We need to do better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, 8 September, Libby will host the inaugural meeting of the Darwin Endo Support Group at my office in Casuarina, in Darwin. I hope that this can be the first step in building a dedicated support network for Territory women suffering from endo. We sometimes underestimate the powerful effect that a small group of committed individuals can have, and I'm confident that, with their willingness to work together, the Darwin Endo Support Group will raise awareness of endo across government, healthcare professionals and the broader Territory community. From the generosity of them sharing their stories and from talking to health professionals, I'm sure that we all want to do better and support these women the best that we can.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  None of us gets to this place alone. We arrive here only with the support of dedicated volunteers and party membersâ€”people who spend time on the phones, at the booths and on the doors. Bill Griffiths is one of those people. He's a dedicated member of the Labor Party and, more importantly, continues to be an active member of the Bridgewater community in my electorate. Bill recently celebrated his 90th birthday, and I had the great privilege of hosting a morning tea in my office to celebrate the occasion. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you spend a few minutes with Bill, it can easily turn into half an hour or more. His life story is remarkable. Born in Liverpool in England, Bill experienced a rough childhood. Like so many working-class families in the industrial northern English cities of 1928, Bill's family suffered from the twin evils of extreme poverty and alcohol related violence. His twin sister was sold when she was two, and, at the age of eight, on the eve of World War II, Bill was kicked out into the streets with only his dog as company. Young Bill visited orphanages and convents for food and to wash, and he lived on the streets until he was old enough to enlist. He started an apprenticeship as a piano and organ repairer and says he did well at it, but one day he was a bit mouthy with a customer and was fired. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the war ended, Bill, barely out of his teens, arrived in Australia and it was a new world of opportunity opening before his eyes. For years Bill worked in Tasmania's mining sector. Bill has spent the majority of his life, so far, in Tasmania, but he was able to reconnect with his twin sister some years ago. She had stayed in Liverpool all these years with her new family. He also met his older brother, who lives in the US.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill settled in Bridgewater, then a new suburb north of Hobart, where he started his own family. His adult children have since spread across the state, but Bill has stayed put in Bridgewater, where he remains an active and well-loved member of the local community. Bill's commitment to helping people is unmatched. He is heavily involved in local schools, where he conducts woodworking workshops and is an advocate for Tasmania's Indigenous people. He is a regular visitor to my Bridgewater office, where we enjoy a cup of tea and lots of talk. He is enormously respected, and, despite the hardships that life threw at him in his early years, he is always cheerful, always positive and always willing to lend a hand. So I say to Bill: thank you for the services you have provided to the Labor Party over your lifetime to date, and, especially, for your ongoing dedication to community. Many happy returns, Bill.</span>

A couple of weeks ago I held a forum in a place called Arno Bay on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula, which is probably at centre of the worst of it. Since that time, we've had some rain, but rain doesn't put pasture in the paddock or crops in the ground. It's very late in the season and the paddocks are already in a very advanced state of drift and erosion. So we have serious problems. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that meeting I have been working hard to try to marry up different ends. I welcome very much the government's actions across the board on drought relief, which would see a couple, for instance, farming there be eligible for up to about $46,000 worth of assistance over the next 12 months. My office has been contacted by people wanting to help and wanting to make donations. The South Australian bowls association contacted me and said, 'What can we do?' I said, 'Donate money and make sure that it goes to South Australian organisations.' Other people have done the same. There has been one new charity, if you like, formed on Eyre Peninsula. It is called Epic Charitable Trust and is teaming up with Mentally Fit EP in Port Lincoln. They are delivering fodder and are also planning to bale straw in the more favourable areas after harvest. Donations are helping with the baling costâ€”farmers are donating the strawâ€”and with the transport. I'm encouraging people to donate to that cause. In fact, the other day I called in on Sunrise Christian School's stall at the Whyalla Show. Their proceeds are going to exactly that fund. The other organisation I've contacted is Buy a Bale, which is an eastern state organisation. It has committed to me that it will put South Australia on its site and is welcoming applications from South Australians. I'm still making sure that it is actually getting put on its site, but its commitment to me is that that is what will happen. Of course, if people donate to that cause it will be tax deductible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are others around, but I'm just trying to get out the message that people can help and their help would be appreciated. Of course, South Australians would really like to see that help go to South Australians first. Those are the organisations I'm recommending at this stage, and I will continue to work with them. The other thing I did was contact Viterra, which controls the grain storage network. It has limited supplies of mixed grains available, but those mixed grains will be available for seeding to stabilise the soil.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Dementia is the second-leading cause of the death of Australians, contributing to one in 20 deaths in men and one in 10 deaths in women. In 2016, dementia became the leading cause of death among Australian women, surpassing heart disease, which had been the leading cause of death for men and women since the early 20th century. Women now account for two out of three dementia related deaths in Australia. It is estimated that there are 425,000 Australians living with dementia. Every day another 250 people are diagnosed with dementia and 36 people die from dementia. These figures from Dementia Australia demonstrate the impact of dementia in our community and the important need for urgent action. Researchers are working to find a cure, with more than $60 million a year being spent on dementia research in Australia. The Dementia Australia Research Foundation, supported by donations from the public, plays a major role in this effort and funds a number of researchers through scholarships and grants.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm passionate about raising funds for Dementia Australia, and for this reason I'm holding the Grant McBride Memory Walk in Long Jetty on Saturday, 8 September. It is in memory of my late father, who passed away this year at 68 after living with younger onset dementia for more than five years. It is for the 6,000 people currently living with dementia on the coast and their thousands of carers. It's about the care providers and the volunteers who provide support services, and it's about our community, a community that recognises the importance of creating a dementia-friendly community, one that welcomes people with dementia, supports their carers and allows them to live well and enjoy their life.</span>

In the last few weeks, there have been a number of outstanding players selected for high honours. Tyler Gaddes and Jake Lambeth have both been selected in the School Sport Australia under-16 team to tour Europe next year. Toby Power was ranked in the top two umpires at the School Sport Australia under-16 championships, being chosen to umpire the final. Not to be outdone, Justin Alford won a record sixth-straight gold medal at the Hockey Australia Country Championships playing for the New South Wales Country side. He was also rewarded by being selected in the Australian Country Representative Squad to play New Zealand. Tiahnee Cropper was named in the Australian Country under-21 women's team. This team will compete in the upcoming Oceania Pacific Cup in Fiji. Rounding off the list are six juniors, all of whom have been selected to represent New South Wales at the Hockey Australia under-13 national championships in Hobart in October. They are Keaton Stutt, Jesse McGarvie, Josh Perry, Mackenna Ensbey, Jemma Whelan and Breah Fischer.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maria Felton has received a Commendation for Brave Conduct from the Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. On 30 October 2013, on her way to work, she came across a head-on collision between a car and a ute on the Lawrence Road. The car was smoking and Maria could see flames starting to spread. She immediately called triple 0 and then rushed over to the ute to see what she could do for the driver trapped behind the wheel. The doors of the ute were badly damaged. Maria couldn't get them open, so she tried to pull the driver through the broken window. Thanks to the help of another motorist who had stopped at the scene, they managed to get the driver, Reece Campbell, out of the window. Shortly after that the car, which had been smoking, blew up into a huge fireball. Sadly, a young woman in her 20s did not survive the accident. Maria was nominated for the award by Reece's uncle, Stan Bright, to show his appreciation for her actions on saving his nephew that day. Thank you and congratulations to Maria.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Last Thursday when I left Canberra, I headed back to my electorate in Marrickville for what was a celebration hosted by the Inner West Council and local community groups Save Marrickville and Save Dully which was held at Marrickville Town Hall. It was a celebration of the reversal of the New South Wales Liberal government's decision to have its Sydenham to Bankstown Urban Renewal Strategy, which would have seen massive overdevelopment along the rail corridor of the Sydenham to Bankstown train line, which is currently slated for metro conversion. It spelt the destruction of many pockets of the inner-west heritage, character and communityâ€”houses that are single-dwelling, single storey and, in some cases, double, cleared away to make way for massive towers. The fact is that we need to increase density along rail corridors, but it needs to be done in a sensitive way that is in the spirit and, indeed, not only preserves but also enhances the character of local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local planning powers being given to Macquarie Street and taken away from the local community is not sensible policy. I pay tribute to the current Minister for Planning in New South Wales, Anthony Roberts, who was prepared to sit down with the Mayor of the Inner West Council, Darcy Byrne, and me, as the federal shadow minister for cities, and restore those planning powers to the Inner West Council and to Canterbury-Bankstown council. It will result in a much better outcome for the community. One of the things that caused such a revolt by local members of the community was the proposal of Mirvac down at Carrington Road which would have seen an old industrial area where there is just one road in and one road out, built in a flood plain, have four 35-storey towers. Within a couple of weeks of that proposal being made public, at a meeting organised by the council, Jo Haylen, the local state member for Summer Hill, and I, we packed out Marrickville Town Hall. This is a sensible proposal. There is a message here also for the development community: sit down with the local community members and work with them; don't seek to impose overdevelopment which destroys the character of local communities. Congratulations to all involved in this community campaign.</span>

The High Tea was arranged to raise funds for the Mental Health Arts Development program run by Jubilee. More than $3,000 was raised at the event. It was very well attended. There would have been well in excess of 100 people there. I drew the raffle on the day, and there were many great items that had been donated for the purpose of that raffle. Thanks to the general manager, Lance Rickards; the community development officer, Maree Gunn; and everyone else at Jubilee. In its new premises at Mortdale, Jubilee has gone from strength to strength. It is a very well-led organisation, and it was great to support it on the day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 August I visited Revesby Public School to talk to the year 5 and 6 students. They're studying government, learning all about our democracy. It was great to talk to them about parliament, the things that happen down here in the parliamentary system in Canberra and the work of the local MP in their electorate. We had a great Q&amp;A session. As is so often the case, the questions from the kids were very insightful and very impressive. Thanks to the principal, Narelle Nies, for everything that she does for the Revesby Public School community, and thank you to the kids for all their great questions on the day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 August I visited East Hills Girls Technology High School, a school with a tremendous reputation for technical education. That reputation has been well deserved over many decades. I met with a year 10 science class to talk about STEMâ€”science, technology, engineering and mathematicsâ€”as part of a program run in schools in conjunction with the CSIRO, particularly focused on the next generation of young female leaders in those professions. I had a great discussion with the class about future career opportunities. It was also good to see them working on some ideas about the careers of the future. Thanks to Principal Jennifer Hardwick and teacher Suzanne Ford for their hospitality on the day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect that Banks has one of the strongest Scouting communities anywhere in Australia. On 7 August I visited the 2nd Panania Scout Group for their District Club Campfire, which included three other fantastic Scout troops from Banksâ€”2nd Mortdale, Oatley Bay and Picnic Point. We have a very strong and proud scouting community in the Banks area, and every year the annual campfire is held and different troops get together. Thanks to Rachel McClelland, for her leadership of the group at Panania, and to Andrew Plunkett and all the other leaders who do so much to create opportunities for our local kids.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  This chamber has heard many, many times about the trials and tribulations we have had with the NBN here in Canberra and the fact that, until about 18 months ago, Canberra was just one big blank space on the NBN rollout map. We kept looking and looking and looking, but we were just one big blank space. The Turnbull government hadn't even bothered to think about the fact that we might want NBN, despite the fact that we had some of the worst internet speeds not in the country, but in the worldâ€”less than one megabit per second in the south-east area of Tuggeranong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We finally get on the rollout mapâ€”hoorah!â€”we're all looking forward to NBN coming and then there is delay after delay after delay after delay. The time line gets kicked further and further and further down the road. We're also presented with a patchwork of technologies. We've got fibre to the node, fibre to the curb and fibre to the premisesâ€”sometimes all in the same street! And then, when we do finally get on the map and we get a time line, when it actually comes to the NBN being rolled out, the experience has been less than optimal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about a few examples of that today. Over the winter break I was contacted by a Canberran who lives in Theodore, which is in that area of south-east Tuggeranong. It's a suburb that's 15 kilometres from where we are here today. His adult son is profoundly deaf and relies on Australian Sign Language. The pair recently attended ACT Magistrates Court and a certified ASL interpreter from Sydney was provided for his son via an iPad. While the interpreter was terrific, the internet connection was not. The constituent wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The link constantly reset and disrupted communication among the parties in attendance. Our experience today is just another example of how poor internet affects us on a daily basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's someone with a challenge, with a disability, trying to communicate in a court environment. He had a fantastic interpreter, but the NBN let this person down. Someone with a disability, someone who is trying to engage, someone who is trying to realise their potential by engaging normally through a court environment has had their ability to do that significantly hampered by the lack of decent communication services. This is the reality of the NBN in my community. If you're lucky to get the NBN, well you're not that lucky. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I rise today to express my profound concerns about Victorian Labor's unfair funding deal for the Geelong region, which is very much a case of too little too late. I have proudly led the way in advocating for the Geelong rail duplication project and, on behalf of the Turnbull government, delivering $150 million for this important project, which is to duplicate the rail between South Geelong and Waurn Ponds and to upgrade the stations, those being Waurn Ponds, Marshall and South Geelong. Our government has also committed another $104 million for signalling and passing loop upgrades on the Warrnambool line. This is also important in order to deliver more frequent, reliable services, including through to Melbourne. As my constituents know, I have been campaigning up hill and down dale for faster rail to Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday Labor announced a $147 million election commitment only, meaning there is absolutely no funding to start construction on the Geelong rail duplication project. This is really disgraceful. It also represents about only 20 per cent of the cost of this project, which is not good enough. In contrast, the Turnbull government put $150 million on the table. We have that money there to spend on infrastructure in our community, but Daniel Andrews and his pathetic bunch of local Labor MPs have not delivered any money for construction of this important project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's also incredible is that the Regional Rail Link, Labor's grand vision, has turned into an absolute disaster as our region continues to grow rapidly, along with western Melbourne. Labor's treating Geelong commuters like second-rate citizens. A solution to this rail link is desperately needed. We need fast rail. We need reliable rail. We need rail that will give us the service that we as a community deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely untenable that the Labor government in Victoria has not in four years delivered any money for constructing Geelong rail for Corangamite commuters and for Geelong commuters. I absolutely condemn Daniel Andrews and the Labor government in Victoria. I call on Daniel Andrews to deliver this much-needed funding for rail construction.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I am pleased to be able to make some brief remarks on this interim report of the Select Committee on Intergenerational Welfare Dependence, although I must say at the outset that the debate that is generated by this interim report on the select committee's work, such as it is, completely misses the point. We see this in the narrowness of the review's terms of reference that have been proposed by Minister Tehan, as the member for Jagajaga identified in her contribution to this debate. This obscures the real problem that Australia's government should be getting on with solving. The problem is right before our eyes, which is that we have inequality risingâ€”inequality of wealth, inequality of income, inequality of opportunity and inequality of power. We see our social compact fraying under the blind adherence to trickle-down economics by this government and the commitment to ever deeper cuts to those payments and programs that used to constitute a very effective social safety net. It also shows the narrowness of this government's vision. It is those two issues that I want to explore as we discuss this interim report, such as it is and such as it might be, and the wider issue of how we can structure a social compact between Australians and between Australians and their government that is fit for our 21st-century purposes to be the society we can and should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the government's agenda here and that of the Australian Labor Party could not be more striking. We can start here with the work done over the last parliament by the member for Jagajaga, who was at the time the shadow minister, in taking a deep consultative look at the challenge of social policymaking in Australia. This, of course, did not come in a vacuum. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, it built on Labor's legacy in government. This proud legacy is largely driven by the work of the member for Jagajaga through her initiative at the very start of raising the pension age, through expanding the boundaries of our social compact in a revolutionary way with the introduction of the NDIS and through her deep commitment to reducing disadvantage wherever it's found and making it clear that that is a core responsibility of government, including those matters directly connected to the terms of reference of this select committee inquiryâ€”the issues of entrenched disadvantage and particularly challenges facing particular communities and particular individuals in accessing the formal labour market. These are complex challenges and require a considered and holistic response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry is not the way to go about it. The work of the shadow minister in the last parliament, as I said, presents a useful contrast. The first point I would make in that regard is about the initiation of this select committee. It was said by one of my colleagues that it appeared as if by magic on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span><span style="font-style:italic;">â€”</span>no real way for any government, or any group of parliamentarians even, to commit themselves to an enterprise of this nature. When Labor considered these issues as part of a wider look at our social policy challenges of the present and of the future, we of course consulted widely. We consulted with all of the sectorâ€”organisations like ACOSS and the brotherhood and community based organisationsâ€”recognising the increasingly spatially-driven nature of disadvantage in Australia, including in suburbs within the Scullin electorate. We looked hard at the evidence and we listened equally hard to communities and individuals directly affected, so that our programs and our policies could respond to concerns that are real and felt within the community, not imagined constructs of ideology. Really, this is the nub of this question that so starkly divides the parliament and perhaps also too many Australians. On the government benches, we see a cruel, ideological focus when these terms of reference are looked at in a clear light. We see, as the member for Jagajaga has said, a relentless gaze on the so-called undeserving poor, as opposed to a commitment from all of us to recognise that different life circumstances present different barriers to full participation in life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, of course, includes economic participation in the form of workâ€”we are the Labor Party; we are the party of work and the party of jobsâ€”but also participation in society more broadly. The two cannot be easily separated, and they should not be easily separated. In that regard, Deputy Speaker Andrews, I see that this government has come quite some way from the big society that you promised early in your tenure as the minister, under the government led by the member for Warringah. I thought that that was an illusionary promise, but at least it presented an aspiration for all in our society to equally participate. It presented a clear vision of a way forward, obviously reflecting some engagement with the government led by David Cameron in the UK on a way to harness innovation and enterprise within the third sector as a way of driving better outcomes for the most disadvantaged. As I say, it's not an agenda that I find compelling or attractive, but at least it was a genuine and considered attempt to deal with a real problemâ€”not simply to break up Australians into categories based on their circumstances in life. And so, Deputy Speaker Andrews, I find myself, perhaps not for the first time this week, in agreement with you on a matter of public policy. May there be further opportunities for agreement as the weeks continue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is worth touching upon, because, while the policy drive behind big society is something with which I would disagree, the breadth of aspiration is something that I think we should all have regard to. If we are serious about welfareâ€”welfare provision and cycles of welfare dependenceâ€”we should be looking at the whole picture. We should be giving consideration to how our economy works and how that shapes our society. If we approach these questions in a narrow way, we miss the point, which, for me, on this side of politics, is to build a good society. That is the fundamental responsibility, in my view, of Australia's government. Our job here, I believe, is to articulate what the constituent parts of a good society are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I go about my electorate and when I have the opportunity to visit the electorates of my colleagues, as part of my responsibilities in the schools portfolio or otherwise, these are the questions that I try to articulate, not just to discuss with people what is challenging them in their lives today, in education or otherwise, but to ask them to consider what a good government could do, a government which is listening and a government which is on their side, to make a difference, to open up opportunities and to remove barriers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the challenge with which any responsible minister for social services should be grappling. It is, of course, a complex challenge, but it is a challenge that will be impossible to overcome unless it is accompanied by a high-level vision of what a more equal society may look likeâ€”as I said, what the component parts of that are. Access to employment, in my view, has to be a part of it, and we have to look at the barriers to employment. A history of family dependence on welfare is one marker. Disability is, unfortunately, another marker. Youth, it appears, has become a key marker of inability to access formal employment and, particularly, secure employment. This is particularly concentrated in some communities in the outer suburbs and the regions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are complex reasons which underpin that, and they go to the complex interactions between the world of work and our various programs that support people who are either out of work or at the fringe of the labour market. They also go, of course, to our responsibilities in the field of education. We know that early years education is the best investment governments can make, yet this government, under Minister Birmingham, has been neglecting its responsibilities quite cruelly. We know that, second to that, schools education is the biggest driver of change, and year 12 completion is a shocking but reliable indicator of life opportunities more broadly. Yet this government is short-changing our students in all of our schools. Beyond that, we go to post-compulsory education, and it's very clear that we have not built a system that is ready for the world of work today, much less the world of work tomorrow. These are the questions the government should be having regard to, not a narrow focus on one segment of the community, even if their desire is to improve their circumstances. I urge the government to take a broader look.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I rise to speak today on the annual investment statement by the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Australian governments and our business community know from deep experience that foreign investment is, and always has been, critical to our prosperity. Investment, initially from the United Kingdom, then other European nations, the United States, Japan and, more recently, China, Korea and our ASEAN neighbours, has helped develop Australia throughout our recent history, and that trend continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment said yesterday, foreign investment spurs economic growth, creates jobs and raises the standard of living of all Australians. Foreign investment does this by bringing a whole range of benefits to Australia. It provides access to foreign capital required to fuel ongoing expansion of our economy, particularly in key export sectors such as resources and agriculture. It provides access to cutting-edge technology and innovation from around the world. It provides access for our companies to global value chains. It provides access to international markets through the trade relationships that result. And it provides access for Australians to new job opportunities and to competitively priced products and services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In turn, Australia offers significant benefits to foreign investors: a long history of stable economic growth; a predictable regulatory environment for business; access to world-class resource and agriculture assets; world-class research-and-development capabilities, through our universities and research institutes; a sophisticated domestic consumer market; and access to significant regional markets through our FTA agreements. Our largest export industries, including resources and agriculture, could not have been built to the scale they are without foreign investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foreign investment is also important in the tourism sector, particularly through new investment in tourism accommodation and facilities that are needed to support the ongoing growth in tourist numbers visiting Australia. As Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, I had the opportunity to attend the recent launch of the NTT Dimension Data Client Innovation Centre in Sydney, a significant investment from the largest ICT company in Japan that is creating high-tech jobs for Australians, providing a channel for our companies to access cutting-edge Japanese technology, facilitating knowledge-sharing and enhancing opportunities for Australian businesses and universities to collaborate with Japanese partners. It was a wonderful opportunity for me to see this collaboration between our two countries in this important sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my overseas visits as assistant minister, I have welcomed the opportunity to promote the importance of an open and liberal environment for global trade and investment with ministerial counterparts from around the Asia-Pacific region. I've also welcomed the opportunity to meet foreign companies that have invested in Australia, to hear firsthand their perspectives on Australia as an investment destination, and to talk to Australian businessmen who have expanded their businesses through investment in key international markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As assistant minister, I have been actively involved in promoting Australia's existing FTAs, and in supporting the minister to expand our network of FTAs to include more and more of Australia's most important trade and investment partners. These FTAs create a conducive environment for investment in both directions. Through the investment provisions of these agreements, they facilitate foreign investment that helps Australian companies to capitalise on export opportunities created by the FTAs. And as I mentioned earlier, our free trade agreements with key Asian economies are a significant attraction for investors from Europe and North America, as they provide preferential access to high-growth consumer markets to our immediate north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to highlight recent government initiatives to ensure foreign investment is in Australia's best interest. These include: strengthening and clarifying the Foreign Investment Review Board rules, the establishment of a register of agricultural land, the introduction of critical infrastructure provisions and the modification of corporate taxation rules to ensure foreign businesses are meeting their obligations. I commend the annual investment statement of the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  Today, a Prime Minister who won a general election narrowly survived a challenge to his leadership. If the member for Wentworth had lost the prime ministership, he would have been the fourth consecutive Australian Prime Minister in the past decade to win an election, only to be removed before completing the term. This week, we've also seen the Prime Minister take the extraordinary step of abandoning his support for action on climate change in order to protect his job. We've seen conservative backbenchers led by the member for Warringah, the former Prime Minister, do everything in their power to destroy their own government. These ideological warriors aren't here to pursue the national interest. They want arguments, not solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week's events illustrate the issue that I want to raise in this evening's grievance debate: the decade-long degeneration of this country's political culture. Wherever I go in this country Australians tell me the same thing: they are tired of people shouting at each other; they're tired of the division and discord. They also despair at a political culture that so readily disposes of elected prime ministers. Above all, they're angry that negative politics is acting as a handbrake on national progress. Let me give you one example. Ten years ago, in 2007, there was a political consensus in an election, when John Howard and Kevin Rudd both went to the election committed to having an emissions trading schemeâ€”a market based solution to drive down emissions. A decade later, we still don't have a solution. The government has been in place now for five years without a policy. Without the Renewable Energy Target that had been set by the former Labor government, we wouldn't be having anywhere near the drive-down of emissions, and prices would be even higher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the Prime Minister stood up in parliament and said that he wouldn't pursue an emissions target as part of the National Energy Guarantee, not because Labor wouldn't support him but because Labor might. He would rather lose that policy framework because he was in a circumstance whereby he couldn't guarantee that all members of the coalition would vote for it on the floor of the parliament. I think the style of politics brought in by Tony Abbott in 2009, who some say was a successful Leader of the Opposition, isn't quite right. Whilst the member for Warringah was successful, from one perspective, at creating chaos and a feeling of conflict on the floor of the parliament with his daily interruptions in question time and moving suspensions of standing orders, the problem is that when he was successful in being elected in 2013 he didnâ€™t have a plan to actually govern the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem now is that the coalition has been infected by the toxic approach. It is divided. It is distracted. It's dysfunctional. It stumbles from one internal conflict to the next, unable to muster the unity of purpose required to deliver effective government. While the previous Labor government was a good government, we also allowed ourselves to be derailed by division. I've said before and I say again tonight that it was a mistake to remove a first-term elected Prime Minister on 23 June 2010. But, while Labor has learnt from that mistake, it appears from today's challenge, the coalition is doomed to repeat it. The member for Warringah's glove puppet, the member for Dickson, will be back for another go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite need to reconsider their approach. If they hope to serve the Australian people, they should ask themselves what Australians want out of life and how we in this place can help them to achieve those aims. The key aspiration of Australians is to live productive, enjoyable lives, to give their children more opportunities than they enjoyed and to leave the environment in better shape than they found it. But, for months now, the Prime Minister and his ministers have misused the term 'aspiration'. They have accused Labor of standing in the way of aspiration because we oppose their plan to cut taxes for wealthy individuals and multinational corporations. Their argument seems to be that aspiration is just about the top end. This is absurd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Australians have personal aspirations, they extend beyond individual needs. They have aspirations for themselves but also for their family, for their community, for their environment and, indeed, for the national interest. Australians aspire to a whole range of thingsâ€”many of which this government refuses to support. My grievance is with a government that chooses to serve the aspirations of the few by undermining the aspirations of the many. Of course Australians want to improve their living standards and feel comfortable. But, in the land of the fair go, people think beyond their individual needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our aspirations extend to the welfare of our families and our communities; the health of our environment; a nation where schools and universities are properly resourced; a nation that devotes resources to skills training for young Australians, rather than cutting apprenticeships and importing skilled workers on a temporary basis; and a nation where people can be confident that, if they or their children become ill, a well-resourced health system will be able to meet their needs. Australians also aspire to the maintenance of a good social safety net. That's because in this country most people believe we are only as good as the way we treat our least advantaged members. Commuters aspire to live in a nation that invests in public transport, so they can get home from work in time to play with their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these aspirations relate to quality of life, and all of them are just as important and just as meaningful as the spirit of entrepreneurship that drives business and creates jobs. Yet on all of these quality-of-life measures, the government has been found wanting. We're still getting cuts to health and education. We're getting cuts to vocational training. We're getting the social safety net being undermined. We're not seeing investment in important public transport projects, like Melbourne Metro and Cross River Rail. The irony is that, while the Prime Minister and his colleagues champion tax cuts for the wealthy few in the name of aspiration, the cuts to services undermine everyone else's ability to achieve their aspirations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition wants to replace this nation's cultural respect for egalitarianism and the fair go with the conservative creed to individualism and self-interest. They want Australians to embrace their view that the free market can cure all ills and people should be blamed and punished for their own disadvantage. They believe in the trickle-down effect: if we help people at the top, somehow people at the bottom and in the middle will benefit. To quote that great Australian Darryl Kerrigan, 'Tell them they're dreaming.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the 1996 federal election, then Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating famously warned:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When the government changes, the country changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Keating had it half right: incoming governments do attempt to imprint their own culture and philosophy on the societies that they govern. Sometimes this changes prevailing views or social values; however, some Australian values are immutable. One of those is the fair go, the idea that everyone deserves a chance to be their best and that Australians help each other out in times of need. Throughout our history, the fair go has been the constant moderating force against the excesses of conservative ideology. That's why in 2007, for example, Australians rejected John Howard's WorkChoices legislation, which sought to destroy trade unions. It's why Australians supported Gough Whitlam's introduction of universal health care in 1973, and supported it again under the Hawke government, after it was abolished by the Fraser government. It is also why Australians now, wherever they live, care about people who are suffering from the drought in rural and regional Australia, and are putting their hands into their own pockets to help out people who they have never met and are unlikely to ever meet. It's also why Australians are so disappointed with this bitterly divided rabble of a government. This government needs to get its act together in the national interest.</span>

                  <a href="249764" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  When we are elected by our constituents to serve in this place, we are handed a job to do. We are handed the hopes and responsibility of tens of thousands of good, hardworking people and those of their families. We are sent here to stand up for our people, to deliver for our people, to always keep our people in our minds and to always advocate for policies that benefit our people. I have always fought for the people of Capricornia, and I'm proud of the record of delivery we have achieved by remaining local, by focusing on what our people need. It's this mentality that delivers the projects that Central Queensland needs and it is this mentality that I will continue to implement, to fight for what Central Queenslanders need and deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always focused on infrastructure that makes a difference: infrastructure that makes a difference to people; infrastructure that makes a difference to families; and infrastructure that makes a difference to the economyâ€”infrastructure like the Rockhampton Hospital car park, a solution to a major source of frustration in the past for Central Queenslanders. This, along with jobs, was a hot issue for the real people of Rockhampton back in 2016. Families visiting loved ones in care and those who required care themselves were forced to share a tiny, single-level car park, akin to what you may find at a small suburban shopping centreâ€”a gross underresourcing for a major regional base hospital that services a population of 200,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took this issue forward. I took the issue of the need for a new car park for the Rockhampton Hospital to anyone who would listen. I advocated for the needs of my people, and we eventually, during the 2016 election, secured $7 million to help the state government do precisely what they are doing now: building a magnificent three-storey car park to take pressure off suburban streets and make the experience of visiting the hospital, often a stressful and emotional time, just that little bit more pleasant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is nice to be able to make someone's difficult day a bit better, to deliver infrastructure that gives that person a new or better job is even more rewarding. Rookwood Weir has sat on the books of the Queensland government for decades as a promising water infrastructure project. While having it on the books is one thing, to stump up and deliver the funding for it is another thing altogether. Unfortunately, Labor state governments in Queensland are almost allergic to building real job-creating infrastructure. I believe in the project because I know how hard our farmers work and how much our CQ farmers are able to achieve when they get the water they need to thrive. Water infrastructure has had a transformative effect on communities where major investments have been made. I want the same thing for CQ communities like Rockhampton, Gracemere, Yeppoon and Marlborough. These are communities that deserve the benefits of a more-diverse economy. These are communities that will make the most of the jobs and growth delivered by new water infrastructure and the subsequent agriculture boom. Being able to grow macadamias, rice, lucerne and tree crops, to develop feedlots or to irrigate pasture where dryland grazing previously dominated opens up a great deal of investment and job opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does Rookwood Weir promise to deliver more jobs; it promises to deliver lots of new jobs. This project will create over 2,000 new jobs and over $1 billion worth of extra economic productivity. This is a serious project for the region, and one I have been proud to push every inch of the way. It would appear now that, after a lengthy period of foot dragging, the Queensland government have finally come on board. We look forward to them getting on with building this major project next year after the wet season has ended. All I can say is: it's about time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To see these projects underway is certainly very rewarding, but rather than make me feel like the job has been done, it keeps me keen to listen to the people of Central Queensland and keep an eye to the future. There are plenty of projects to keep CQ moving forward, especially in the transport sector. Central Queensland is home to the coal and beef capitals and, as such, our road networks have to put up with a lot of heavy traffic. Road trains, B-doubles, cranes and low-loaders are all common combinations met on one's travels around Capricornia. It's certainly not a rare thing to have to leave the road to let a particularly large wide load pass. Massive dump and haul trucks, with wheels and trays removed so that they fit on the trailers that carry them, travel from the service and sales centres of Rockhampton and Mackay in the east to the vast array of coalmines of the bountiful Bowen Basin in the west and back again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it's not one of these extreme loads, our roads carry thousands of heads of cattle and millions of tonnes of grain and goods. Our truck drivers keep Australia going, but our trucks certainly place a strain on our road network. That's why we need to continue to deliver safer and stronger roads. It's a job that's never over, but it's a job that is vital to the productivity of Central Queensland. The coalition has devoted great funding to roads already, with over $10 billion committed to Queensland's most important highwayâ€”the Bruce Highway. We have seen great improvements and we must continue this process so that Central Queenslanders get to enjoy the same standards as our neighbours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have my sights set on a suite of vital road upgrades across the electorate that I know Central Queenslanders need, because they have told me so. The Fitzroy Development Road, which is better known to the locals as the beef road, runs from Dingo in the south to Nebo in the north, covering some 235 kilometres of rather remote cattle country. This road is a vital link for the beef producers of the area. This area represents a large section of the Brigalow scheme of the 1970s, which saw millions of hectares of Brigalow country developed and broken up to create some of the country's most productive tropical cattle land. This makes the so-called beef road a heavily used route for the beef industry, as cattle transport between the properties of the area to the saleyards and abattoirs of Gracemere and Rockhampton. The road also carries significant amounts of grain and services to the mining industries based around Middlemount and Dysart. All this traffic is very good for the economy, but, unfortunately, takes a toll on the road surface.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited the beef road recently with local residents and beef producers. James Pisaturo and Tamara Finger raised serious concerns about a range of spots along the road that need urgent attention. Many of these spots don't look terribly bad when you first look at them, but the accidents that continue to occur because of them are dangerous and prove that lives are put at risk every day they go unrepaired. Many trucks have run off the road at different trouble spots, placing at risk not only their loads but also the lives of the drivers and other motorists. This is just one example of why we need to attack this road with the funding it deserves and that the state government denies it. I'm fighting for the beef road and the people who not only call it home but also need it improved so that they can get home safely each day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the other end of the road spectrum is the heavy vehicle ring road for Rockhampton. This project means a great deal to Rockhampton. It promises to deliver the much-needed third bridge for Rockhampton, relieving a great deal of the daily traffic pressure from the two existing bridges across the mighty Fitzroy. By providing this third bridge we will open the opportunity to get over 3,000 heavy vehicles out of the heart of the city, making our streets not only easier to navigate but also somewhat safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The heavy vehicle ring road promises so much more than just an alternative route for heavy traffic. Something I continue to hear about and continue to prioritise is jobs. The heavy vehicle ring road will deliver jobs in abundance. The last major road project we secured around Rocky was the Yeppen South project, and the employment it created was immense. The ring road is estimated to cost and employ triple the figures of the Yeppen South during construction, as well as help open up our industrial zones in Gracemere and Parkhurst, further driving employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some of the best tradespeople in Central Queensland. Their handiwork can be enormous and needs an appropriate road network. The heavy vehicle ring road will provide a much more efficient avenue for these products to get to where they are going without needing to be traipsed through the heart of the city. This project really is a win, win. It will provide better and safer roads, more jobs and more opportunities for Central Queensland. I'll keep up my fight for these projects and look forward to discussing them with the relevant ministers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I rise once more in this place to talk about the enormous contribution that has been made to my electorate, to my state and to our country by those who were born in India and have come to make this country their home. As you would know, Deputy Speaker Andrews, particularly from when you were a very capable minister for immigration, we have a very rapidly growing Indian community, many of whom have come to settle in my constituency of Holt. According to the 2016 census, the Indian-born population in Australia has grown to 455,389. That's up from the 295,000 recorded in the 2011 census. Of Australia's 25 million people, 1.9 per cent were born in India. The 2016 census showed that Victoria had the highest number of residents born in India, totalling 169,802, including 14,717 who were born in India and reside in my constituency. Along with showing an increase in the number of people born in India who live in Australia, the 2016 census revealed how Indian languages have grown in Australia. Hindi came out as the top Indian language spoken at home in Australia, with 159,652 speakers, with Punjabi a close second at 132,496. There were also big jumps in the number of speakers of Tamil, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Telugu, Marathi and Kannada.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are statistics and numbers, but they represent people who were born in India and have come to this country. They are part of the success of our country and where our country will go. Australia has a lot to offer people who come to this country, abide by our laws and our values, make this country their home and create a future for themselves. In my engagement with the Indian community in all its forms, from whichever part of India they come, there is an abiding and deep love of education. There is a deep commitment to the community. Also, from the number of festivals that I attend and participate in, there is a great sense of inclusiveness. People who come to this country from India make Australia their home. I use as an example a City of Casey citizenship ceremony I attended recently, where we had I think 225 residents who became new citizens of our country. We had the pleasure of meeting each one of those people after they had become a citizen. The enthusiasm for our country, particularly from those who were born in India, and their hopes and dreams about what they wanted for their children and their families was what struck me. So they not only make Australia their home but bring the unique richness of their culture, history and values to our country, and that makes our country a better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I'll single out a grouping that I've had the pleasure of dealing with, the Casey Garba, a team that was led by Sepal Kumar Patel, Nikul Patel, Suresh Patel, Yogi Patel and Manish Patel. I awarded them a 2018 Holt Australia Day Award. Casey Garba is a festival that has been celebrated under the banner of the Casey multicultural festival association in Cranbourne over the past two years. This association was formed in 2016 to organise multicultural festivals with a variety of cultural groups for the purpose of engaging with the wider community in Casey and beyond. That is inclusivenessâ€”bringing their culture into ours and making our country richer as a consequence of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This organisation has celebrated many festivals since its formation, including Holi, Vasakhi, Lohari, Diwali and Garba. One of the key festivals of the organisation is Casey Garba, and in 2017 it attracted over 1,500 people. I had the pleasure of being there as their special guest. They represent the Gujarati community, and I thank them for sharing their culture and values. We are looking at the future of Australia when we see these people. They talk about our country with passion and prideâ€”with the exception, perhaps, of a discussion about the cricket, but we can have differences of opinion from time to time! They make an amazing contribution to our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly wanted to single out another organisation that I had the pleasure of dealing with, which was the Berwick Ayalkoottam. These are people from the Malayalee community from the state of Kerala. When I was conducting community safety forums in the outer south-eastern suburbs in June 2016, this community was amazingly supportive of what I was attempting to achieve. I believe that, as a consequence of the advocacy of this particular groupingâ€”particularly given the representations they made, in a respectful wayâ€”the Andrews government announced an increase in the level of policing in that region and also greater numbers of people recruited into the police force. That was because of the positive advocacy of this particular grouping. The people who have come from Kerala have made an enormous contribution to our country and to our local community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what makes me grieve tonight over what's happening in Kerala at the present period of time. I have many people in my constituency who were born in Kerala and who have come and made this country their home. What they're seeing in Kerala is causing them great concern because, as you would know Deputy Speaker Andrews, having worked with the Coptic community when you were immigration minister, they see people that are being killed who they may have some relationship with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far, from the statistics that we know about, 370 people have been killed, most of them in landslides in the recent flooding that's occurred there. As a consequence of the flooding in Kerala, we are also talking about the establishment of about 5,645 relief camps, because we've had nearly 800,000 people displaced as a consequence of those floods. An enormous disruption has been caused and the damage has been absolutely massive. The survivors at the evacuation centres described spending days without food and water, and, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">BBC News</span>, the head of the state's disaster management team said that they were preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of waterborne and airborne diseases in relief camps. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indian government has said the Kerala state is facing the worst flooding that it's seen in 100 years. They've opened about 80 dams so far. What has impressed me the most has been the desire of the local Indian community, in my region and across the state and the country, to proactively raise money to send back to aid the Kerala relief effort. For that, they have to be commended. In that vein, particularly to offer some hope to the constituents who live in my constituency and come from Kerala, I say tonight that I'm happy to work with you, particularly given the contribution that you have made in coming to our country and making our country your home. The community outreach work that is done by organisations like Berwick Ayalkoottam and other organisations is just astonishing. They have Christmas drives. These are people who have come to our country and have enriched our country with their culture. They are an outstanding success story of people who have come from another country and made Australia their home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those people, particularly those who live in my electorate, that we will working with the City of Casey Council in a bipartisan way to organise a fundraising event. We are hoping to secure Bunjil Place in October. This will be bipartisan. This is not political. This is not Liberal, Labor or anything else. This is about us working together, with whichever form of government we can, to provide assistance, with all of the communities in the Indian community in Victoria coming together to raise money for that specific purpose and to amplify to people the absolute scale of the destruction that's occurred as a consequence of the flooding and the landslides. Also perhaps we will encourage the Australian government to make representations to the Indian government, as federal Labor has done, to provide any support that we can to assist those people who have been badly affected in the state of Kerala. Again I commend the community for the work that it's doing to support the people from Kerala, and I will do my utmost as the local member to help provide that support to them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  On the afternoon of 5 July, John Edwards of Normanhurst murdered his son and daughter, 15-year-old Jack and 13-year-old Jennifer, in West Pennant Hills in my constituency. Later that night, Edwards took his own life. The nightmare that Olga, Jack and Jennifer's mother, has gone through in the last few weeks, and the pain that she will carry for the rest of her life, are unimaginable. My thoughts are with her at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The weeks since that night have been a difficult time in my community as we've tried to come to terms with what happened. We've all been asking ourselves the same question: how could something like this have happened in our peaceful community? The ripple effect of this tragedy has been significant throughout. Many people from all parts of the community have been affected, and much has been done to help. In particular, I've been concerned about the students and teachers at the schools that Jack and Jennifer attended and other surrounding schools in my area, and I've been in touch with the principals and directors of education and offered my support. I know the schools have provided counselling and support for Jack and Jennifer's friends and peers and other students and that this will need to be ongoing. I've been speaking with their next-door neighbours, Mr and Mrs Bruce Wilson, who've been supporting Olga during these most difficult weeks. They're the sorts of citizens who make me proud to represent our Berowra community. They're tough and resilient through adversity and, in the great Australian tradition, they're always there to support and comfort their neighbours in time of need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The exact story of what happened on 5 July is a matter for the coroner, and we'll hear in due course their findings. But people have expressed concerns about how a man with the reportedly violent history of Mr Edwards had managed to get hold of the gun. At Hornsby, in my electorate, there exists one of the few shooting ranges in Sydney. It is vital for the training of police and military and maintaining Australia's reputation as a world leader in sporting shooting. I was pleased to read media reports that the Ku-Ring-Gai Pistol Club in Hornsby declined to issue Mr Edwards with a firearm. It will be a matter for the coroner to determine how such a man, with his violent history, nevertheless managed to get access to firearms. One of the neighbours has written to me expressing his thoughts about gun control. His words were powerful, questioning whether guns should leave the premises of gun clubs. I have passed his thoughts on to the appropriate New South Wales ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The murder of Jack and Jennifer Edwards seems to have been an incident of domestic violence. Unfortunately, domestic violence exists in every community. Let me begin with some statistics to demonstrate just how pervasive and devastating domestic violence is in our society. In Australia, approximately 23 per cent of women have experienced at least one incident of domestic violence at the hands of a partner during their lifetime. On average, every week, more than one woman is killed by her partner in Australia. In New South Wales in 2016 there were over 3,000 people serving prison sentences who were family and domestic violence offenders. That's 24 per cent of all prisoners. On average, approximately 18 children are killed by a parent every year in Australia. Since September 2017 there has been a 68 per cent rise in the weekly contacts to the domestic violence hotline 1800RESPECT. These are disturbing figures, and we have a responsibility as a society, as a parliament and as individuals to confront them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there's clearly a long way to go, the government is working hard to address this deeply-rooted problem in our society. Firstly, we're combatting domestic violence at its roots. Secondly, we're working to ensure that we provide protection and support for the victims. The government's currently implementing the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. That plan has seen the government invest $20 million in primary prevention and early intervention initiatives; $15 million for frontline services to respond to violence experienced by women and children; $30 million for frontline legal assistance and family law services; $25 million towards Indigenous family violence; and $10 million towards responding to sexual violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research has demonstrated that children who experience violence by a family member, or who witness it in their home between other family members, are more likely to later experience partner violence as adults. For example, one in three women and one in six men who experience abuse before the age of 15 were three times more likely to experience partner violence as an adult than women or men who'd not experienced such violence or abuse before age 15. Around one in eight women and one in 10 men who, before the age of 15, witnessed violence towards their mother by a partner were around twice as likely to experience partner violence as an adult than those who'd not witnessed violence before 15. What these figures confirm is the vital importance of early intervention and prevention services. The government has invested in the $30 million national Stop it at the Start campaign. The idea behind this campaign is to educate people about the harmful anti-women attitudes that researchers have found are strong forces driving violence against women. These initiatives build on the $100 million Women's Safety Package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the people who make the greatest difference in the domestic violence space are those who work at the coalface. In my electorate there are two shelters for women fleeing domestic violence: there's the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Women's Shelter and there's The Sanctuaryâ€”The Hills Women's Shelter. I want to take this opportunity to commend the amazing people who work so hard in these facilities, who've dedicated their lives to protecting women and children from violence. Both shelters are part of the Women's Community Shelters network with their outstanding CEO, Annabelle Daniel, and my former constituent, Kris Neill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sanctuary opened in March 2016 through the hard work and determination of The Hills Shire community. The Sanctuary has a team of specialists who work 24-hours a day supporting people who are in a time of crisis in their lives. They have a child-focused case worker who is a specialist in dealing with childhood trauma. The Sanctuary is also one of the few shelters in New South Wales that can provide services for people with disability, as well as women with larger families. To date, 86 women and 154 children have gone through The Sanctuary. Ninety-five per cent of women and children who've gone there have transitioned away from violence; the sector norm is only 50 per cent. I commend the hardworking team at The Sanctuary and their board chair, Yvonne Keane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Women's Shelter has housed 267 people since it opened. They help people from a range of different cultures, religions and ages. The oldest person who sought refuge is a remarkable 83-year-old lady. The shelter deals predominantly with people facing domestic violence but also with people facing other issues like homelessness, and it regularly deals with more complex issues like mental health, addictions and medical issues. I want to commend the work of Sallianne McClelland, the president of the shelter, who is also the 2018 Hornsby Woman of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day women and children arrive in such shelters with bruises, black eyes, scars, cigarette burns, and breaks and fractures, and these amazing people take care of them and help them rebuild their lives. To those who work at the coalface every day, thank you for what you're doing. The government must also do more to augment the work of these shelters by providing more temporary accommodation for victims of domestic violence whose lives and safety can be uncertain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other people doing good work in the space of family break-up. I particularly want to commend Parents Beyond Breakup and both Dads in Distress and Mums in Distress. The groups work with parents who are struggling with family breakdown. I had a chance to visit a Dads in Distress group in my electorate run by Campbell Lennox and to see firsthand the work they do in sensibly navigating people through issues that confront them in the family law system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The experience of going through the Family Court is incredibly stressful. It often causes parents and children a lot of pain. It's becoming clearer to me that the adversarial system is not the right tool for managing most marriage breakdowns. I want to commend the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice of the Family Courtâ€”and I acknowledge in the chamber today the member for Corangamiteâ€”for the good work they've been doing to address these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I think it's also important to point out that, while women are most commonly the victims of domestic violence, many Australian men and boys also suffer violence at the hands of family members. It's important to break down a stigma and ensure that all sufferers of domestic violence are protected and that all family violence is equally condemned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of society is to civilise the basic human instincts, particularly that instinct to sort out conflict with violence rather than appeal to reason. In his famous documentary, <span style="font-style:italic;">Civilisation</span>, which aired 50 years ago on the BBC, the historian Kenneth Clark finished the series by making some comments on what the achievements of civilisation actually meant. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I believe that order is better than chaos, creation better than destruction. I prefer gentleness to violence, forgiveness to vendetta. On the whole I think that knowledge is preferable to ignorance, and I am sure that human sympathy is more valuable than ideology. I believe that in spite of the recent triumphs of science, men haven't changed much in the last two thousand years; and in consequence we must still try to learn from history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ I believe in courtesy, the ritual by which we avoid hurting other people's feelings by satisfying our own egos. And I think we should remember that we are part of a great whole. All living things are our brothers and sisters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only when we remember this as a society that we overcome those basic instincts which lead to domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Olga Edwards, to her broader family and to the community at West Pennant Hills, I offer the sympathy of our community and the national parliament on your unimaginable loss.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I grieve for the state of communications policy and regulation in Australia, which languished for almost five years under this current Prime Minister when he was Minister for Communications and under his hapless successor, Senator Mitch Fifield.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, Labor moved a motion of no-confidence in the Turnbull government. Labor has no confidence in this Prime Minister or his divided, dysfunctional and out-of-touch government. This Liberal-National government is in the depths of an identity crisis. They stand for nothing other than their own political survival. This is clearly demonstrated in the communications portfolio, as it is in other portfolios. In the communications portfolio, the Liberal-National government has made promise after promise to save their political skin, only to break these promises one by one. They promised their second-rate National Broadband Network would be delivered sooner, and it would be faster and cheaper. But it's slower, later and more expensive. It costs more and does less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They promised there would be no cuts to the ABC or SBS yet they've cut around half a billion dollars from public broadcasting. These savage cuts have seen jobs lost, services shut down and a reduction in Australian content. But it's not just the litany of broken promises; this Liberal-National government has failed to lay out a comprehensive vision for media and communications in Australia. They have had almost five years to come up with a plan for communications and they have failed to do so. They have failed because they have no principles, no conviction and no vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear that this government do not even believe in a national broadband network. On something as fundamental as ubiquitous high-speed broadband connectivity, this government do not even have a clear discourse on why we need it or what we're going to do with it. This government do not believe in public broadcasting. They attack the ABC and SBS at every turn with budget cuts, as well as with a raft of unnecessary and vindictive bills, reviews, inquiries and complaints. The attacks are financial and ideological. The Minister for Communications is a serial complainant to the ABC about its content and management affairs. The minister is a card carrying member of the IPA, a group that actually advocates privatising the ABC and SBS and, as it was recently revealed, the senator has even made a private donation to the IPA. What's more, earlier this year, the Liberal Federal Council went so far as to vote overwhelmingly to privatise the ABC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government do not believe in media diversity. Their biggest achievement in the name of media law reform has been to junk a key media diversity safeguard despite the fact Australia has one of the most concentrated media markets in the world and it's about to get a lot more concentrated. Rather than safeguard the public interest in media diversity in our democracy, this government did what they always do: they looked after the top end of town with the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule for cross-media control. But they didn't do it on merit. No. They had to scrape the votes in the Senate by doing all manner of backroom deals, including an attack on the ABC with Pauline Hanson's One Nation and the grant of a whopping $30 million of taxpayer fundsâ€”uncontested!â€”to Fox Sports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Turnbull government hasn't deliberately lied about or set to destroy, it has delayed and stymied with inaction. Take spectrum reforms, as one example. This is a sector estimated to be worth around $177 billion to the economy over 15 years. In May 2014 the then Minister for Communications announced a review of Australia's spectrum policy and management framework. So long ago was this announcement made that the link to the then minister's media release on the department's spectrum reform webpage takes you to the PANDORA archive. The release has been archived, just as it seems this current Prime Minister will soon be archived himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over four long years later, we have not had a bill to reform spectrum introduced into parliament for debate, let alone seen the release of the second exposure draft of the radiocommunications bill for consultation. The lack of drive and vision on spectrum reform is matched by this government's lacklustre approach to 5G. All this government has produced is a directions paper and yet another working group that doesn't even seem to report on its progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And take audio description on free-to-air television. In five long years this government has achieved nothing for blind and low-vision Australians who desperately seek audio description as a basic human right. This government's Audio Description Working Group has gone nowhere. The final report of that group was delivered in December last year, and still no action from government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the National Broadband Network. Back in 2013, the then communications minister, now the Prime Minister, promised to deliver the National Broadband Network for $29.5 billion, with the rollout to be completed by the end of 2016. He made this promise under the false pretence that switching to copper and HFC would be faster and cheaper. The results have been a debacle, absolutely mirroring his prime ministership. As it stands, his second-rate NBN is $20 billion over budget and four years behind schedule, symbolic of a Prime Minister who has failed every key policy test he has faced. It's not just bad political judgement that he's got; it's bad policy judgement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The multi-technology mix has not been faster or cheaper. It's slower and more expensive, it costs more to maintain and it generates less revenue. It delivers slower speeds. It's less reliable. It's more exposed to wireless competition. And consumers and taxpayers are worse off. All this because the former Prime Minister ordered the now Prime Minister to destroy the NBN, and he was too weak to say no. What a shambolic and dysfunctional lot this government are. They have no conception of the public interest, no guiding principles and no positive aspirations for how we use technology and connectivity to make this country a better place, to make Australians more included and to improve the quality of life for each Australian regardless of where they live or work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And not content with creating a digital divide with technology in the fixed-line footprint, the Liberals are now looking to create a digital divide based on price between city and country. Over the past 12 months we've seen household broadband prices come under pressure on a number of fronts. Firstly, under this government, NBN Co has set the same wholesale price for 12-, 25-, and 50-megabit per second plans. This has the effect of increasing entry-level broadband prices. Secondly, the government is seeking to introduce a $7-a-month broadband levy on non-NBN networks. Labor has made it clear that it considers the levy to be poorly designed, and the need to consider it in this parliament is highly regrettable. Labor will not oppose this levy outright, given the poor state of the economics of the multi-technology mix, but it's just another example of this government saying one thing and doing another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdlyâ€”and the most important thing I'd like to mention on this frontâ€”the step to increase pressure on broadband prices occurred last week. Last Wednesday, before a hearing of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, NBN admitted it planned to charge regional Australians on the fixed wireless network $20 more per month than a customer on the same speed who lives in the city. That is an extra $20 per month that regional consumers would have to fork out. Simply put, a regional Australian could pay 44 per cent more than someone in the city for the same speed of 50 megabits per second.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The morning after this revelation Labor held a press conference and called for the hike to be dropped, because the NBN was supposed to bridge the digital divide, not create a new one. It's notable that the ABC reported that after Labor's press conference NBN Co modified the online version of their opening statement to add a passage that did not exist in the original statement and was not said at the hearing. Within the space of 24 hours, the minister's claim that the regional broadband price hike was simply under consultation was falling apart at the seams. One thing is clear, Australians cannot afford another term of broken promises and ineptitude from the Liberals and the Nationals when it comes to the communications portfolio. They have no vision for Australia and no understanding of what is needed in this vital policy area.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I grieve for the farmers in my electorate of Farrer, who are struggling with the drought, with zero water allocations and with a lot of different issues and problems that sometimes seem to overwhelm them. However, we are a resilient bunch and we will come through this stronger and better than we were before. When I go into my electorate and meet and speak to farmers or call them from here or from my electorate offices in Albury and Griffith, I have to say I really do share their pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around my electorate, most graziers are continuing to bring in feed for livestock. To the north, where the extended dry spell has been around for much longer, some have been doing this for the last eight months. In contrast, an area such as Hay in the middle of my electorate has been feeding out for about a month. Most graziers are not qualifying for assistance as they're still getting good prices for their livestock and they will still make a profit this financial year. Prices to run the farm are jumping. Some graziers are ordering feed only to find that the cost of feed is increasing daily and that sometimes their orders have been resold to a higher bidder. Cotton growers are looking at the price of temporary water and assessing whether or not they will grow. The current price of temporary water is over $350 a megalitre, and that's bordering on not being profitable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst-affected areas are the dry cropping areas such as Hillston and Goolgowi in the Carrathool shire. There's also the flow-on effect from any rural and agricultural downturn to small businesses in towns and communities, something that we should never forget. In Finley, at the heart of the Murray irrigation area, all the dryland wheat is going to die unless it receives 20 to 25 millimetres in the next fortnight. The dryland canola is already a write off. Although more water is probably too late for the non-watered crops, it might help for irrigated rice, corn and cotton and for forage crops like millet and hay. The same producers warn that with water trading at a minimum of $350 to $360 per megalitre, buying water is becoming out of reach for most rice growers. In short, one of Australia most important domestic and export foods, if not its most important, is quickly becoming unviable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Blighty, which is close to Deniliquin, local farmer Mary Browne notes they are completely bewildered that environmental water could be pushed through the forests while they have zero watering allocation. She asks: 'Wouldn't it be far more beneficial to allocate the environmental water to our irrigators, whose only desire is to finish crops and have some return on their large expenditure? Two years ago we lost crops due to flooding and now we have crops floundering.' In Jerilderie, I've been talking to Martin Robertson, who says, 'We want to be part of a solution, but if we don't get water soon we'll be part of the problem.' That is a very telling remark, because most of the irrigated farmers that I represent are not looking for drought assistance. They are looking to complete their farming programs for winter and for summer. They absolutely hate having to come to government for assistance. It's not who they are. It's not how they were brought up. They understand that of course it's necessary from time to time, but they see that there are other options available for governments to support themâ€”and I've been talking now for two weeks about an 'environmental borrow' which would see environmental water in the storages in the Dartmouth and Hume dams allocated, on a 'borrow and pay back' basis, to irrigated farms in my electorate; thus giving them the water to stop the crops that I've just been talking about from dying in front of them but also guaranteeing that the environment gets that water back when it wants it. I've talked before about financial instruments in water that could make this possible. Irrigators would be prepared to underwrite the risk. We aren't talking about wanting something for nothing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest round of drought support, which was announced at the weekend by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, is very welcome. My electorate, in southern New South Wales, is mainly around the Murray and the Murrumbidgee rivers but also contains some western dryland areas. It is not as badly hit as the areas to the north. The Prime Minister was in Forbes on the weekend. It's not as bad as that, but obviously it's rapidly getting so. But that drought support is very welcome, and the government is delivering tax relief to help farmers invest in feed storage, which could help around 50,000 broadacre livestock and dairy farms. Fodder storage, such as liquid feed storage tanks, silos and bins for grain, and hay sheds and bunkers for silage, can now be deducted in one year rather than three. That's very welcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We learn a lot from every single drought. I think from this drought we've learnt of this national fodder scarcity. It's not something I've seen previously to the same degree. We have to ask ourselves the question: what could we do differently or do better? I was talking to my constituent Harold Clapham, from Deniliquin, who remembers on one of the FS Falkiner properties north of Deni in the 1950s they buried 10,000 acres for silage and, in the mid-1970s, dug that silage up and fed their soon-to-be-starving stock. Not one sheep left the property. So there was fodder conservation undertaken, and it worked really well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we tend to do now is encourage people, with a tax deduction, to hold money in cash, which doesn't really make all that much sense. I'm not against farm management depositsâ€”I think we should still keep themâ€”but I also think they're probably a lazy way of securing those variable returns back to farmers, particularly when you consider that, when you get them out, they have a tax implicationâ€”as they should. Wouldn't it be better if we really encouraged farmers to invest in fodder storage? That would mean in some way valuing bales of hay. If you keep fodder on your farm, the equipment to keep it there is tax deductible, but the fodder itself isn't. If it were, I think we would see farmers doing that much more than when we see them buying FMDs. I encourage the government to look very closely at that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to low-interest rate loans, the government is increasing the amount of money a farmer can borrow in a concessional loan from the Regional Investment Corporation from $1 million to $2 million. I've done the rounds of my drought counsellors and asked how useful these loans are. Unfortunately they're not very. What we are seeing is that loans are extended to farmers who have sufficient commercial viability not to go to a low-interest loan. I'm not saying it's not a good thing for them, but let's consider for a moment the young farmer having a go, with high debt and therefore reasonably low equity, who unfortunately fails the test from our big four banks and often misses out on such low-interest loansâ€”because the banks always make sure that everything is in their favour and they have to approve what you're doing. If you have any other lenders, they have to agree, and they all start tiptoeing around the issue. It doesn't work as well as it should, which is why, to begin with, many of these loans weren't taken up. Let's face it, the interest rate environment in Australia is not high, and knocking a couple of percentage points off a loan, while useful, probably isn't the best thing we could do around financial support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got four banks and they all behave exactly the same, as far as I am concerned. Sometimes they are goodâ€”and I like it when they areâ€”and sometimes they are bloody awful to farmers. What they could do is take the pressure off farmers by having a much earlier discussion about the penalties they apply when you can't make your payments in time. Interest rate penalties are terrifying for farmers. You go into a holding pattern and you don't have any income and then you look at your loan balance and it is suddenly beyond your control. Then the banks will say, 'We're going to leave that there,' and they do, so that you can sort of be constantly made anxious about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the millennium drought, in the western division of my electorate, which I represented for that whole 10 years, we paid a billion dollars in exceptional circumstances interest rate support to those farmers. Where did that $1 billion go? It went straight to those four banks. I remember meeting them once with the then agriculture minister, Peter McGauran, and saying to the banks, 'What are you going to do in return?' and the reply I got was, 'We'll look at everything on a case-by-case.' Really what they need to do is recognise that they are in it for the long haul with these farmers. Working capital has to be extended and penalty interest rates should not be imposed. If your farmer applies for a low-interest rate loan, don't demand excessive paperwork and please say yes. Look after the farmers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">1. The 250th Anniversary of Captain James Cook's first voyage to Australia and the Pacific will be held in 2020. The Australian Government is providing $48.7 million over four years from 2017-18 for a package of measures to commemorate the anniversary and allow Australians to mark this significant anniversary in a spirit of reflection that acknowledges the meeting of two cultures. This includes:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Â Â Â c. $2 million for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies to scope and commence activity relating to the repatriation of culturally significant items from overseas. Further commitments will be guided by the outcomes of the scoping exercise.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of the $25 million allocated to the Kamay Botany Bay National Park Master Plan, $2 million has been earmarked for a monument. The Australian Government contribution is being administered by the Department of the Environment and Energy. The Kamay Botany Bay National Park falls within the electorate of Cook, which is currently held by the Treasurer, the Hon Scott Morrison MP. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">2. The history of Cook's interactions with the Indigenous population of the east coast of Australia have been widely written about. These stories and many more will be an important part of the national dialogue surrounding the anniversary commemorations. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">4. Cook's interactions with Indigenous people along the east coast of Australia will be reflected in a variety of ways through the package of measures provided by the Australian Government. For example, the National Museum of Australia has received funding to stage an exhibition, which will represent the perspectives of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians about the voyage and its continuing and contested legacies today. It will do this by counterpointing the 'view from the ship' with the 'view from the shore'. Activities undertaken by other agencies in the portfolio will similarly explore the anniversary from a range of perspectives. </span>
