I seek your guidance. Senator Dean Smith introduced a formal motion, No. 831. The Deputy President was in the chair and passed it on the ayes. It was disputed, and she then asked if a division was required. There were two dissenting voices, and, amid some confusion, the chair actually put the question again. The dissenting voices were those of Senator Anning and Senator Burston. During the division, Senator Burston left the chamber. Standing order 100(2) states:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  Thank you, Senator Hinch. This matter was brought to my attention this morning. You correctly point out the requirements of standing order 100, subclauses (2) and (3). With respect to the vote held yesterday, yes, senators should remain in the chamber and are required to when they call for a division, and their vote is required to reflect their voice when the question was put. However, upon taking advice, I believe the result of the division would not have been any different. It is not an invalid division, but you correctly give us the opportunity to remind all senators that, when they call for a division, they must remain in the chamber, and their vote must reflect their voice call when the matter was first put. To do otherwise is a breach of standing orders. But the division is not invalidated by that, given the result would have been no different.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  When I left off my contribution last night, when the adjournment intervened, I was talking about how I would spend the $26 billion a year of tax cuts in the areas of my portfolio. I realise that other senators also have priorities for their portfolios, but I am focusing on my portfolios. I went through issues about Newstart, reparations for the stolen generations and making sure that we have adequate housing in remote communities. I'd also make sure that we were properly addressing redress for those affected by institutional sexual abuse and making sure the cap was $200,000, for example, instead of the $150,000 which was in the legislation that passed this place yesterday. I'd also make sure that we had adequate services in emergency departments for people suffering from a mental health crisis. I'd also make sure that grants for organisations delivering vital services in our communities were indexed so that community organisations weren't suffering a reduction every year in the funding and services they could provide. I'd make sure that Centrelink actually worked and that we had a functioning system where people actually answer the phone and calls are answered the first time people ring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We Greens would increase the minimum wage by 60 per cent. I reckon that's a much better way of spending the money this government is spending on these tax cuts. And, from the feedback that we have had, Australians would prefer that's the way the money was spent. They would prefer that we were delivering good, strong public services rather than funnelling this money to the big end of town. We need to address inequality in this country. We need a poverty plan, not a plan to make the wealthy even wealthier, which is what these tax cuts do. Most people won't benefit at all. The rich will get even richer. The fact is the majority of the benefits flow to the top 20 per cent of income earners. We have a plan to make the rich richer. We don't have a plan in this country to address poverty. Three million Australians are living in poverty and 3.6 million Australians do not have food security, according to the latest Foodbank report. We have people living in poverty, and the people that are most vulnerable are those trying to get by on the inadequate payment of Newstart and the youth allowance. We have people who are trying to survive below the poverty line, but the government's argument is: 'They're not really in poverty. The Anderson line and the poverty line are just an indication.' The research shows that there's a very good correlation between the poverty line and the expression of the poverty line as a measurement and the deprivation measures and deprivation structures. The research finds there's a good correlation between those in deprivation and where those poverty line measurements are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government likes to play fancy with words to imply that those on Newstart are doing relatively okay, thank you very much, because those poverty lines not a very good indication. But we know they are a good reflection of those suffering from various measures of deprivation, such as how often they've eaten, what they can buy to send their children to school with and whether their children are missing out on going to school because they don't have the necessary resources and supports to be at school. Those measures of deprivation are reflected well in the poverty line. The government also says, 'Those living on Newstart get other benefits.' But we know that, for the vast majority of those receiving the Newstart allowance, the main additional payment is the energy supplement, which is a whole four bucks a week. Hurray! They could go out and buy a cup of coffee. And that's the very measure that the government wants to take away and still has on the books to take away. In terms of the so-called supplementary income for income support payment recipients, as I've just said, the only payment received by the majority of people is the energy supplement, and we all know the government plans to cut that. Thirty-eight per cent of people receiving Newstart do receive rent assistance because they pay private rent. The maximum rate for single adults without children is $67 a week. In what we know is an unaffordable rental market, that goes very little way to being able to pay rent. Anglicare does a study every year about access to housing. From their recent study, we know that three properties out of 67,000 nationally were affordable for a single person on Newstart receiving rent assistance. So it is just a joke that the government thinks that rent assistance goes anywhere near addressing the need for affordable housing or making sure people aren't living below the poverty line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Salvation Army reported a couple of weeks ago that their latest study has found that, when you take out the cost of accommodation, those on Newstart have $17 a day to try and survive on. Again, I renew my challenge to those on the other side of the chamber to try living on Newstart, even for a week. A week gives you a taste of what it's like to try and survive on Newstart. Other additional payments, such as family tax benefit, are only received by 19 per cent of the people on Newstartâ€”again blowing a massive hole in the government's argument that those living on Newstart really aren't living below the poverty line and there's no need to increase Newstart. The family tax benefit is actually to help parents raise their children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is only one job available for every eight people looking for paid work. Two-thirds of people receiving Newstart are having to rely on the allowance for 12 months or more. When this payment originally came in, when we were calling it the dole and other previous names, it was about people being temporarily out of work for around six weeks, and people could survive on the payment for that length of time. That situation, of course, has changed. So many more people are having to rely on Newstart for much longer, work is not as readily available and there is much more active age discrimination against older workers trying to find work. And we all know the appalling statistics for young people who are unemployed. We used to talk about this affecting people in their early 20s. Now we're talking about those over 25 being unable to find permanent full-time work; they're more likely to be in temporary or part-time work. So our work situation is much more precarious than it used to be. People need to rely much more on income support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know living in poverty is a barrier to employment. We know that many people on Newstart have a number of vulnerabilities. Due to cuts from the Howard government, the Rudd-Gillard government and then the Abbott government, people with disability applying for the disability support pension have not been able to access it, and there's been an active push by this government, started by Mr Abbott and followed by Mr Turnbull, to try and kick more and more people off the disability support pension. Rather than enable them to remain on the disability support pension and improve their prospects of finding work, they are being actively assessed to kick them off the disability support pension. So they're living on the poorer payment of Newstart while they're trying to find work. This all adds up to a mess, where we have hundreds of thousands of Australians living below the poverty line while they are trying to survive on Newstart. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the way the government chose to index Newstart, it has not adequately kept pace with the true cost of living. It is not indexed the same as the age pension, so it has fallen further and further behind. The money that is being given away to the big end of town should be spent on those people that are living below the poverty line, that are trying to find work on Newstart, on youth allowance and on other payments. That's where we should be focusing that money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should invest in the services that support Australians, as I articulated earlier. We have a commitment in this country to universal service. The Greens are deeply committed to universality to ensure that we have a health system and an education system, and a social security safety net that truly is a social security safety net. That's where we should be spending the money that the government is giving away to the big end of town. As I said, the majority of it's going to the top 20 per cent of income earners. That money is not addressing inequality in this country; in fact, it will be driving inequality. Instead of focusing on those on the very lowest incomes, the government's saying, 'Big end of town, work on the trickle-down effect.' We in Western Australia know very well, from when we had the mining boom, that that money does not trickle down to those on the lowest incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember a little bit of history. I was in this place when John Howard decided before the 2007 election that he would hand out money hand over fist for tax cuts. Let's have a quick look at where that ended up. Mr Rudd came in and continued with those tax cuts. Then we had the GFC, but those tax cuts were in place. That largesse was still in place. Instead of spending that money on services that would have better supported those who would be most affected by the GFC or by a downturn from good economic times to bad economic times, those tax cuts were allowed to flow through. Then we got to Mr Abbott, who came in and slashed the social security safety netâ€”he absolutely slashed itâ€”and came up with a brilliant idea: 'Oh! We'll force young people to wait six months before they can access Newstart or youth allowance.' Fortunately, this Senate stopped that ridiculous plan. It would not support that ridiculous plan. The government also took half a billion dollars out of funding for Aboriginal services. This can be related directly back to the fact that they gave away all that money in tax cuts. Now we're seeing a slight increase in revenue, and the government rushes to give it away. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what does the ALP do? It wants tax cuts that are 'bigger, better and fairer'. I don't know where the ALP came up with the term 'fair' in terms of tax cuts, when they are not supporting an increase to the most vulnerable people in our community, those who are struggling on Newstart, on youth allowance, on the age pension and on disability support pension. Those are the people that we need to be supporting not only through an increase in Newstart and an increase in youth allowance but by making sure that we are addressing and supporting the services that really will make a difference in people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 10 richest families in Australia own as much wealth as the poorest four million Australians combined. Three million of those poorest Australians are living below the poverty line. As I said, 3.6 million, part of those four million, are suffering from food insecurity, and yet what does this government want to do? It wants to hand over more money to the wealthiest in this nation, to those earning the highest incomes. We Greens say no, that is not good enough. We need to make sure that we are funding Australians who need the support, and we do that by making sure that we can fund Newstart and youth allowance, that we can fund those most in need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How about we have a redress scheme for those children who were in institutional care but suffered other forms of abuse, such as physical and mental abuse, who still have not received reparations and who will not be able to access the counselling services under the National Redress Schemeâ€”limited though they are, because they're not lifelong services? How about a redress scheme for those survivors, for those care leavers? Many of them were brought to this country by our government, were subjected to abuse and have not received redress. How about spending some money on them? How about providing services that all the community wants?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you ask Australians if they want public services or tax cuts, they'll tell you they want public services. They want to make sure that they and their children can access a top-quality education system. They want to make sure that they can get health services when they need it. They want to be able to ring Centrelink and the Department of Human Services and get the information they want without having to keep dialling and dialling. They want a social security net for when they fall on hard times. I want to be able to look in the faces of people with disability and say that our country can provide them with the support and services they need, instead of demonising them and making them jump through all sorts of hoops, trying to find work for 18 months before they can access the disability support pension. That's not the country I want to live in. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  We've heard a lot from the government so far in this debate about their tax plan making things more fair; however, it's very clear to Australians, because they're fair-minded people, that there's nothing fair about the 2018 budget or about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. What most people think is fair in this nation is a greater sense of equity and equality. For example, when there are two people at a football match, and one can see over the fence and the other can't, it's not fair to keep them both standing on the ground; it's fair to give the short person a leg-up and put them on a box so they can see. That is the principle of progressive taxation. Fairness is about levelling the playing field for people.</span>

In this bill the flattening of the progressive nature of our tax system would give high-income earners in our country a much higher benefit than lower income earners. Here we have it again for all to see: high-income earners and big business are the true priorities of the Turnbull government. Under the proposal the government has put forward, 62 per cent of the benefits would go to higher income earners while just seven per cent would go to the 30 per cent of Australians on the lowest wages. Why would you do that? Are you insane? Do you not care about the working poor in our nation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill continues to demonstrate how out of touch this government is with the reality of Australians' lives and in particular the people doing it toughest. This bill also demonstrates a government that is prepared to risk the budget bottom lineâ€”our capacity to pay down debt, to pay for services, to have a good Defence Force and to bail ourselves out of bad timesâ€”so it can hand out tax cuts to big business and top-income earners while doing very little for middle-income households. Whilst those opposite will argue that they're flattening the tax system, making it fairer, and that lower income households are getting a tax cut, it's a much smaller tax cut in dollar terms than the one for those who are already substantially much better off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our current economic climate, we should have a government that's concerned about workforce participation, concerned about lack of wage growth and concerned about increasing the disposable income of targeted households as a way of boosting consumer spending. It's very clear that this government is not interested in that. What happens when you boost the incomes of higher income households? They invest more. They save more. These are worthy aspirations, but, when you put income into lower income households, they spend it and stimulate the economy, and everyone benefits. Investing more when you are on a higher income is all very well, except that people are accumulating wealth, in many instances, above and beyond that which ordinary Australians will ever be able to see or access in their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the coalition, we see the cost of living set to increase. Workers in the retail, food and accommodation industries are losing up to $77 a week in penalty rates. We see families and pensioners paying around $20 a week or more, or about $1,000 a year, for private health insurance. We see parents paying more for child careâ€”$40 a week, or $2,000 a year, more in fees. And we see record costs to visit a GPâ€”on average, about $9 more every time you visit a doctor. These are the reasons why Labor is very prepared to support the government's proposed changes that are set to take effect on 1 Julyâ€”those tax cuts that are targeted at people who need them. Labor will support tax cuts for 10 million people on 1 July, and we are ready to vote for those tax cuts today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor is elected, we want to double these tax cuts and make them permanent, while asking those in the top tax bracket to pay a little more to help reduce debt. People in the top tax bracket, relative to people in the lower tax brackets, still have the resources to pay for their accommodation and pay for their retirement. Labor's bigger, better, fairer income tax will see those earning up to $125,000 a year better off when compared to Malcolm Turnbull's plan for the next four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply absurd to us in the Labor Party that someone on $200,000 a year should pay the same tax rate as someone on $40,000 a year. It is unfair and absurd. So we don't agree with the Turnbull government giving more tax cuts for the top bracketâ€”and this is after the Turnbull government cut the tax rate for high-income earners just last year. The idea that a corporate executive or a politician on $200,000 a year should pay the same marginal tax rate as a worker earning close to the minimum wage, on a salary of about $41,000, strips away every shred of progressiveness in our taxation system. Yet, absurdly, this government is trying to pull the wool over Australians' eyesâ€”and I don't think they will fall for itâ€”to sell the idea that this is a tax cut for ordinary Australians. It's not a tax cut for teachers, police, cleaners or aged-care workers. It's a tax cut for the high end of town, for well-paid professionals, who will have a high standard of living relative to others without a tax cut. That's why Labor will move amendments in the Senate to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018 to ensure the passage of tax cuts starting on 1 July.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will seek to implement better, fairer tax cuts through Labor's tax refund for working Australians. This would double the tax relief up to $928 a year. It will mean that the 57,000 people in Canning, the 63,000 people in Forrest and the 65,000 people in Moore will receive an increased tax refund. However, what we've seen is the Turnbull government's tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit wealthier electorates. So it's not surprising to me that this government has seen tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit inner Melbourne and inner Sydney electorates, but it is of great concern and a disgrace that Mr Andrew Hastie and the Turnbull government are not standing up for the people of Canningâ€”the good, hardworking people of Mandurah, Pinjarra and Byford and all those across the Canning electorate. As I move around Canning, I talk to constituents about their struggle to make ends meet and the fact that they juggle numerous jobs just to earn a modest income. They will tell you how they're overworked and underpaid or struggling to find enough work to get by. People who are struggling to find enough work to get by deserve a better, bigger tax cut than the high end of town because they rely on every cent of what they earn just to get by. There's no rational reason to take the same amount of tax out of their income as is taken out of my or your much higher incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see that up to 70 per cent of taxpayers will be better off under Labor's fairer tax plan, and that includes 57,000 residents who live in Canning. Seventy per cent of the hardworking taxpayers in Mandurah, Pinjarra and Byford will be better off under our tax plan. And I suppose the Prime Minister does try to help, in his own way, when he says, 'They should just get a better job.' Try telling that to every single cleaner, storeperson, shop assistant, orderly, retail worker or hospitality worker. We need people to do these jobs. We need them to have incomes that keep those industries viable. They need good wages. We need to see wages growth in those industries. We know those industries will never see wages growth that compares with wages growth for high-paid professionals, but we need them to do those jobs. Why do you rub people's faces in their own professions in that way? We have to value the work that Australians do, because it needs to be done. Every day, in our communities and in our cities, we depend on the great diversity of work that people do, be it well paid or low paid. People on low wages should get better pay, but the simple fact is, because they are on lower wages and we need people to do that work, we should not, in our right mind, ever consider taxing them at the same rate as wealthier Australians. The absurdity of it is absolutely disgusting.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our nation, inequality is at a 70-year high. We should be taking steps to do exactly the opposite of what the government is doing, and that is taking steps to improve and address inequality and to remove inequality in our system by using our tax and transfer system and implementing principles that are exactly the opposite of what this government is seeking to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With overall inequality worsening, there are negative impacts on our economic growth. The best thing we can do to fix that is to have a strong, progressive taxation system where those who can afford to pay more do pay more and those who can't afford to pay as much aren't asked to pay as much. We need a government that stops standing in the way of tax relief for the 10 million Australians who need it. We need a more progressive taxation system, not a less progressive one. Tax cuts this year for teachers and tradies should not be held hostage to tax cuts for bankers or highly-paid professionals in six years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's priority is for tax cuts for big business and high income earners, at a stupendous cost of $25 billion a year in 10 years time. I don't think our nation can afford thatâ€”our schools and hospitals can't afford it, our TAFE system can't afford it, our social services can't afford it, our public sector can't afford it and our defence force can't afford it. The fabric that holds our community together simply cannot afford it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, on the other hand, because we're not giving millionaires another tax cut and we're not giving big business an $80 billion tax handout, can put more money into the pockets of working Australians while funding better schools and hospitals and paying down debt quicker. This bill will make our tax system in Australia less progressive and it will continue to erode our tax base. It doesn't deserve the paper it's written on.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  I rise today to contribute to this debate on a tax cut for millionaires, put forward, of course, by the Turnbull government. The whole essence of this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill rests on what types of priorities we have in this place and on what types of priorities we have for the nation. On one side we have the Turnbull government wanting to spend hundreds of billions of dollarsâ€”taxpayers' moneyâ€”in tax cuts for the big end of town, in addition to the tax cuts they've already flagged and have tried to push through this place already in relation to corporate Australia and the big banks. Malcolm Turnbull's priority is to look after the big end of townâ€”to look after the corporates, the big banks and rich, wealthy Australians. Meanwhile, everybody else is going to cop a cut in access to public services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the choice here. It's about priorities. Malcolm Turnbull wants to fund the billionaires and the big banks but those of us trying to stop these tax cuts from going through are asking: 'What happens when regular Australians need to go to hospital? What happens when someone's kid is sick? What happens when you rock up to school and you realise your public school is charging families school fees up to $4,000 to send their children to public schools, because we don't have money for the education system? What happens when a mother can't go back to work because childcare is too expensive?' These are the choices that we are being presented with in this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can only spend and invest money based on what it collects. We know that we don't just have a tax problem here. We have a problem with collecting the right amount of tax, because tax avoidance in this country, particularly from the big end of town, is rife. If you're a big corporate bank and if you're in corporate Australia, you can find many, many ways to reduce your taxable income. If you're a rich Australian, you can find the best accountant in the country to make sure you pay no tax at all. Meanwhile, average Australians are struggling day by day, and they rely on public essential services right around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you collect less tax as a government, you're going to have less money to spend on public services. If we have less revenue, that fundamentally undermines the ability of governments to do what they need to do, and that is to underpin essential services that are available to everybodyâ€”schools, hospitals and the broader health systemâ€”and to ensure that, if you lose your job and you're on unemployment benefits, Newstart payments are enough to live on so you can be supported until you get another job, not punished by living on less than $40 a day just because this government wants to prioritise giving millionaires $7,000 back. That's what's on the table here. Someone on an average income is perhaps, if they're lucky, going to get around $200 in a tax cut. And yet the wealthy Australians, the millionaires and, in fact, the politiciansâ€”those of us in this placeâ€”will get $7,000 out of this. That must be pretty galling to people out there listening to this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're told by the neoliberals on the other side that, despite being a wealthy nation, we can't afford things like proper funding of hospitals, or to ensure our elderly are taken care of in their aged-care homes, or for schools to be funded properly so parents don't have to fork out thousands of dollars just to send their kid to a public school. We're told we can't afford these things, and yet hundreds of billions of dollars in this package today are going to roll out the door in election bribes by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The neoliberals on the other side have done a very good job at trying to hoodwink the Australian people. Although we are a very wealthy country, the neoliberals have done everything they can to undermine and run public essential services into the ground. They want to give people a false choice: you can choose between Malcolm Turnbull's handout to millionaires or you can choose to fund public services. Spending, of course, is all about priorities, so is revenue and so is where we collect our revenue from. This government finds many, many ways to undermine the bare collection of revenue, because they don't want to upset their big mates in the banks, in corporate Australia or, indeed, in the rich end of town. This government says to average Australians and those who are struggling living on the median wage: 'We can't afford to help you, if you fall through the cracks. It's 40 bucks a day from Newstart if you lose your job. Suck it up.' No. That is not a choice we should be forcing Australians to make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you turn up to university in this country, you should be able to access a good-quality education, regardless of how much money is in your parents' bank account and regardless of what private or public school you may have attended. We need more young people, not fewer, being able to access good-quality higher education, whether it's through universities or the TAFE sector. That means we have to fund education properly. We have to make it available and accessible for all, not just for those whose parents are on the top of the rich list and are going to bank a $7,000 tax cut out of this and their kids will be okay. We need all Australian children to access good-quality education and know from a very early age that if they want to go on to university or TAFE they'll be supported in doing so. We should make that a guarantee. Every Australian child should know that if they want to get a higher education they can get one; they shouldn't have to be in the top income bracket to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what making government spending priorities is all about. Australians overwhelmingly know that the trade-off, or the dividend, of paying their taxes should be good quality public services. Australians don't mind paying tax if it means having good quality schools and being able to access the emergency ward in the hospital if someone falls over and breaks their hip or if a child is sick in the middle of the night. Australians don't mind paying taxes if they know that they're going to go to a well-funded NDIS. Australians don't mind paying their taxes if they're going to have a strong Medicare safety net. Australians know that being part of a decent democratic society is all about having the people who can afford to pay a bit more pay a bit more so that those who are struggling can be helped to get back on their feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A progressive taxation system is essential for the fair and decent society that we are all proud to live in here in Australia. That is under attack from this legislation and agenda of the government because all they care about is looking after the big banks, the rich end of town and Malcolm Turnbull's mates. If the Prime Minister really cared about productivity growth in this country, he'd fund child care properly so that more women were actively supported to go back to work. But what we will see come 2 July is a bunch of families losing access to their childcare support, particularly those families where both parents struggle to be in the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absolute lunacy of this tax bill is that it spends hundreds of billions of dollars as an election bribe, yet the majority of Australians who work hard every day and those who struggle to get into the workforce, those on unemployment benefits, really get nothing from this. No wonder Malcolm Turnbull's mates want this to pass, because they're going to bank $7,000 from it. Meanwhile, average Australians and the rest of the country will lose out because hospital waiting lists will grow, because school fees will rise and because our older Australians will continue to suffer in old aged-care homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at my home state of South Australia. We know that the overwhelming majority of the tax cuts outlined in this bill are going to go to those who are already the most well-off, those who are earning well above $120,000 a year. That's about five per cent of South Australians. So five per cent of South Australians might get something out of this, but 95 per cent of South Australians will get very little. In fact, there will be a double whammy because our state relies significantly on well-funded essential public services. As a result of this priority choice by this government to fund the rich and cut services most South Australians will lose out. By the time the full impact of these tax cuts is realised, South Australia will be losing around $2 billion from essential servicesâ€”that's cuts to schools, that's cuts to hospitals and that's cuts to other essential services. Bad luck if you need to put your kid in child care so that you can take an extra day of work a week. You won't be able to afford it, because the Turnbull government isn't going to be able to fund child care in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our universities and TAFEs are going to lose funding. They'll be $105 million worse off. We'll lose $305 million in spending on hospitals and health care. We can't afford that. We have an ageing population, particularly in South Australia, and we want to make sure our older Australians are looked after with dignity and with care. Yet the government is going to slash $305 million in funding used to support essential health care in South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll lose $905 million on pensions and payments, and this is a very clear message to the people of Mayoâ€”those South Australians who live in the Adelaide Hills and down along the Fleurieu Peninsula down to Victor Harbor. This tax cut for Malcolm Turnbull's mates is going to cost age pensioners and other recipients of government funding almost a billion dollars! How are we going to look after our aged and elderly Australians if we don't have the money to fund it? But who will be laughing? It'll be Malcolm Turnbull's mates, who are banking $7,000 a year. I guess that's a nice overseas holiday. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says: 'Look, don't worry about it. Everyone'll be paying less tax.' The reality is most Australians rely on public services to ensure that we can get through our daily lives. We all respect our well-funded public hospitals and health system. We all know that we need a public education system to ensure that there is a proper safety net, to ensure that our kids can go to school and get a good education, regardless of whether their parents have a job at the time or how much money their parents have in their bank account. In South Australia, these tax cuts mean that for every dollar that is given in a tax cut, South Australians are going to lose $1.40 in public services. On anyone's maths, that's a lose-lose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia loses massively in this bill, and that's a message I have for the members of Centre Alliance here today. Don't buy this government furphy. You've got a choice here: tax cuts for millionaires and Malcolm Turnbull's mates, or funding for South Australian schools, hospitals and services. As one of the smaller states and as one of the states with the lowest number of high-income earners in the country, South Australia loses out significantly under this bill. As a South Australian senator, I'm standing here today to say: do not risk it. Do not buy the furphy that you have to hand politicians a $7,000 tax cut in order to make everybody else feel okay. We don't need the $7,000 tax cut. What we need is more money for schools, more money to cut hospital waiting lists, and more money to ensure that working mums and dads in the electorate of Mayo actually can access well-funded child care. That's what we want the government to prioritise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Centre Alliance members in this place today: don't buy the lie that you should just tick this tax cut through. Does anyone really believe that if we start giving tax cuts to the big end of town, to politicians, to Malcolm Turnbull's millionaire matesâ€”</span>

This gives money to the richest and wealthiest Australians at the expense of funding for the age pension and funding for hospitals. This final stage of the tax cut does absolutely nothing for 60 per cent of taxpayers in this country. We have Senator Hanson snuggling up to the government again, selling out the majority of Australiansâ€”all of her votersâ€”to tick off on what is going to be the biggest tax cut given to millionaires in a long, long time. Senator Pauline Hanson is going to vote for this bill to give herself a $7,000 tax cut! What a grub! What a sneaky, sneaky move! What a sellout!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I too rise to put my remarks on the record with regard to this very important proposed piece of legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. This bill has the potential to have a significant and profoundly negative impact on Australians, as it is constructed by this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find that we hear once moreâ€”in the throes of the drama and intensity of these last two weeks of sitting before we go to another breakâ€”the government saying: 'This has got to be done now. This has got to get sorted now. On 1 July, the whole world's going to fall apart unless we get this resolved.' The pressure, right now, as I am making this contribution to the debate, is being applied to the crossbench, some of whomâ€”or their advisersâ€”I hope might be listening to my contribution. I want to point out how important it is that everyone understands that the Treasurer himself has conceded that the legislation does not need to be in place by 1 July for the tax relief that's being discussed to be received by the end of next financial year. That's the reality. This pressure cooker that's being created is an artifice. In this hastily constructed pressure cooker, we shouldn't be making decisions that would affect people six or seven years hence with such negative consequences, in my view, for our economy and, more profoundly, for our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're being faced with a choice by this government, with its litany of failures in service provision, between continuing along the path that it has set of taking away more and more services from Australians and throwing money, a little bit of money, at those who need it most and extraordinary sums at people on $200,000, who are not clamouring at the doors of this place saying: 'Give me $7,000. I can't survive without it.' That is not the challenge that is facing us in this parliament. The challenge is people clamouring at our doors, day in, day out, asking for the funding of basic services. There are over 100,000 Australians right now who are seeking aged-care packages. They're desperate for some help in their home so they can stay there. They're desperately in need. I see Senator Brown has joined us in the chamber here. People are trying to get decent services for disability needs. People are speaking to me in my role as the assistant shadow minister for mental health, despairing about suicide in their community and being unable to access services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the landscape: the service deprivation that has been imposed upon this nation by this government over five years of ripping money out of the services that Australians should have a right to expect. And having done that now, its grand plan, in addition to having abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility and budgetary constraint, is to try and buy off Australians by throwing some tax money at them in an entirely inappropriate and unfair way. That's why Labor will oppose the way in which this government wants to advance tax reform in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgetary decisions are all about choices, and Labor is going to choose services for all and tax cuts for those who need it most. It contrasts profoundly with the government's proposal of giving tax cuts of a shape and form that six years from nowâ€”when kids in year 7 have finished high schoolâ€”in 2024 will deliver a tax structure where 80 per cent of the benefit will flow to the top 20 per cent of wage earners in this country. If I only repeated that fact over and over and over in my contribution, if only that single fact could seep into the conversation about this proposed tax reform by the government, Australians would understand what a dog they're being sold and how cruel and unfair this government's proposal is. The bottom 60 per cent of all workers will get no tax benefit at all by 2024, if this government's bill passes as it is. That's the shape and form of what we're discussing here and why the debate that we're having is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's Personal Income Tax Plan demonstrates exactly how out of touch this government is. We as the Labor Party do not support someone on $200,000, which is the standard pay for most of the people who work in this parliament, paying the same tax rate as someone on $40,000. That is plainly unfair. We've seen this over and over in the course of this Liberal-National Party government with the prioritising of the top end of town over ordinary Australians; the prioritising in terms of tax where the cost is not just a lack of income benefit to low- and middle-income earners but the ongoing removal of services and the ongoing cuts to services absolutely across the horizon, if it gets this piece of legislation through. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to have a little bit of a look at a distributional analysis. If we look at the impact of this government's decisions, we can see that it has failed to provide any form of a distribution analysis of its Personal Income Tax Plan. But Labor and interest groups have, and it's very clear that stages 2 and 3 of the proposed tax reform by this government absolutely and totally fail the fairness test. Let's be absolutely clear here: stages 2 and 3 of the government's tax plan will flatten out Australia's personal income tax system, and that structural change to the personal income tax system is eroding its progressivity. This is a fundamental principle of our tax system, and it's based on the premise that, if you earn a small amount of income, pretty well everything that you earn goes to keeping a roof over your head, providing food, providing shelter and providing for the basics, but as you go up the tax scale, with those things accommodated, there is an increase in your capacity to contribute to the general wellbeing of the community and to pay a bit more tax so that we have decent hospitals and schools that are properly funded, where parents can send their children through the gates of any school in the country and know that there'll be readers for the kindergarten kids to read from and paper and resources for teachers to creatively engage with young people in high school. We trust that our tax dollars, invested on a slightly higher scale by those with a bigger income, benefit our entire community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you from this morning, when I was at the Kids' Cancer Project breakfast, that no-one in that room thinks there's adequate funding going into the prevention and treatment of cancer for young people. They were there asking the government, the opposition and anybody who would listen to hear their pleas for further investment in proper research capacity. The reality that we face right at this moment in our country is a choice between Labor and a Liberal government who have no commitment to decency, to fairness or to equity. The attempt to force this inequitable piece of legislation through the chamber should be abandoned.</span>

Whatever you receive at the moment, whether it be an education in a public school, treatment in a public hospital, using public transport or, indeed, some sort of family assistance payment, it's too much. You're already getting too much, because what the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018 does is strip away vital public revenue from those essential services.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, more than most of the other bills that come through this place, is going to help determine what sort of country we want to create. We've got some big choices ahead of us: we can choose to continue down the path of the Liberal and National parties to a dog-eat-dog world where everyone's in it for themselves and we shrink public services, or we can create a different sort of world, where we collectively come together, understand that we're in this together, invest in our people and ensure that no person languishes for months on a waiting list and that every young child gets access to the best possible education they can getâ€”a world where we have publicly owned infrastructure that provides all of the vital services that people need and where we have a strong social safety net so that no-one's left behind. That's the sort of future we can create. It's not a utopian dream; it's actually within our grasp here. It's just about the choices that we make in this chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been told by politicians of all stripes for more than a decade that Australia can't afford to do these thingsâ€”that we can't afford to increase Newstart, tackle climate change or protect the threatened species that exist in this continent and are disappearing at an alarming rate. In fact, we're going to do worse; we're going to cut the jobs of the people responsible for looking after the precious biodiversity in this island continent of ours. And we're now hearing a debate where the premise seems to be, 'My tax cut's bigger than your tax cut.' Some $144 billion is going to be taken out of public services. We're told that the reason for this change is to address bracket creep, yet wages are at an all-time low. This bill's not about bracket creep. It's about shrinking the size of government and the public services that follow from that, and it's about making sure that people who need a little bit of help don't get that help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got some choices ahead of us. We know that healthcare costs are increasing. We know that our education system needs more support. We know that our infrastructure is failing. We can afford to invest in all of those things. We could have a world-class public health system so that no person in this country languishes on a public waiting list. We could make sure that every child in the country gets access to a world-class education and, indeed, that those people who choose to send their child to a public school don't have to spend a cent out of their own pocket. We could build cities and regions that create no net pollution. We could preserve our planet for future generations to enjoy while they prosper. We can start restoring our environment, rather than destroying it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And at the heart of this debate is a lie. We're told that income taxes are too high, but the reality is very, very different. Australia is, by all indicators, a low-taxing country. When you consider our total tax take as a proportion of GDP compared to other similar OECD countries, we do very well. We're a low-taxing country. Yet we're told again that we have to reduce taxes, and the consequences of that are alarming. Our Public Service is already so badly decimated that it can't answer the phone when you call to find out why it's cancelled your pension or a family assistance payment. Past governments have spent the last two decades privatising government. We've got big corporates enjoying all of the upsides and everyday people getting stuck with all of the downsides. You only need to look at the announcement today from Telstra. Do you remember when Telstra was privatised? 'Better services. People will be looked after. We're going to save money.' There are 8,000 people today who don't know how they're going to be able to put food on their table. Yet we've got no-one in this place who's got the political courage to stand up and say: 'We don't need tax cuts. We need investment in services. We need to look after people. We need to raise Newstart. We need to start protecting our environment.' No-one has had the courage to stand up and do that apart from my colleagues in the Greens, and I want to thank each and every one of them for it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are financially reckless tax cuts. They're going to punch a $23 billion hole in the budget annually. If you look at stage 3 alone, they're going to grow by 12 per cent each year. It's completely unsustainable. We can't afford it. We know what the costs are. And we all know that, when it comes to issues like global warming, housing, student debt or work security, it's not going to be the people in this chamber who are going to have to deal with those issues; it's going to be the generations that come after us. It's going to be young people today who are going to be lumbered with the costs of this decision that we make in this chamber. We know that these tax cuts are a prescription for turbocharging inequality in Australia. When stage 3 kicks in, someone on the minimum wage will be paying the same rate as a bank executive or a politician. That's not a progressive tax system. It's taking us down the US route.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, like the Turnbull cabinet itself, the big winners are men, and women get a few scraps, with less than one-third of the top-end tax cuts. We've seen some analysis today from Professor Miranda Stewart at ANU, who has added more evidence of just how discriminatory against women these tax cuts are. You have to be working full time to get the benefit, yet 45 per cent of women work part time. For men, it's only 16 per cent. And 61 per cent of women caring for a child under the age of five are working part time, while for men it's only eight per cent. If you look at the interaction between these tax cuts and the new childcare payment starting next month, the research shows that a mother wanting to work a few extra days would get to keep just $4,000 if she earnt $27,000 in additional income. If you're a young mother not earning a high wage, you face an effective marginal tax rate of between 85 per cent and 95 per cent. Professor Stewart's conclusion is that we'd be better off investing the tax cut money into universal child care. Now there's a ripping idea which benefits women so they can live the lives they want to lead and doesn't hand out tax cuts which largely benefit men.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Treasurer's been deceptive in selling the benefits of this tax cut to senators and the public: $82,000 isn't the normal wage; it's the average salary of a full-time working bloke. The median wage of all Australians is around $54,000. Under even stage 1 of this tax cut, you can be a family with a combined income of just under $250,000 and you'll get a tax cut. The benchmark that the government's using, of a regular worker on 82 grand, is only a quarter of the workforce. Three-quarters of the workforce earn less than that. This plan's too focused on wealthy Australians. It does nothing for ordinary people. I reckon that if the majority of Australiansâ€”by definition, those earning less than $54,001, so, anyone under the median wageâ€”knew they were getting nothing in exchange for having their local schools and hospitals completely gutted, people in this place might reconsider. Let me be clear about that: there will be a few dollars a week in the pocket of somebody who's a childcare worker, a nurse or a teacher and, under stage 3 of this plan, an extra $7,000 for CEOs, politicians and bank executives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does nothing to address the concerns of the most vulnerable people in our community. People on Newstart or on a pension get nothing out of this billâ€”not a cent. If you're somebody who can't afford to take out private health insurance to jump a queue and you're languishing on a waiting list for a year to have your hip replaced, you get nothing out of this; in fact, you'll be waiting for longer, because every cent of this money that's spent on giving out a big tax cut is a cent not spent on cutting waiting lists. If you're somebody languishing in an emergency department for half a day to be seen, you get nothing out of this tax cut; in fact, you'll be waiting for longer. If you're a family who sends their child to a public school and are noticing that those out-of-pocket costs are growing each year, they will continue to grow, at a faster rate, because every cent that goes into the pocket of somebody on a high income is a cent that's not invested in our public schools. It does nothing for mums re-entering the workforce for one or two days a week. It does nothing for a carer who is looking after their elderly parents and can just fit in a few days a week of work. It does nothing for the lowest 40 per cent, but this bill does everything for the investment banker, for the politician, for the CEO and for the partner in a law firm helping their clients to avoid paying taxes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got choices to make. If we want to have tax reform in this country, let's start talking about the real problems that we face. We don't have a tax system; we have a tax avoidance system. Let's start talking about the tax reform that's necessary to close those loopholes that mean the wealthiest Australians and corporations aren't paying their fair share at the moment. Let's introduce a Buffett rule which says to people, 'It doesn't matter whether you've got the fanciest accountants and lawyers in the world; you will be paying a minimum of 30 per cent tax on every cent over $300,000.' Let's look at reforming our tax system. Let's have a PRRT that means that those oil and gas companies, who are currently ripping out Australian resources and not paying a cent of tax on them, start paying for Australian resources, for the things that we all own. Let's make sure that miners who are not paying a cent of excise on the diesel that they use start paying that. If it's good enough for every Australian in the country when they go to the bowser to have to pay a diesel excise, why isn't it good enough for our mining companies? Let's do something about multinational tax avoidance. Let's stop the practice of those big companies lending themselves money from offshore tax havens. Let's make sure we close that loophole by introducing worldwide gearing ratios. There's so much that we could be doing right now to close the loopholes to ensure that the wealthiest Australians, those corporations that aren't paying their fair share right now, pay their fair share, and we wouldn't be having a debate about stripping money away from our schools and our hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Greens believe unashamedly that now is not the time for income tax cuts. We believe that a decent society is founded on how we look after the most vulnerable people, those people who are struggling, which is why we've made a strong case for increasing Newstart. And we've heard nothing from the government or, indeed, from the Labor Party on that. We don't need a review into Newstart; we need to increase it. Let's make sure that as a nation that is losing biodiversity at a rate greater than almost any other nation on earth we start putting into practice some of the things that we know can help us protect our iconic Australian animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose this retrograde package in its entirety because we believe this is going to fundamentally reshape Australian society. This is a nation founded on the notion of egalitarianism, of a fair go, and there's nothing fair about this tax package. When economic inequality is already at dire levels, this is a prescription for turbocharging inequality in Australia. It will leave our schools, our hospitals and our public infrastructure to wither on the vine and it will make Australia a less equal society. It's not a future for this country that I want to see. It's not a future for this country that my colleagues want to see. That's why when this bill comes before this Senate we will be opposing each and every element of it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  No-one can say that One Nation is responsible for the passage or the fall of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. Everyone in this chamber carries that responsibility. I would like to see families, those hardworking Australians, and resident companies pay less tax, but the question is: can we afford it? The government says we can afford $140 billion of personal tax cuts and $60 billion of company tax cuts over a 10-year period, which means the cost to the revenue base is $20 billion a year, or seven per cent of the income tax base. The government has no plans to reduce wasteful spending, so how will the $20 billion shortfall in taxation income be made up?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last financial year, high commodity prices, particularly for iron ore and coal, led to the surprise increase of 22Â½ per cent in company income tax receipts. The government says these additional taxes are sustainable income in the long term, even though commodity prices go through a boom-and-bust cycle. The government has made a large number of assumptions about future income that in my view are not realistic, and a never-ending commodity boom is but one of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to whether the tax cuts proposed by the government, both personal and corporate, are affordable. If they prove not to be affordable then we will see a dramatic decline in frontline services or an increased national debt. It is no accident that in an election year the government wants to rain money down on citizens in the form of tax cuts. There are five by-elections coming up in July and there will be a general election in the next 12 months. In stage 1 of the proposed personal tax cuts, the government promises $10 a week in the form of a tax offset. Labor say $10 a week is an insult. They will up the bid for your vote to nearly $20 a week, but these tax offsets end in four years. A by-election in the electorate of Longman, in Queensland, will take place in July. The citizens of Longman paid $784 million in income tax to the federal government in 2015-16. These taxpayers paid more in income tax than 80 per cent of multinational companies and their Australian subsidiaries, but still the government says we do not have a revenue hole created by multinationals not paying a fair share of tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past 20 years we have had both Labor and Liberal national governments, and neither party has had the wit or the will to do anything to fill the revenue hole created by foreign-owned companies and their wholly owned subsidiaries. How can the government say there is not a revenue problem when 39 fossil fuel companies operating in Australia pay no tax, and they include our biggest electricity providers, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia? The two major parties want to tell you they are different, but when it comes to getting multinational companies to pay tax in Australia they are one. We estimate the revenue hole left by non-resident foreign companies operating in Australia to be big enough to pay for the government's proposed tax cuts for individuals and companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about getting multinationals to pay tax in Australia, Labor is like the scarecrow with no brains and the Liberals are like the tin man with no heart, walking down the yellow brick road in search of everything they lack, which is why so many voters give their vote to a minor party. Around 25 per cent of votes are given to minor parties, which reflects the disconnect between the major parties and what concerns Australians. The majority of Australians do not want population growth driven by high levels of immigration and they do not want to pay more tax than they should. The big four banks in Australia pay 25 per cent more income tax than all the multinational companies and their subsidiaries operating in Australia. The biggest corporate taxpayers in Australia are banks and resource companies. The Commonwealth Bank paid $3.3 billion, followed by Westpac, with $3 billion, and NAB, $2.4 billion. ANZ paid $2 billion. The highest amount of tax paid by a multinational was $386 million. How on earth can the government say there is no problem with the conduct of multinationals and their subsidiaries in Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If citizens want a more equitable and fairer society, then multinationals have to pay their fair share of tax, and citizens need to communicate that at the ballot box when they cast their vote. A vote for the One Nation candidate in Longman is a vote for a change in dealing with multinationals, who expect to pay nothing for all the things that allow them to operate profitably in Australia. Voters in every by-election need to tell politicians that being asleep at the wheel on multinational tax is not good enough, and the best way is to give your vote and your preferences to candidates who say they have a viable plan. The average Longman taxpayer paid $12,000 in income tax in 2015-16, while 26 per cent of multinational subsidiaries operating in Australia paid nothing. The list, of 145, includes Chevron Australia Holdings; ExxonMobil Australia; Puma Energy, who operate petrol stations across Queensland; American Express; and Vodafone Hutchison Australia. There is not time to read out the full list, because it is a long list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The length of the list of multinationals not paying tax in Australia should be a matter of shame to the government and the previous Labor government. I have been talking about non-resident companies failing to pay their tax for over 20 years. I am sick of hearing that the ATO has all the laws and staff it needs, because self-evidently that cannot be the case when fossil fuel companies pay more in political donations than they do in tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been talking to the government about budget repair since I became a senator. I have told the government at every opportunity that they need to get multinationals and their wholly owned subsidiaries to contribute to the income tax base. I have strongly advocated for reform of the gas taxation system, but the government is not interested. All I can do is make Australians aware of the facts and let them decide whether it is an issue that will help decide which candidate receives their vote. One Nation's policy on multinational tax reform and reform of the gas taxation system is well documented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pleasing to hear now that Senator Di Natale, in his comments today about taxes and multinationals not paying their taxes, has clearly been listening to my comments in the chamber for the last two years and has now picked it up and is running with it, the same as he did with the Australians building the rail line in Queensland to do with the Adani mine. So it's good to hear that he's actually been listening to me and taking up this case.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I supported company tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million, but I will not support further tax cuts for businesses until the government acts to repair the budget through a new tax base from multinational companies. I find myself in a dilemma over whether or not to support the government's Personal Income Tax Plan, which costs more than the extension of the company tax cut plan. I do not understand why the government is so reluctant to fund tax cuts with a new tax base created by getting multinationals and their wholly owned subsidiaries to pay their fair share of tax. I do not understand why the government's plan for personal income tax cuts is so complex.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In stage 1, the tax offset of $520 ends in four years and becomes a tax offset for those on very low incomes. In stage 2, effective in four years time, the threshold amounts in different brackets change. In stage 3, effective in six years time, one tax bracket disappears and the tax rates change. Once the second reading speeches are finished, the Senate will go into committee to debate amendments to this complex legislation. The government does not want to split the three stages of personal tax cuts even though there is broad support for stage 1, starting on 1 July 2018. Tomorrow, senators will be asked to undertake a difficult process not dissimilar to comparing mobile telephone plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's failure to split the bill into three stages creates a dilemma for me because stage 3 starts in six years time and no-one can predict whether we will be able to afford tax cuts legislated now. My dilemma is that I know Australians are doing it tough. Wage growth is very low. Certain cost-of-living items are rising much faster than wages. People are struggling to pay electricity bills. They manage by going without adequate heating or cooling when needed. Electricity bills are the No. 1 cost-of-living concern for Australians, and that is a tragedy in a country rich in gas and coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has come to see me this week to seek support for their position, which is to support stage 1 of the personal tax cuts while increasing the tax offset. Labor tells me that stage 2 of the personal tax cuts should not be supported, because a threshold move will give those on $90,000 to $120,000 a windfall of $1,350 and later, in stage 3, those on $200,000 tax relief of up to $7,000. Do I need to remind Labor that tens of thousands of electricians, plumbers, nurses, secondary school teachers, lift mechanics and welders earn more than $90,000 and will miss out on a permanent tax cut if Labor opposes stage 2 of the proposed Personal Income Tax Plan? These are your voters. These are people who are possibly just on a basic wage. Then they get offered overtime to earn those few extra dollars, yet you are denying those people you are supposed to support: the battlers. And they are the battlers; it's not a fortune that they're making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also remind this house that the average backbench politician on $200,000 will receive an extra $4,000, but many will get much more because their salaries are much higher than $200,000. How can Labor and the Greens deny these tax cuts to hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australians on taxable incomes from $120,000 up to $200,000 when they have accepted pay rises in excess of six per cent in recent times? Individuals who work in isolated and dangerous workplaces and are highly skilled have taxable incomes much greater than $100,000, and they include 31,998 coalminers. Mining technicians earn an average taxable income of $118,409; 2,706 plant operators earn an average taxable income of $136,985; and 234 pressure welders earn an average taxable income of $107,210.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I challenge Labor, who argue against tax cuts of $1,350 for those on $90,000 to $120,000 in four years time, to reject their minimum wage increase of $4,000 a year from July 2018. Bill Shorten will pocket an increase of over $7,000 from 1 July 2018 but says those who work long hours do not deserve a tax cut of a similar amount. I challenge Labor to set an example and reject the two per cent pay rise awarded by the Remuneration Tribunal last week. Knock back your pay rise, Labor. You don't want to give anyoneâ€”</span>

                    </a>  Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. I've had to toughen up in this place; it's a shame others don't do the same. The Australian Greens do not support any of the tax cuts because they feel every dollar is needed by the government for refugees, the Safe Schools program and subsidies for unreliable energy sources that will drive up electricity prices, and they want to dramatically lift the amount of money helping those in foreign countries. Labor wants to double the foreign aid budget, but the Greens want to almost triple the foreign aid budget to $12.28 billion. They want to give foreign aid, Australia's taxpayers' dollars, to overseas countries. They're not worried about hardworking Australians and giving them tax relief here. They want the money to go overseasâ€”$12.28 billion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson-Young read the bill and spoke on it, but unfortunately she did not understand it. It's quite funny when the senator makes comments about me. She said that I'm getting a tax cut. No, I'm not. I'm on the same wage as Senator Hanson-Young. The tax cuts are going to be up to $200,000. I'm a very fortunate Australian to be earning more than $200,000. I am paying tax of 45c in the dollar on that. I'm not getting tax relief. To make that comment is to mislead this parliament. I don't think she understands it. If she's really worried about pensioners and the battlers and everyone out there, then I suggest that she flies economy class, like I do, instead of sitting up the front of the plane, at more cost to taxpayers, or taking her child on a taxpayer funded whale-watchâ€”or the overseas trips.</span>

That there are people in here expecting Australians not to get a tax cut makes the whole place a jokeâ€”yet they don't want to take tax cuts themselves. The whole thing is that hardworking Australians need a helping hand. They need to know that they are going to get something backâ€”that something is being done for them. They are sick and tired of seeing everyone else around the world getting reliefâ€”we give foreign aid to everyone. People here are struggling to pay their bills. Because of the Greens in this room, renewable energy is sending up electricity prices and the cost of living. Australians cannot keep going at this rate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My dilemma is this: yes, we have a black hole, but are we going to fill that black hole? My proposal is to go after the multinationals to pay their fair share of tax in this country and to look after Australians, the hardworking families that need some relief and need help in this country. Yes, suspend taxation and suspend increases in politicians' wages and those of bureaucrats. How can you say to hardworking Australians, 'You can't get tax reliefâ€”even the highest amount of up to $7,000 a year,' yet bureaucrats are receiving pay increases of up to $17,000 a year? That doesn't pass the pub test for the Australian people and it doesn't pass the pub test for me.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I will be brief in my contribution to on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill. At the outset, I can indicate that Centre Alliance will be moving an amendment that omits stage 3 of the income tax cuts. I understand Labor will move an identical amendment. As an alternative to our amendment we will support theirs. Centre Alliance supports the stage 1 tax cuts. Stage 1 involves an end-of-year rebate for low-income earners and raises from $87,000 to $90,000 the income tax threshold to which the tax rate of 37 per cent applies. The combination of the two will return between $135 and $665 to low-income earners, depending on their income. It's our belief that stage 1 will provide much-needed relief for low-income earners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance will also support the stage 2 tax cuts. These tax cuts are scheduled to commence from July 2022, with the threshold for the 32.5 per cent bracket being lifted from $37,000 to $41,000 and the threshold for the 37 per cent bracket to go from $90,000 to $120,000. This will give tax relief to low- and medium-income earners and to mum and dad professionals, who have worked hard all of their lives and have helped to generate the recent growth we have seen in the economy. They are entitled to enjoy the fruits of their inputs to our economy. Many of the people in this tax bracket are dealing with large mortgages, high electricity bills and a general rise in the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As stated, our amendment knocks out stage 3 of the income tax cuts. Stage 3, which is scheduled to start in 2024, abolishes the 37 per cent tax bracket from the system, creating one middle tax bracket of 32Â½ per cent for workers who earn between $41,000 and $200,000 a year. We're not convinced that this is prudent at this point in time. We also note the distance in time between the passage of this bill into law and when the amendments come into effect. Whilst we are sympathetic to the idea that companies investing large sums of money on projects spanning multiple years, if not decades, may need to know tax rates into the out years, the same can't be said of individuals. So why commit to this law? Why not wait until there is clarity in the budget bottom line in 2022 or 2023 and then change the tax regime for high-income earners?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, we do reserve our position in regard to the third stage if our amendments are not successful or if an amended bill is rejected in the House, because we do think that low-income and medium-income earners deserve some tax relief.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I won't delay the Senate unnecessarily, but I do want to get on the record that the Australian Conservatives wholeheartedly endorse and support the government's approach to making personal income tax simpler and fairer in this country. You won't be getting ducks and drakes from us. There'll be no mysterious, 'I'll consider how it's going to come out in the wash.' I entirely support the government's package, because not only is it putting forward tax relief for low-income earners but it maps a pathway of tax relief and some certainty and surety for all taxpayers in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite simply, we pay too much tax. Government does not spend our money well enough to maintain the punitive rates of taxation that are impacting the lifestyles of everyday Australian families. It is absurd that our tax brackets are not indexed, that they are not flatter and that more cannot be done to reduce the need for people to pursue tax schemes which are disadvantageous to a great many. For those in this place who say that they want to see capital gains tax changes or changes to negative gearing, I would argue that, if you flatten the tax scales and reduce the need for people to pursue these schemes, the benefits of them to those that are taking advantage will also be reduced. So what we should be doing is looking to lower the tax thresholds across the board to simplify the accounting and taxation affairs for every single Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make the point, for the class warriors on the other side of the chamber, that about 48 per cent of Australians don't pay any net tax. The burden of taxation in this country is falling disproportionately on those who pay the most tax. That is the simple fact. If you want to reduce the tax burden, we need to reduce it, necessarily, on those that are paying the bulk of it, and we should also be reducing the cost of living and the onerous requirements that government imposes on those who are less fortunate than many of us. You can do that by reducing or taking out the government rorts and attachments that are in our energy industry. You can make our energy more competitive. You can reduce the need for people to pursue negative gearing, as I've touched upon, which will help make housing more affordable. You can reduce the bureaucracy attached to people's employment so that small business is further empowered to employ people and to drive the growth in our economy. They are the simple measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't need more government. We don't need to give more money to government. We need to get government the heck out of people's lives and let them take some responsibility for themselves. This tax package goes some way to doing that. I endorse it. I wholeheartedly support it. I hope the Senate will do that as well. If they want to have an election based upon one side of parliament putting up taxes and the other side reducing them, I say bring it on, because you will then have a commitment from the Australian people that they endorse low taxes and they think government is not worthy of taking more of their own money.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  Here we are engaged in a race to the bottom between the coalition and the Labor Party on personal tax cuts. Anyone would think there's an election in the airâ€”oh wait; there is an election in the air. Within 12 months the Australian voters are going to be choosing who they want to represent them in this place, to be their government, andâ€”surprise, surprise!â€”the Labor Party and the coalition are engaged in a race to the bottom on tax cuts. This debate at its heart is about what sort of country we want to be. I'm so proud that the Australian Greens senators are the only ones in this place standing up against this unholy race to the bottom on tax cuts and standing up instead for increasing the funding and quality of essential public services in this country: schools, hospitals and public transport; support for people with disabilities; funding for the environment, the fight against climate change, and threatened species; and funding for productive, long-term infrastructure for this country. The Australian Greens want both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to properly fund those things, not this race to the bottom on tax cuts, which is designed solely to try to solicit votes at the upcoming election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last two decades in this country there has been a deliberate attempt by the Labor and Liberal parties to pull apart our society. Economic inequality has massively grown because of decisions made by both the Labor and Liberal parties. Taxes have been cut for the big corporate donors to the Labor and Liberal parties. Personal income tax has been slashed, especially for the wealthiest people, while Newstart, which is supporting the people doing it toughest financially, has not been raised for a generationâ€”nearly 25 years. There has been a transfer of wealth from the less well-off to the most well-off, and now the Labor and Liberal parties are proposing to transfer yet more wealth, via these tax cuts, from people doing it tough to people who already have more than their fair share of our national wealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a stark choice facing the Australian people and this parliament at the moment. On one hand we can continue to run down our schools, hospitals and essential public services; on the other hand we can stand up for increasing the funding and quality of our essential public services. On one hand Labor and Liberal, neither of whom support raising Newstart, can continue to punish the poor to reward the rich; on the other hand the Australian Greens will stand up for people on Newstart. We want Newstart to be increased by $75 a week to give people a fair crack at rebuilding their lives and to help them avoid those impossible choices between putting food on the table, paying the school levies or paying the power bills. We can rebuild our Australian society in line with the values of looking after people doing it tough and of funding an increase in the quality of essential public services, or we can continue in a race to the bottom on tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something to the people of Braddon, who are facing this choice in their upcoming by-election. The choice for the people of Braddon is clear. They could vote for a tax cut that redistributes wealth from those at the bottom to those who already have more than their fair share. Remember, stage 1 of this tax plan will give a tax cut to people who earn $120,000 a year. That means that, if you're in a household with two people lucky enough to be earning 120 grand a yearâ€”that is a household that earns in the region of a quarter of a million dollars a yearâ€”that household is going to get a tax cut, but the people of Braddon on Newstart are being offered nothing by the Labor and Liberal parties, so they've got a choice. Either they can vote for a candidateâ€”Jarrod Edwards, an outstanding Greens candidate in Braddonâ€”who knows what it's like to do it tough, who was raised in a family on welfare, who knows what it's like to live on Struggle Street, who's campaigning strongly for a legislated increase in the minimum wage and a legislated increase in Newstart, or they can vote for Labor or Liberal candidates who want to give a tax cut to people on $120,000 a year. That's the choice facing the people of Braddon. I urge them to support Jarrod Edwards, the Australian Greens candidate, as the only candidate taking a policy to this election to increase Newstart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that would provide a significant economic benefit to Braddon, which sorely needs it. With an increase in Newstart and with an increase in the minimum wage, you would see cash starting to flow more freely through the economy of Braddon, which would help businesses in Braddonâ€”everything from small businesses in the corner shops to small businesses in the manufacturing sector, to people on farms and right through the economy of the north-west coast of Tasmania. The choice for the people of Braddon is very clear. You can vote for Jarrod Edwards and the Australian Greens for an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in Newstart, or you can vote for your Labor or Liberal candidates and vote to give tax cuts to people on $120,000 a year.</span>

Obviously the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018, which seeks to implement the government's plan to provide income tax relief to hardworking families across Australia, is a very important part of our plan for the economy and jobs to help low- and middle-income earners with cost-of-living-pressure relief but also to provide the right incentive, reward for effort and encouragement to all working Australians. With those few words, I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I'd like to seek to move some amendments immediately and then make a few comments. Obviously, in the second reading debate we have outlined in detail Labor's approach to this tax package. We've outlined Labor's better, bigger and fairer tax relief for working Australians. We have also indicated that we do not support steps 2 and 3 of the government's plan and the reasons why, so I don't propose to traverse those again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would again remind the Senate that, apart from the Australian Greens, as I have discerned, every contribution from senators in this place has supported step 1 of the tax plan. What we are part of at the moment is a debate on a bill where the government is seeking to hold those tax cuts for working Australiansâ€”which would start next monthâ€”hostage to a tax plan it wants to implement in six years time. There is no logical reason for that, and the Senate ought not to agree to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, I want to come to step 3 of the government's tax plan. As I outlined yesterday, we do regard this as both fiscally irresponsible and inherently unfair. It is fiscally irresponsible because, as I outlined in my speech on the second reading, this is a series of changes which grows in terms of its cost to the budget when it comes to fruition, or when it matures, at 12 per cent a year. I made the point in my speech on the second reading yesterday that that is substantially higher than the growth in expenditure we see across other areas of the budget. It is, for example, from memory, some three times faster annual growth than the defence budget and, I think, close to six times faster annual growth than expenditure on family tax benefits and so forth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Senate is being asked to do is to lock in a change to the structure of taxation in this country which will grow over the longer term at 12 per cent per year, thereby either rendering other decisions by government unsustainable or imposing decisions on key expenditure programs by government such as health, education and arguably even defence. If there were an expenditure program that was growing at 12 per cent a year you would hear those on the other side demanding that it be reduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I intend to move a range of amendments consistent with Labor's position that I've outlined in the speech on the second reading. What I would like to get to, because I think it is the area where there is most concern in the chamber about the tax plan, is our amendments on sheet 8450 which seek to remove the step 3 tax rate changes and those in later income years. I would seek leave to move items (4), (6) and (8) together, which remove the step 3 tax rates.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the tax rates that the government is seeking to change from 2024-25. What I would say to members of the crossbench and senators in this place is that we have two objections to this. One is a fundamental policy objection. It is a fiscal risk. It locks in a very fast-growing program which costs not only billions of dollars a year but grows at 12 per cent, which has consequences both for the budget and for economic and fiscal risk. It is also a fundamental restructure of our tax system. As I referred, one of the academics who made submissions to the Senate committee talked about this as being contrary to essentially 100 years of progressive taxation in this country. It is the wrong thing to do. I make the third point that it was well made by Senator Storer in his very careful and considered speech on the second reading that there is no reason to allow the government to hold these tax cuts, which would occur in six years timeâ€”you would have to elect Malcolm Turnbull twiceâ€”and make them a pre-condition of tax cuts which can be delivered next month. That is nothing other than a political strategy. As Senator Storer said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no reason to legislate tax cuts four and six years away except to hold future parliaments to ransom and hold out to voters what may well prove to be false hopes.</span>

                    <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  The government will be opposing these amendments. We obviously believeâ€”in fact, we are confidentâ€”that the bill as drafted is in the best interests of all hardworking Australians. It of course prioritises low- and middle-income earners in the first instance, providing cost of living pressure relief to low- and middle-income earners. It then also ensures that we provide the right and appropriate incentive to all working Australians to continue to work hard and ensure that working Australians don't go backwards as a result of bracket creep. Bracket creep is the result, even without moving up the career ladder, of inflation. Our income tax thresholds aren't indexed, which means that, if we do nothing, more and more middle-income Australians will be pushed into the higher and higher income tax brackets, which is a significant disincentive to work harder. It is also recognised as a drag on economic growth. What does a drag on economic growth mean? It means that growth will be less than it could be. A growth that will be less than it could be means that there will be fewer jobs created in the economy. Who hurts the most when there are fewer jobs created in the economy? It's low- and middle-income earners. They are the most exposed to lower growth and they have the most to gain from stronger growth, and there are a lot of economic studies that back that up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also make the point in response to what Senator Wong has just indicated. This is not an item of government expenditure. This is a decision by the parliament to leave working families around Australia with more of their own money. It's their money. The government should only take as little as possible but as much as necessary to fund the services and the administration of government, which ought to be and must be as efficient and as effective and as well targeted as possible. That is, of course, the commitment of our government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong says that this somehow completely undermines the progressivity of our tax system. That is completely and utterly wrong. Right now, the top 20 per cent of income earners across Australia have to pay more than 60 per cent of the income tax revenue generated by government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  So they should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  'So they should,' says Senator Whish-Wilson. Okay. Guess what happens if we legislate our seven-year plan in full? At the end of that seven-year period, do you know how much the top 20 per cent of income earners will be paying in income tax generated across Australia? More than 60 per cent. So, there's no change to the progressivity of our tax system. You know what will happen if we don't legislate this plan in full? We will be hitting aspirational, hardworking middle Australians harder and harder, and that 60 per cent will become 65, 70, 80 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this country don't have automatic indexation of our income tax thresholds. That means that just by wage inflation, just by simple inflation, more and more middle-income earners get pushed into the higher tax brackets, where they have to pay more tax on the income they take home. That is not even taking into account the fact that if you work more hours you get penalised. You work more hours; you get penalised by being pushed into a higher tax bracket. So why would you work more hours if working more hours means that you go from 37 per cent to 45 per cent plus the Medicare levy? It is absolutely recognised that bracket creep is a drag on economic growth and that it is absolutely desirable for bracket creep to be addressed in order to ensure that there isn't an entrenched structural disincentive for working Australians to continue to do everything they can to get ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong says that this is about binding future parliaments and that Malcolm Turnbull would have to get elected two more times for this to take effect. No, no; that is actually not true. The Senate is able to legislate today the full seven-year plan and give certainty to working families right across Australia that not only will we provide cost-of-living-pressure relief in the short term, prioritising low- and middle-income earners; we also will do everything we can to appropriately address bracket creep so that all working Australians have the right incentive, the right encouragement, the right reward for effort, the right incentive to continue to work hard and to contribute to our great country. They don't have to elect Malcolm Turnbull two more times to lock this in. The Senate is able to lock this in today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are making an assumption about what future parliaments might want to do. It might well be that the Labor Party want to add further tax increases to their pre-election agenda. Good luck to them! Good luck to them going to the next election promising to the Australian people that they will increase the tax burden on the economy by more than $200 billion, which everybody knows will hurt the economy. It will hurt families; it will cost jobs. The Labor Party is quite entitled to go to the next election with a higher-taxing agenda. We will not go to the next election with a higher-taxing agenda; we will go to the next election with a commitment to keeping taxes on families as low as possible and to ensuring that taxes on business are maintained at a level that is globally more competitive so that all Australians, today and into the future, have the best possible opportunity to get ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong also says these tax cuts are not affordable. Yes, they are. Over the medium term the cost is $144 billion, which is a figure that we've openly and transparently released to the public and to the parliament, in sharp contrast to what the Rudd and Gillard governments did when they tried to increase the tax burden on the mining industry. We had to drag them kicking and screaming into releasing the medium-term projections of the revenue they expected to raise from their resource super profits tax and the minerals resource rent tax. We've provided that information quite openly and transparently. And do you know what you can see in the budget papers? What you can see in the budget papers is that over the medium term, over that whole period, not only does the budget get into a small surplus by 2019-20 and progressively into a larger surplus but we are projected to exceed a surplus of one per cent of the share of GDP by 2026-27 and to remain in surplus all the way throughâ€”and that is after we have factored in the cost of this important reform which allows working families around Australia to keep more of their own money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just close on this point. I'm very interested to see that Senator Wong is moving an amendment effectively to excise the third stage out of our three-stage, seven-year long-term plan. I guess that means that the Labor Party have already given up on actually doing what they said they would do, which is to oppose everything other than the first stage of our seven-year plan. It's very interesting. Normally in this chamber the way this process is managed is that you start off with getting all you want and then you progressively work your way backwards to being forced into the position where, if you can't get everything you want, you aim to get an amendment up that gives you 70 or 60 per cent of what you want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that Senator Wong in her first amendment hasn't even tried to implement the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. It must mean that the Labor Party's split. It must mean that Senator Wong has stabbed Bill Shorten in the back and turned on Bill Shorten, because she's not in here promoting Bill Shorten's policy to actually excise stages 2 and 3. Maybe Senator Wong is a secret supporter of stage 2 of our three-stage, seven-year plan to provide income tax relief to working families around Australia. I'm very intrigued that the first move that Senator Wong makes in this chamber would not be a move to implement the policy that was articulated by the Leader of the Opposition. Is it now the Labor Party position that you support stages 1 and 2 of our seven-year plan to provide income tax relief to working families around Australia? I would be very interested. Is that now your position? It's a very interesting move by Senator Wong here which is in sharp contrast to what Bill Shorten, as leader of the Labor Party, has signalled into the community would be the Labor Party position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, as the Labor caucus finished and the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer gave a press conference yesterday, the indication that the Australian people were given was that Labor would move to remove both phase 2 and phase 3 from this income tax bill. That is not what Senator Wong is doing in her move now. Senator Wong, essentially, has now accepted stages 1 and 2. I congratulate the Labor Party that you've moved along from one to two. There's only one more step to go! Now that you support the first two phases of our income tax relief plan, which is in three parts, I encourage you strongly to reflect on the fact it is very much in our national interests and in the interests of working families around Australia for us to, yes, provide cost-of-living-pressure relief for low- and middle-income earners but also to address bracket creep so that all working families around Australia have the right incentive, the right encouragement and the right reward for effort so the Australian economy can continue to grow as strongly as possible and as many jobs as possible can be created.</span>

                    </a>  The Greens as a party believe that government has a strong role to play in the lives of Australian people. We believe that governments and the provision of services are absolutely essential to our quality of life, for caring for people, for looking after the environment. We've always said that. We also believe governments have a role, a collective responsibility, to invest in the Australian people and in the economy through, for example, infrastructure programs. You can't have $144 billion of revenue without an opportunity cost, Senator Cormannâ€”to you, Chair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we haven't had a debate about the opportunity costs of $144 billion. But I do want to pose this question to the Australian people: if you could invest $144 billion, what would you do with it? What this government's doing today and what the Labor Party are doing with their package is simple. They are saying: 'How much is your vote worth at the next election? If you're earning $37,000, $40,000 or $45,000â€”up to $60,000â€”we'll give you $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, maybe $10 a week. That's what your vote is worth to us. This is a bribe.' This is an election trick. It is a bribe for the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if you were to say to the Australian people, 'Would you rather your $5 a week was invested back in a world-class education system, a proper healthcare system, a fully funded NDIS, an NBN, a threatened species plan or reducing climate change?' I bet you, London to a brick, that Australians would say: 'That's your job. That's what I elect you for. You invest that money for the future of our society and our kids.' That's what the Australian people would want. That's not the way this question has been posed, but that is fundamentally what we're debating here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had a very consistent position that we won't be supporting any of these tax cuts. Now is not the time to be cutting revenueâ€”taking revenue and giving it back in tax cuts. What else have we seen cut in recent times? Can any senator in this chamber put their hand on their heart and say that we have enough revenue now to cover our services and fund our needs in society? No. Everywhere we look, this government is cutting funds, and it has been cutting funds since it was first elected. Think back to the zombie budget cuts in 2013-14. Think of the efficiency dividends. I'll list a few things for you, Senator Cormann. Hundreds of millions of dollars were cut from ARENA and $334 million was cut from the ABC, with more to comeâ€”there's absolutely no doubt about that. There've been cuts to legal aid funding, the Medicare rebate freeze, billions cut from family tax benefit supplements, cuts to ASIC, cuts to CSIRO, cuts to the environment department, R&amp;D offsets cut, local government grants cut, ATSI Affairs cutâ€”I could go on. We don't have enough revenue at the moment, so why are we taking $144 billion of tax revenue and giving it back in tax cuts, a few dollars a week, to the Australian public, who I'm sure have put us in this place to make sure that tax revenue is properly invested?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while we don't support tax cuts at this point in time, we do want to make sure that what we do in this committee stage at least improves the bill in any way, shape or form so that, when it gets to the final vote, we can at least try to get a better outcome for the Australian people. This tax package is not a good outcome. It is a total con. We'll have a lot more to say about this during the continuing committee stage.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  I can't let this go unchallenged. I listened to Senator Whish-Wilson and his comments that we want to cut services. He made a list of where cuts have been made. I think the majority of Australians have no doubt that the ABC budget should be cut back, and it has been cut back, to the tune of about $84 million. But let's have a look at the Greens. What they're saying is that they are concerned about services here in Australia. They want to make sure that there are good educational services and good hospital care for the Australian people. Yet, if they had their way, our foreign aid would go up to $12.28 billion. That's not for Australians. That's to go overseas. They're worried about everyone else around the world. They're not worried about the Australian people here. Where's their concern? They are saying that the people here, hardworking Australians, are not entitled to a tax cut because we need the money for services. How can they say that when they're supposed to be here representing the Australian people and yet they're prepared to say they want over $12 billion to go on foreign aid if they had their way? So I think it is not fair to make that comment. They need to start focusing on Australia and the Australian people, because they want to open up the floodgates to 50,000 refugees. Every refugee in this country in detention costs the Australian taxpayer $572,000. That is a huge cost to the taxpayers. They want to start focusing on what is right for this country and the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the Australian people are doing it tough because of extra costs due to the Greens pushing for renewables. That has escalated the cost of living for every Australian. The cost of electricity is out of control. I was just over in England with a delegation. An average family is charged 500 pounds to 600 pounds a year for electricity. An average household here is looking at around $2,000 a year. This is due to the Greens and the Labor Party wanting to raise the cost of renewables and the billions that will be paid to foreign companies. No-one is really addressing this. So stop tinkering around the edges. Be up-front and honest with the Australian people. Give the Australian people some assistance, because that's what they're crying out for. You are obviously not listening to them.</span>

The first is that these parts we are opposing are in relation to step 3. The government would be aware and the chamber should be aware that we have a range of amendments across step 2 and we are seeking to insert Labor's tax plan. We seek to knock out the tax changes that would apply only from 2024-25. Senator Cormann sought to rebut some of what I said. He said, 'It's not a fiscal risk.' Well, you don't have to take my words for it. Take John Daley's words. His evidence at the Senate inquiry was:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ we do not think it is prudent to be providing tax cuts of this magnitude that far in the futureâ€”certainly not to be legislating them â€¦</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, he said that it's still progressive. Miranda Stewart of the ANU said that these changes are 'both an inefficient and a retrograde step that undermines 100 years of progressive income tax rate structure in Australia'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And he said that they're fair. The ANU's Ben Phillips has estimated that the effect of the government's plan is as follows: the top 20 per cent of taxpayers will see a 2.2 per cent rise in their income and the bottom 20 per cent will see a 0.2 per cent rise in their income. So the top 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers get moreâ€”a 2.2 per cent riseâ€”and the lowest 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers get 0.2 per cent. Guess how much of this government's tax package will go to the top 20 per cent of households in Australia by 2027? Sixty per cent. I urge the chamber to support our proposal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given our substantial debt challengeâ€”$341 billion net debt in 2017-18, and growingâ€”it is irresponsible to proceed with the full income tax plan proposed by the government at this point in time. The measures commencing in 2022 and 2024 lock in over $120 billion in reductions in revenue out to 2028-29. By Treasury's own admission, uncertainties generally tend to increase as the forecast horizon lengthens; therefore, there are larger error bands around estimates three, four or more years ahead. The geopolitical and economic uncertainties noted by Treasury in budget estimates in May demand the government prepare by focusing on debt and deficit reduction as well as maintaining essential services. We are in a substantially weaker budgetary position now than we were in 2007 in the lead-up to the GFC. There's no need to rush these changes that commence in 2022 and 2024. They are well beyond the scope of the forward estimates and the next election. There will be ample time between now and then for parliament to re-examine the appropriateness of these measures and decide whether to proceed with the additional elements of the government's plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">History tells us that tax cuts, once legislated, are very difficult to wind back; therefore, we cannot rely on an assumption that these cuts could be repealed or amended if unforeseen economic developments materialised. In the context of a recent uplift in government revenue, the measures set to commence from 1 July 2018 are affordable. Given rising cost-of-living pressures and wage stagnation, the new low- and middle-income tax offset is particularly warranted and should be locked in to provide lasting targeted support to low- and middle-income earners beyond the forward estimates. With that extension, information received from the Parliamentary Budget Office indicates that the amended plan I am putting forward would cost $46.75 billion compared with the $143.95 billion for steps 1, 2 and 3 of the government's plan as it stands, and $102.35 billion for steps 1 and 2. The amended proposal I am putting forward of $46.75 billion generates savings that would help us return to surplus sooner, pay down debt quicker and free up money to spend on critical social and infrastructure programs, and I hope that it meets with the approval of the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  The government will not be supporting this amendment. We will be opposing this amendment. This amendment proposes to keep taxes around $100 billion higher than the government's plan over the medium term. I have to correct Senator Storer: it's not a saving; it is an increase in taxes compared to what the government is proposing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes in lower taxes because individuals should be rewarded for working hard and be encouraged to get ahead. The government's Personal Income Tax Plan will make personal income tax lower, fairer and simpler. Without action, the tax system will increasingly penalise Australians for earning more as they move into higher tax brackets. This is why the government does not support the amendments proposed by Senator Storer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's plan will simplify and flatten the tax system, reducing the number of brackets from five to four by completely removing the 37 per cent marginal tax rate so that hardworking Australians keep more of what they earn. Senator Storer's amendments would mean that by 2024-25 taxpayers on an average full-time wage would still face a marginal tax rate of 37 per cent. The government's plan rewards these hardworking Australians by removing the 37 per cent marginal rate and will ensure that most Australians will face a marginal tax rate no higher than 32.5 per cent for their whole working life. Under the government's plan, around 94 per cent of taxpayers are projected to face a marginal tax rate of 32.5 per cent or less, compared with the 63 per cent if we leave the system unchanged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan is a package and the government is legislating the whole package. We're committed to giving certainty to Australian families that they will keep more of what they earn in the future. Step 2 of the plan will have to ensure that incomes earned by Australians are protected from bracket creep. It helps to ensure that a pay rise, extra overtime or working more hours do not get eaten up by higher taxes. Step 3 of the plan will make the personal income tax system simpler and flatter by completely removing the 37 per cent tax bracket. By sticking to our plan for a stronger economy, the government is returning the budget to surplus and guaranteeing the essentials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because a stronger economy delivers more revenue to the budget, we are able to afford our Personal Income Tax Plan. It is affordable and fiscally responsible. The plan is fully accounted for in the forward estimates and over the medium term fiscal projections, with the underlying cash balance returning to balance in 2019-20 and sustained surpluses thereafter over the medium term. The government is committed to a tax system that rewards effort and promotes opportunity, that is internationally competitive, that is capable of driving stronger investment and stronger growth for our economy and where, above all, all individuals and businesses pay their fair share so the government can deliver the essential services Australians rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the observations on the fiscal position of the budget, the return to surplus in 2019-20 and continuing projected surpluses over the medium term will, of course, enable a reduction in debt. As a result of living within our means, the government has turned the corner on debt. We're no longer borrowing for our day-to-day living expenses as a government. Net debt, as a share of GDP, is expected to peak at 18.6 per cent of GDP in this 2017-18 financial year. It's projected to fall to 14.7 per cent by 2021-22 and to 3.6 per cent at the end of the medium term. The gross debt will also peak in 2019-20 at below 30 per cent of GDP. Over the medium term gross debt will fall and be $126 billion less in 2027-28 than was estimated in the MYEFO last December, six or seven months ago. I should also say that government net debt is forecast and projected to reduce by $30 billion over the current forward estimates and $232 billion over the medium term. This reduction in debt has been achieved through careful management of the nation's budget, with the average annual real expenditure remaining below two per cent, which is the lowest of any government in the last 50 years, while delivering much needed tax relief to hardworking families and investing to further strengthen our economy and deliver a more prosperous future for all Australians.</span>

I want to be really clear about this, because Senator Hanson was in here only an hour or so ago saying, here on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record during this debate, that she would not be getting any tax cut if this bill passed. Can you believe it? She's either got no idea what on earth she's voting on or she's lying to the Australian people and she's misleading the Senate. Let's crunch the numbers. Let's find out exactly how much Senator Pauline Hanson is going to get from this tax cut: an $11,815 tax cut. That's how much Senator Pauline Hanson has just pocketed for herself. That's what she's just voted for. She's just voted to feather her own nest. She came in here and lied to the Australian people. She lied to One Nation voters. She said she wasn't getting a tax cut at all. What a fraud.</span>

                    </a>  Chair, I make a couple of points. I understand Senator Gallacher's frustration. We get a lot of 'lying' accusations from the other side. I think your ruling is correct. If you look at precedents, past Presidents have ruled that an assertion that a group is lying doesn't have the same status as an assertion that an individual senator is lying. I personally don't quite understand the distinction but, as I understand the advice, that appears to be a distinction that has been observedâ€”the former has been permissible and the latter hasn't. I would implore Senator Hanson-Young to recognise the Chair's request.</span>

                    </a>  On the same point of order, my understanding of the standing orders is that the context of how things are said is important, in terms of rulings. Senator Hanson-Young didn't say that Senator Hanson deliberately lied. She said she lied. It may have been inadvertent or it may have been deliberate; we don't know. In that sense, I'd ask you to reflect on the fact that she didn't say she deliberately lied.</span>

We have a situation in this chamber where a single vote will dictate whether a $144 billion tax package gets locked in for the Australian people, a package that my party, the Australian Greens, disagrees with so strongly on so many levels. If a senator in this placeâ€”and none of us is perfect; we all make mistakes, myself includedâ€”gets up in here during a critical committee stage before a vote to remove stage 3 of this bill and doesn't understand what she's voting onâ€”literally doesn't understand the detail of why, even by changing a tax bracket, a threshold, she will benefit from thatâ€”then she simply doesn't understand how any of it works.

We have a long-term plan to provide income tax relief to families around Australia which prioritises low- and middle-income earners. Over the next four years, the benefit goes to low- and middle-income earners. What I would say to the Senate and what I would say to the Greens is that I would draw the attention of the Greens to the fact that the value of the personal income tax cut for low-income earners is significantly higher than the value, as a percentage, for people at the higher income end.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Rice laughs: 'Ha, ha! As a percentage.' 'As a percentage,' Senator Rice says, 'Oh! Oh!' So let me just explain to the chamber what this means. This means that, if they earn $30,000 a year, the value of our proposed personal income tax cut is a reduction of 8.3 per cent in their tax, an 8.3 per cent cut in their tax, in 2018-19, in 2019-20, in 2020-21 andâ€”yes, you guessed itâ€”in 2021-22. And do you know what happens to somebody on $200,000 in that period? Do you know what happens to somebody on $200,000 in the years 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22? The value of the small proportion of the personal income tax cut that flows through to the higher income earners, because we are lifting the threshold from $87,000 to $90,000, is 0.2 per centâ€”0.2 per cent!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know how much tax somebody who earns $30,000 a year pays? They pay $2,197. I'm really sorry that we can't cut the tax for somebody who pays $2,197 in tax by $5,000! I'm really sorry! Not even this government can cut the tax for somebody who pays $2,197 by $5,000. That is not physically possible. But do you know how much tax somebody who earns $200,000 pays? They pay $67,097. So somebody who earns $30,000 a year pays $2,197, and somebody who earns $200,000 a year pays $67,097. And do you know what? In 2018-19 the percentage of cumulative tax relief is 0.2 per cent, in 2019-20 it is 0.2 per cent and in 2021-22 it is 0.2 per cent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see that the Greens have great confidence in the competitiveness of Pauline Hanson's One Nation and the Greens are very confident that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will secure Senate seats in the election after next. We're going to have an election next year. We're going to have another election in 2022, which is when Senator Hanson will be up for re-election, and clearly the Greens have given Senator Hanson their vote of confidence today. Senator Hanson-Young today has expressed a clear, strong and unambiguous vote of confidence that Senator Hanson will be re-elected at the 2022 election. That is the implication of what Senator Hanson-Young has been sayingâ€”that outrageous slur that she has directed at Senator Hanson, one of our fellow senators in this chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just explain further to all Australians who might be listening. If you are earning $50,000 a year, you will get, under this package that we are proposing to legislate today, a 6.2 per cent tax cut every single year over the next four years. If you are earning $80,000 a year, it'll be a lesser tax cut, but you're still getting a 2.8 per cent tax cut. So the point is: the more you earn, the lower the value of the tax cut. Obviously, if you pay more tax in nominal terms, in nominal terms it is inevitable that a smallâ€”</span>

                    </a>  Hang on. So here we have Senator McAllister having just stabbed her leader in the back, because she's just voted against Labor Party policy. Yesterday, out of the caucus came the Labor Party, including the Leader of the Labor Party and the shadow Treasurer, and they said, 'We will move to remove phases 2 and 3 of this long-term tax relief plan. Well, guess what: Senator McAllister has just voted in support of both stages 1 and 2, in complete conflict with the stated Labor Party position. She doesn't even realise that she has voted that way. Senator McAllister just shakes her head. Well, that is precisely what you've done: instead of putting your preferred position forward in front of the Senate chamber today, instead of coming in here with a policy that your Labor caucus allegedly adopted and trying to get majority support for the position that you adopted, you came in here with a position of another party. So clearly, somewhere overnight, the Labor Party position has shifted. Yesterday you only supported stage 1 and you were opposed to stages 2 and 3. Today you have votedâ€”including you, Senator McAllisterâ€”for stages 1 and 2. That is the reality of it.</span>

                    </a>  Are you saying that you did not vote in favour of stages 1 and 2? You did. That is the implication. The implication of supporting the removal of stage 3 only is that you are now supporting stages 1 and 2. It makes absolutely no sense for you not to have tried to get your policy tested in the Senate. You didn't test it in the Senate. You did not even try. Yesterday, with lots of fanfare, there were Bill Shorten and the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, saying, 'We are opposed to stages 2 and 3.' But here you're coming in now and endorsing stage 2. You're endorsing it. Senator Wong is shaking her head. That is precisely the implication of what the Labor Party has done in the chamber here today. The Labor Party has now shifted from just 1 to 1 and 2. If we keep this debate going for a bit longer, I'm sure that Labor will come all the way with the Liberal and National Party coalition to 1, 2 and 3. Try it! One, then 1 and 2; if we keep going a bit longerâ€”we know that Bill Shorten is the wibble-wobble manâ€”we get to 1, 2 and 3. Just go back to the Labor caucus. Say, 'We've already rolled over on our opposition to stage 2. We have voted for an amendment that locks in stage 2.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I must comment to Minister Cormann that he demonstrated some better dance moves there than the member for Dawsonâ€”if that is even possible!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now a change of pace, if I might. In the time I have I want to make two parts to my contribution to the chamber. The first is to place on the record, on behalf of, I suspect, all of us, our congratulations to the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia as they celebrated their 90th year of providing essential life-saving services to the people of Australia. I'll focus a little bit more in relation to my case as a senator for Queensland. Without the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Queensland, arguably over that period of time quite literally hundreds of thousands of people would have lost their lives. We have nearly 37,000 airlifts each year. When you're airlifted, for the most part it's because your injuries are very, very serious; indeed, in so many cases they are life-threatening. You're airlifted only because the most practical and essential thing to do for a patient is to take them to areas where there is a higher order of care. In my home state that's Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane, Toowoomba and places like that. Think about that for a moment as we pay tribute to this organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 37,000 patients are transported by air every year. I ask colleagues in the chamber to contemplate communities in their states with a population of 40,000 people. Imagine, if you will, that every one of those people found themselves in need of critical or life-saving care and one organisation was able to service that entire community. It is an amazing achievement on the part of this wonderful organisation. It comes as no surprise to those of us who are big fans of the RFDS, and of course that view is not just my view. For seven years in a row, according to the charity reputation index of this country, they have been the most reputable charity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the airlifts that I spoke of, of course, there are almost 70,000 road transport movements of patients each year. This isn't someone across town. This isn't someone who is taken from one medical institution in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Cairns or Townsville to another; these are movements that are largely from remote places where, again, if so many hundreds of thousands of these patients were not moved by the Royal Flying Doctor to be taken to acute care, many of them would be in a lot of trouble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 336,000 patient contacts a year across the country. This is where the Royal Flying Doctor Service provides clinics where they go into really inaccessible areas where the patients or people who are consulting them still might have to travel 300, 400 or 500 kilometres by dirt, making their way to these clinics and taking days out of their lives in many cases to be able to take advantage of the delivery of this service. I'm very proud to say this on the part of the government. I don't want to make a political point here, because I suspect that, even if it were a Labor government, they would quite properly pay attention to the proper funding of the RFDS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of my contribution here to the chamber will be about drought and particularly drought in my home state of Queensland and the impact it's having. With the drought has come a massive increase in the incidence of people needing mental health care. So, accordingly, the Royal Flying Doctor Service have established a new mental health outreach service, and they've been given an $84 million funding boost by the coalition government to do that. Again, I don't want to try to make any political point about the funding announcementâ€”although, of course, supporting the Royal Flying Doctor Service and organisations like that which service provincial, rural and regional Australia comes very naturally to the coalition. We've had a long and very close association with those remote areas of Australia. I think it is fair to say, unless someone wants to contradict me, that from a political point of view they support our government as well. Very few of the larger electorates away from the metropolitan areas are not held by a member of the coalition or a fellow traveller. I want to spend time speaking about the impacts of the drought in my home state, but let me close the first part of my contribution by congratulatingâ€”and I hope I do so on behalf of the entire chamberâ€”the Royal Flying Doctor Service for a wonderful delivery of service to our nation over the last 90 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the drought, I'll concentrate on where I know bestâ€”my home state of Queensland. We've got 31 councils that are completely droughted and three councils that are partially droughted. This represents over 66 per cent of my home state. So two-thirds is under drought. Some of those areas have been under drought for almost seven years. I'm not going to repeat my arguments from before about how weakened these communities were as they went into the drought as a result of the issues that presented with the suspension of the live cattle trade into Indonesia in 2011. But in seasons that should have prepared them with more resilience to go into this dry period and drought they were denied that opportunity because of the impacts on the marketplace when quite literally millions of head of cattle came into the domestic market. That drove prices down to the lowest we had seen, in some instances, in 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want us to consider something again. I want to, for a moment, pretend that we're in the House of Representatives and that we represent an electorate out west and that electorate has 100,000 people. I did this with my colleagues in our joint party room, without disclosing our discussion, some time ago. Imagine that, wherever you live, a third of the school population has left. They've gone. They're just not attending school anymore. They've actually left the district. In western Queensland, which is that far western area west of the Great Dividing Range, the population has decreased by 20 per cent in the last six years due to the impacts of the drought. We've got projections that suggest that Queensland will have a population growth of 32 per cent between now and 2025, but in these areas the projections are minus three per cent. Our unemployment average was at about six per cent. We had periods in the west where our unemployment was down around five per cent. It is now, in some places, up as high as 27 per cent. So these are people who don't have a lot of choices. The value of their homes has collapsed, in many instances by up to one-third, because of the drought and because of the migration out of the west of people who don't have jobs or job prospects, so they're left with the property they bought three or four years ago and it's now worth a third less than it was at the point of their purchase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have so many more facts, and at my very next opportunity I'll finish with respect to my presentation on this point. This is critical. This is a natural phenomenon, if we accept all of the arguments, and it's a disaster. This is a natural disaster in the same way that cyclones, floods, fires and other catastrophes are. I urge all senators, at least for a part of their day, to turn their minds to the struggle that people of the west are having and reflect on it as they make decisions in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  We know in Australia that the economy, supposedly of jobs and growth, is absolutely not delivering for middle Australians. Hardworking Australian men and women are working in an environment where their efforts are simply no longer rewarded with higher wages. They're feeling the pain of that in the choices that they need to make for themselves and for their families, and the opportunities that they are able to provide for the children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia has described Australia as experiencing a 'crisis of low pay'. We know that wage growth remains stubbornly at record lows. We've heard time and time again from hardworking Australian men and women that they're absolutely struggling with the current context of their wage situation. Rising costs of living and failure to manage the electricity costs of this countryâ€”despite their bragging about their solution to major national problemsâ€”sees this government simply out of touch with hardworking, ordinary Australians, who are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, we have a government that continues to malign unions who stand up for hardworking, ordinary Australians. Many Australians find their first jobs in the retail sector, and I know that one very important union that represents them and helps them understand the rights and responsibilities that they have in the workplace is the SDAâ€”the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association. It's one of Australia's largest trade unions. The membership that it covers looks after young people and older people working in retail, in fast food, in warehousing, in hairdressing, in pharmacy and also in modelling. The SDA's continued and consistent advocacy has helped ensure that Australian retail and fast-food workers are, I'm glad to say, amongst the highest paid workers in the retail industry in the world. That didn't just happen by accident. It didn't happen by an act of generosity. It happened because of hard work by a union and its representatives in the workplace who stood up for working Australians. Earlier this year they demonstrated this again with their advocacy for the new Coles agreement that has recently come into effect and that covers the pay and working conditions of over 80,000 Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to put on the record my congratulations to the SDA, their delegates and their members. In particular, I would like to single out a few delegates for their dedication and their hard work. Through their efforts they have managed to improve the conditions and lives of 80,000 Australian men and women, and that is no small feat. In particular I'd like to acknowledge Bernardine Kennedy from Greenhills, Glad Caldwell from Kotara, Kelly Brown from Kotara, Angela Chivers from Lisarow, Jill Kennedy from Salamander Bay, Donna Ball from The Junction, Iris Fraser from Newcastle, Charmain Cribb from Waratah, Moya Bell from Umina, Heidi Bodkin from Erina, Christine Weyling from Wadalba, Lynley Gosevich from Toukley and Mark Crowfoot from Cessnock. These are people who have stood up for their fellow Australians in their workplace. They have done that out of goodwill for their workplace, for the people who work alongside them and to make sure that fair conditions are actually enabled.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The SDA and its delegates, on behalf of members, secured this new agreement, which included preserving above-award take-home pay and conditions. Thanks to their efforts, over 80,000 Coles workers will receive pay risesâ€”in just a couple of weeks, in Julyâ€”for each year of the agreement, and workers already received an immediate one-off payment earlier this year. This is particularly significant at a time when, under this government, wages are at record lows and cost-of-living pressures are crippling so many households. Thanks to their efforts, penalty rates, which remain a fundamental part of a strong safety net for Australian workers, will mirror the award. This is also particularly significant at this time when the Turnbull government will not join with Labor and the unions to fight to protect penalty rates. In fact, they nearly celebrated in dance-like movements on the other side of this chamber when penalty rates were cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the SDA's efforts, casual employees, subject to some conditions, have the right to request to convert to full-time or part-time work if they have worked a pattern of hours over 12 months. This is particularly significant at this time when the workforce is increasingly casualised, not due to the choice of workers. This matters particularly for young people, who need the benefit of secure work to have a sense that they can buy into their own future. What I've seen, sadly, in many of the young people I have met in the course of my work with mental ill health is a constant sense of uncertainty about the world in which they live, with insecure work, uncertainty about pay and conditions, and the removal of penalty rates. All of that's happened in the five years that this government has been in place. It creates a pressure cooker that manifests itself in distress and anxiety, which are absolutely on the rise. Among young people in particular, but increasingly across the nation, that escalates into the lack of hope and the despair that we're seeing manifest, in the worst instances, in terrible loss of life as people commit suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of unions, alongside good work in this parliament, can transform the lives of Australians for the better. Sadly, we've seen unions and their hard work totally maligned by those opposite. I know that the young people in my community who go to work are very much supported by the work of the SDA in ensuring that they find safe working conditions when they enter into their first job in retail. It's clear to me that the SDA and its delegates have done a remarkable job in securing improved pay and conditions for Coles workers. I want to commend them for their efforts and I want to signal to other large corporates that ethical practice in business is surely good for business as well as for the workers who are a vital part of that business's success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time that remains to me, I would like to put on the record my profound respect for an amazing Australian who passed earlier this year, Professor David Cooper AC. Professor Cooper, born in Sydney in 1949, sadly passed away earlier this year, and I was honoured to be able to attend his memorial service at Sydney Town Hall last week, on 14 June. There were many tributes to this remarkable Australian who gave his life to the medical profession, a man of incredible compassion and care for his patients, a man of wonderful intellect, and a man of generosity of spirit who transformed the lives of so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the AIDS crisis hit Australia, Professor David Cooper's practical work in discerning the immunity dimensions of that illness was world-beating. It was at the cutting edge. He continued in that work throughout his life. I felt it was an amazing tribute that so many attended from overseas to give him the acknowledgement that he so truly deserved. I want to point to the survival of Craig Cooper, a former patient of David Cooper and CEO of Positive Life NSW, who spoke at the memorial service about how Professor Cooper had looked after him and others. Craig contracted HIV very early on in the period when the disease was becoming known. It is just amazing, when we remember that people thought this disease was going to be a death sentence for everyone, to think that one of David Cooper's very first patients actually has outlived him and was there to pay tribute to him. What a remarkable testimony to the work of one man in his lifetime!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge his amazing family for their generosity in sharing such a beautiful man with the world. Dorrie, Becky, Llana, Dan, Max and Teddy, your generosity in sharing 'Papa Coops', as you called him, with the rest of the world has left an amazing legacy. In your comments on the day and, indeed, in the notations in the book, you spoke of his delight in acknowledging others for enabling him to do the work. A man of great intellect, a man of great heart, a great Australianâ€”we have lost him. I want to put on the record my great respect for him, his work and his family. </span>

                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  This is a very special senators' statement for me today. I've just passed my sixth year in this place, officially. Nearly six years ago, as a new senator, I did my first 'senators' statements', as it was calledâ€”it's now a matter of public interestâ€”on the growing threat of marine plastics, or plastics in our oceans. I understand it was the first speech that had ever been given in this place on the issue of plastic pollution in our oceans. When I gave that speech six years ago, the issue of marine plastic pollution was not yet seen by many people as a major environmental threat, but it was certainly something that I had been campaigning on for many years before I came into parliament. I mentioned two scientists at the time: Dr Jen Lavers and Dr Denise Hardesty, who were amongst a small group of scientists who had begun to sound the alarm about what was going on in our oceans. Since that time, through continued research and publications, the importance and urgency of this issue has become mainstream and has risen to be seen as one of the great environmental challenges of our time, globally. How quickly things are progressing gives me heart. I want to say here today that there is so much more we have to do and we need some real political leadership and action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The oceans cover nearly 70 per cent of the earth's surface. Madam Acting Deputy President McCarthy, I remember your first speech in this place and how you reflected on the importance of oceans to your community. The oceans account for 99 per cent of all the habitable space for life on this planet. I understand why so many people simply assume that through their sheer size and majesty they are impregnable to our human actionsâ€”but they're not. Thanks to us, the oceans are fast becoming broken. If you want to see heartbreaking testimony to this, please watch a film called <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span> by filmmaker Chris Jordan. This is a very powerful and moving testimony to our increasingly broken relationship with nature. Through this movie, you travel to Midway Atoll and live with the albatrosses. Because albatrosses have no natural predators, the filmmaker was able to live with them. He spent eight years filming these beautiful birds. Every atom and every molecule in those birds has, over millions of years of evolution, come from subsisting on the ocean. Now, sadly, these birds are collecting plastic every time they fly out over the ocean to feed. They are feeding that to their chicks, and they are dying in their thousands. This is a story that is repeated for our shearwaters off the Tasmanian and east coast of Australia and for so many other marine speciesâ€”turtles, whales and dolphins. It is a really serious issue, and the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span> is a very powerful testimony. It is really important to frame up this issue and make people understand what we are doing. In fact, the filmmaker postulates that Midway is halfway between the two great continents in the Pacific Ocean and that, if we don't change the way we live, we're halfway to our own destruction as a species. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People don't understand that plastic pollution comes from our behaviour. Someone recently called it the 'detritus of humanity'. Plastic pollution is like the dandruff that the human species sheds into the environment as we get on with our daily lives. It's plastic bags, straws, chupa-chup holdersâ€”a whole range of things that make their way into the ocean as litter stream, break down and have very serious negative impacts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand how difficult it is to imagine that something seemingly so small would have such a big impact on something as large as our oceans and essentially become an existential threat to the life and species on this planet. I'll give you two reasons why. We produce so much of the bloody stuffâ€”the world produces 400 million tonnes of plastic every yearâ€”and around eight million tonnes is estimated to go into the ocean. That's expected to triple in the next 20 years. One recent study of microplasticsâ€”and of course all plastic ends up as microplastics, which is bits of plastic that are small enough to get into planktonâ€”estimated that, as at 2014, there are 51 trillion pieces of microplastic in the ocean. We are finding it in plankton in Antarctica and all through our oceans. Our oceans are turning into plastic soup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The message is that every little thing you can do helps to reduce plastic pollution, especially the way you liveâ€”reduce, refuse, reuse, redesignâ€”but my message today is that it won't be enough to tackle this problem. We need hundreds of millions of people doing the same thing at the same time if we're actually going to beat this issue. That requires political action, not just here in Australia but globally. That's really what I want to talk to you about today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I made my first speech on this in 2012 we have had a very successful Senate inquiry. Senator Urquhart is in here today. I thank her for her participation in that inquiry into marine plastics. We released a great report. It was groundbreakingâ€”we were the first parliament in the world to do this. It was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Toxic tide</span>. It raised a lot of eyebrows and got international media attention. I point out today that the government is yet to respond to that report that is over two years old. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it has done a lot. It has crystallised a lot of action around this country. We've now seen, for example, container deposit schemes implemented in New South Wales, and they are close to being implemented in Queensland and Western Australia. We are seeing a gradual move towards banning microbeads and plastic bags, and other key recommendations. Yet the government is still asleep at the wheel on many of the key recommendations in that report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to say today that the science around marine plastic in recent years has been driving this debate, but we need so much more of it. We need it to be properly funded. This was a key recommendation of the Senate report. The Greens have recommended having a cooperative research centre, with five years of government funding, that is backed by industry and stakeholders all around the world. Let's throw the kitchen sink at this problem. It's not just understanding the impacts of marine plastic; it's looking at research and development on the solutions that are necessary for this. That will need industry participation. For example, how do we phase out single-use plastics? That is what's coming around the corner. We desperately need this research to help inform the debate and, hopefully, find the best way to take action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the speech six years ago, long-campaigning healthy ocean champions have had some powerful allies join their campaigns for healthy oceans. The Queen has recently come on board with this issue. She is a champion of healthy, clean oceans. Sir David Attenborough, with his <span style="font-style:italic;">Blue Planet</span> series, has had a massive impact on this. Public attention has also grown through programs like the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">War </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n Wa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ste</span>. I'd like to make a special shout-out today to Stephen Oliver, the producer of that program, and his teamâ€”you've made a real difference in the Australian public's understanding and awareness of this issue. But the Australian government, on the other hand, hasn't. As with its approach to all major environmental issues, it has done virtually nothing to tackle plastic pollution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're currently having a Senate inquiry into the waste crisis in this country. I won't go into that yet. I'm chairing that inquiry. I'm optimistic that we'll get some really good recommendations to back up the <span style="font-style:italic;">Toxic </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ide</span> report on how industry and all Australians can make a difference in this respect. But we need the government to immediately respond to the Senate report and we need a threat abatement plan because, under EPBC law, marine plastics are classified as a threatening process. That threat abatement plan has not yet been released by the governmentâ€”another critical area where they've fallen short.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what the rest of the world is doing. Only last week at their recent summit we had the G7 leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and European Union sign a healthy oceans plastic charter. We've had the UN Environment Assembly pass at their December 2017 Nairobi meeting a resolution to tackle plastic waste and marine litter. We've had the UK and the EU trying to outdo each other. Both leaders are having a war on waste. They're taking each other on as to who can reduce single-use plastics the most. Where is Australia? We have not responded to any of these international developments. Australia is a nation girt by sea. Australians love the ocean. Why aren't we a world leader in taking on this most critical of issues? We have the scientists, we have the technology and we have the vested interest in healthy oceans. I think most Australians would be on board with some strong action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While plastic pollution needs local and international responses, I would like to raise here today that, if we really want to phase out single-use plastics and deal with the major issue that we have in our ocean pollution, we should look at a Montreal Protocol type agreement, which we know was successful in putting in the plan to phase out CFCs to save the ozone layer. We need to lead a collaborative international action, join the rest of the world and show leadership on this most critical of issues.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise to make a statement today on an issue that I've been quite passionate about since my election to this place a couple of years ago, and that's the issue of civics education, particularly for younger Tasmanians. It's something I've been doing a bit of work on in my home state, engaging with students from various schools across the state. As I've stated previously, it's something I'm committed to doing my bit to assist in, in spreading the word about the importance of engagement in and understanding of our democratic institutions, state, federal and local; why it's important to take advantage of the ability to participate in democracy; the role of government; and what having your say can actually do. That is the great thing about democracy in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things I've done in Tasmania is to sponsor a private scholarship for residents of a residential college in Hobart, Jane Franklin Hall, which is a great institution. That scholarship is aimed at supporting students who have an interest in governance, democracy and public administration. The funds that I contribute towards that go towards supporting the cost of living for students who want to do some work in this space. This year I was pleased to be able to award the scholarship to a young fellow by the name of Mr Perry Smith, who was awarded the scholarship because of his interest in politics and public administration. Perry has had a very positive experience. He's gained real insights, having served a small period of time in my office and participated in the work of an electorate office. As I'm sure all senators would agree, it's great to get people in to see what the offices of parliamentarians do and to get an understanding of the big issues we deal withâ€”the things we come here to debate but also the issues we work with members of the community on so people understand exactly what the role of a parliamentarian is. I look forward to working with Perry into the future on the piece of work I've asked him to undertake, something I'll be talking about in this place a little later on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing young people engaged in politics and in understanding the political process and the power that it has is something that, as I say, I'm very passionate about. It's my belief that civics education should be a part of every child's education, not just a tack-on and not just an elective that a teacher may or may not feel is important for their students to engage in. It is a bit ad hoc in Tasmania. There have been some classes that do it. Some schools have a great program of interaction and education in this space, but it's by no means across the board. I'm sure many of us have had an interaction with someone. You'll introduce yourself and say what you do, and they might ask, 'Well, what's a senator?' It's concerning when an Australian who's been voting for 20-odd years may not know what a senator isâ€”that it's a member of the Australian parliamentâ€”or what they do. I think that, given we have this wonderful thing called a democracy where we can all have our say and have an influence over the outcome of an election in the interests of what we believe is right or wrong, we should be educating people about what they're voting on. Of course, civics education helps educate our future leaders about engagement, about understanding issues and working with communities, and about understanding the power of a place like this and the other place, or whichever form of civic institution they wish to be engaged with.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had the good fortune and privilege of visiting two schools in Tasmania in the beautiful town of New Norfolk, just north of the city of Hobart. I was able to visit New Norfolk Primary School and Fairview Primary School, both schools that have civics engagement programs to varying degrees, in which I was pleased to be able to participate. I was pleased to come and talk to grade 5 and 6 students at New Norfolk Primary, as an extension to their civics education program, about the role of parliament, democracy and the history of our federation, and test them on their knowledge as well. I was impressed by the level of knowledge demonstrated in answer to many of those questions. It was also impressive to learn what issues were important to students in these schools. The issues raised were ones you would probably hear from older, voting-age adult Australians. They weren't about cartoons or comic books; they were issues such as a well-functioning health system, hospital waiting lists, a good standard of education, proper roads and highways, and law and order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not bad for a bunch of students who are nine-, 10- or 11-year-olds to identify issues like those as things they feel strongly about. Despite the fact that these students may not be as articulate or eloquent as someone who's 30, 40 or 50 years old, these students had a good handle on these important issues. I commend the school for having a civics education program to engage children on issues that are going to affect their futures, but it's also encouraging to see that households are taking these issues seriously. Dinner table conversations turn to issues like the ones the students identified. As I said, it's important because these children are our next generation of leaders and decision-makers. I can see that those students have a good handle on these issues, understand what needs to happen and have a great capacity to identify what's important to them. I thank the staff and the students I met with at New Norfolk Primary School for hosting me and engaging in civics education in this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following on from that my day only got better, because I went to Fairview Primary School, as I mentioned before, and was able to have a meeting with their student leadership group, generally focused on questions about the qualities of a good leader or a good representative. I wanted to understand what they believed the qualities of a good leader to be. They identified things like being an effective communicator, being able to listen and show empathy, and being a role model amongst your peers in your community by setting an example, caring and helping other people. While they were talking about those qualities in their context as student leaders, they also identified them as qualities that we as community leaders and as members of the Australian parliament should be emulating, and they are absolutely right. It was also a chance for them to ask a number of other questions about the role of a senator, how the Australian parliament worksâ€”and some personal questions: 'What does your family think about what you do? Do you see your kids?' One question caught me by surprise: 'Do you believe in unicorns?' They have challenged me to disprove that. I'm still working on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Urquhart:</span>
                  </a>  What did you tell them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                  </a>  I said that I remained to be convinced, Senator Urquhart, but we'll see. They've given me until the end of the year to get back to them on that one. There were questions about motivation: 'Why do you do what you do? Why do you engage?' That was the most interesting part of the conversation. I turned the question back on those student leaders at Fairview Primary: 'Why did you put your hands up to be student leaders? Why did you volunteer to be a leader of your year group or class?' It was interesting to understand their motivations. All of them fundamentally wanted to leave their school community, which has been a big part of their life for so long now, in a better place than when they arrived. They wanted to leave a project that would improve Fairview Primary for the year groups that come after them. I thought that was commendable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators or members often refer to similar motivations in first speeches or in interviews as to why they came to this place. Again, it's great to see young people highlighting what is effectively very selfless and community-minded motivation as the reason they would put their hands up to give up their lunchbreak to serve lunch to other kids, to come in early to help out with the breakfast club, to help out at the local nursing home, and things like that. It was wonderful to see that sort of selfless motivation. The student leadership group also talked about the wonderful project that they're doing for their year group, which I'm sure they'll be announcing to their peers in the near future. Again, it's about that legacy and making sure that the generations after them that come through that school have a better schooling experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, for me, it is really about seeing an improved and broader application of civics education in Australian schools. I'm pleased to see what New Norfolk Primary and Fairview Primary are doing, and I thank and commend the students for their engagement. But I would love to see more of it, and I'm hoping I'll see more of it in Tasmanian primary schools in the near future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I rise today to speak on the current state of the Australian music industry and the general decline of interest in and support for new Australian music in this great country. I recently came across an article in the paper which featured the Australian Top 40 music chart. I have to confess that I haven't been across the charts since the days of Molly Meldrum and <span style="font-style:italic;">Countdown</span>, so I decided to do a bit of research to see who some of these artists were and, I have to say, I was a bit surprisedâ€”in fact, I was quite shocked. Seventeen singles on the Australian Top 40 chart were from US rapper Post Malone. Upon having a closer look, I saw that only three artists out of the 40 were Australian: Kasey Chambers, Missy Higgins and the DMA'S. I thought to myself that that couldn't possibly be right. So I asked around and did some further research to try and understand why this is the case. I was horrified to find that most people who are in some way associated with the industry believe that lack of a collective reason to support new Australian music is at the heart of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This may come as a bit of a shock to most of you in this place, but I don't have a musical bone in my bodyâ€”I'm an old truckie after all, so that's fair enough! But I did grow up in the era of the hard rock pub bands of the seventies and the eighties. I was a long-haul truckie, driving between Perth and Darwin and to all ports in between for over 11 years. This meant that I had a heck of a lot of time on my hands, as I went through the years, to listen, firstly, to the radio, then to cassettes and then, in my later trucking years, to CDs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was in my truck, driving the length and breadth of this magnificent country, I used to think I could pull off a pretty good Bon Scott impersonation, and I still doâ€”I might do it for you later on tonight! Back then, if there was a radio station in range, you could hear the likes of Skyhooks, Sherbet, Renee Geyer, AC/DC, John Paul Young, Marcia Hines and many, many other legends of the Australian music industry. As the hundreds of thousands of miles clocked up, there was also AC/DC, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Australian Crawl, Rose Tattoo, Divinyls, INXS, Cold Chisel, The Angels, Men at Work, 1927, Kylie Minogue, Tina Arena and many, many more artists who contributed to the rich Aussie music heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I travelled the country, I used to see posters advertising the performances of those bands and performers in towns across our nation. Many of them became household names. Those bands were part of the fabric of Australia. They went out to conquer the world alongside our sporting teams, businesses, arts and cultural acts of the seventies and the eighties. Sadly, we are not seeing that anymore. Why aren't we hearing and seeing acts to replenish those household names? Bands and solo artists have contributed to the Australian musical identity and the economy in an enormous manner over the last 50 years, and we cannot afford to lose that status on the world stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the 17 singles from the US rapper versus three singles from Aussie artists on the Top 40 chart. It seems like the desire of all the corporate radio networks to expose any new Aussie music comes down to the competitiveness of the very much changed business in today's internet age, where music is delivered in many, many ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we sadly have no <span style="font-style:italic;">Countdown</span> anymore, maybe the government can give our artists a radio station that will play their music 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whether they be 16 or 60, regardless of their music styles. As all the corporate radio companies are calling out right now for licensing fee relief, I've got a suggestion for the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Arts, Senator Fifield. How about you provide that on the proviso that they must and must only play new Australian music? Think about that. The more you play, the less you pay. I bet London to a brick that that'll get the money men loving Aussie music again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to take this opportunity to call on all Australians to take a minute to email or call your local member of parliament to tell them, 'We want you to support our Aussie artists and new Aussie music.' The challenge goes out to Australia. Let our music and talent lead us to another great era for the Australian music industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to now move to my other favourite topic and I want to share with the chamber in the remaining minutes that I have an exciting project I have been working on for well over 18 months now. I had the opportunity through a very dear friend of mine, Mr Robbie Williams in Perth, a legend of the Australian music industry that goes back to the '70s with Michael Chugg, Michael Gudinski and others. Robbie asked me if I had heard of the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus, to which I replied, 'Absolutely not.' Robbie suggested I should probably Google it and meet him down at the Leopold Hotel in Bicton Sunday arvo at two o'clock for a cold one. And I did. This bus is an unbelievable state-of-the-art, not-for-profit mobile recording studio. But that's just the start of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to New York. It was arranged that I could meet up with the CEO and co-founder, Mr Brian Rothschild. I went to Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. I saw the bus. I got on the bus. I met with students who were on the bus playing their music. The whole concept is that schoolkids can get on the bus when the bus gets to their school. They can write a song, they can write stories and they can recordâ€”there are all the musical instruments thereâ€”and by two o'clock in the afternoon it's up on YouTube and the whole world can see what these kids have done. Brian gave me a bit of a surprise, because he had one Yoko Ono Lennon waiting. She wasn't waiting for meâ€”she was doing an interviewâ€”but I happened to be out the front like a schoolkid waiting to meet the great Yoko, and I did. I asked Yoko, if we could get a bus to Australia, if she would launch it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So my fingers are crossed that we can get this darn bus built. Talk has gone on too long now; it's time to deliver. It will prick your earsâ€”and a lot of people in this place know about it because I haven't shut up about itâ€”to hear that it will tour Australia. There is a budget put together, and we're off and running. I have recruited these musical legends Michael Chugg, Michael Gudinski and Mark Popeâ€”and Mark's resume is as long as Chuggie's and as long as Michael'sâ€”to work with us. But I also thought, 'I need to do this properly and I need to do it where it is apolitical and can deliver the best outcome for our kids in rural and regional Australia, giving our kids the opportunity to tell their stories, record their music, write their songs and anything else that goes with it.' That's before I start on cultural advantages that will come with this as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've joined up with another legendâ€”well, legend in his own lunchbox, but I say that quietly because he had a crack at me yesterday!â€”in Senator Barry O'Sullivan. I wanted to make this across the chamber. I went to Senator O'Sullivan because he is rural. I know his commitment to kids goes without saying. Senator O'Sullivan and I are working on this with Michael Chugg, Michael Gudinski, Mark Pope and, of course, Brian Rothschild in the US.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will have a lot more to say about the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus. I have put the proposal wide in this building. All we're asking for is a measly sum of money to build this magnificent project. We don't want anything else. The philanthropic and business worlds will fund this. There's a lot of talk going on. But I am putting the plea to the government for the price to build this bus, to get it rolling on the highways and the byways of Australia and to roll it out to our rural and regional communities to give the kids who live outside the cities a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get on this state-of-the-art bus and write, play and record their music. I have spent many, many days rolling through the Kimberley showing it to the kidsâ€”Aboriginal kids and non-Aboriginal kids. How they would love to have a bus like this coming through their communities; it's overwhelming. I have not had one negative word. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on that, my plea is out there to the government to get behind Senator O'Sullivan and me and to get behind our music legends, who are putting their hard-earned time into this project for free because they are passionate about it. As I said in the contribution that I made earlier: we cannot let the Australian music industry die. This is what we have done. For people of my ilk, it is criminal that we don't have <span style="font-style:italic;">Countdown</span> for Australian music. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I want to go back to question time yesterday when I put several questions to defence minister Payne, representing the latest Minister for Veterans' Affair, Darren Chester. He is probably the fourth or fifth in as many years. My question concerned the case of former paratrooper Martin Rollins. He withdrew from the military after suffering a spinal injury. I made the point that, as an election promise, I would not neglect country Victoria. So I make frequent trips to regional and rural areas to talk to the mayors, councillors and the local police officers, and I always make a point of going to the RSL club in time for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ode </span>and to talk to returned diggers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I did a Q&amp;A with 50 veterans at the Ballarat RSL and heard some horror stories, not about what happened overseas, not about what happened in the war zones where they put their lives on the line for their country, but about what happened after they got home, after they got back here. I told them the brutal truth about the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I told them they had to regard the DVA as the enemy, because it treats you as the enemy. The case of former paratrooper Martin Rollins is, sadly, a classic case; it's not an unusual one. This shameful episode over how this serviceman was treated was featured on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30 Report</span> the other night. They story claimed that DVA deliberately deleted an incapacity policy for self-employed vets so that the pen-pushers could deny the compensation claim of veteran Rollins, who had to retire as a paratrooper after damaging his spine. Yesterday, in question time, Senator Payne said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the Department of Veterans' Affairs itself denies the specific allegation that it removed or cancelled policies to deny veterans their lawful entitlements, and that was one of the aspects which was raised in the program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, somebody is telling porkies. Somebody in the department has misled Minister Payne. I don't say that lightly, because I have proof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2009 and 2010, Martin Rollins's lawyer wrote to the DVA eight times. The lawyer wanted his case resolved on the basis of the then current policy outlined in what is known as the Incapacity Handbook. After those eight letters, on 16 August, an internal email from Veterans' Affairsâ€”an incriminating, self-damning email, which I have seenâ€”was widely distributed. The email said: 'Following discussions with the business area, 12 July 2010, the Incapacity Handbook paragraph 32.3.5 has been amended to remove any reliance that Rollins or his representative could place on it for the purpose of his outstanding claim.' I have not only a copy of that email but the cc'd list. It was sent on 16 August and cc'd in with a DVA chief operating officer, the executive PA to the DVA Secretary, the national director of the legal section, the national director of DVA policy, one senior lawyer and, most telling, the manager of the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service. If the policy hadn't been 'removed' or 'cancelled', as the minister claimed in question time yesterday, why such a wide distribution list? It proves, despite the denial the department gave the defence minister for question time, that they did tamper with the Incapacity Handbook to thwart Mr Rollins's legitimate claim. Not only did they tactically delete part of the policy that would have helped the ex-serviceman but it gets worse. Over 10 years the DVA engaged three external law firms, the Government Solicitor and a forensic accountant to fight Martin Rollins's claim. You have to ask: how much did it cost the taxpayer to persecute and destroy the quality of life of a man whose only crime is that he served his country? In fact, during one meeting Mr Rollins asked one of these government outside lawyers how much they thought they'd been paid since it all started. He asked if it was over $100,000. They responded, 'Of courseâ€”probably much more.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of emails again, an email discovered by Rollins through FOI in 2008 openly called Mr Rollins's incapacity 'debatable', suggesting that he could have been faking it and feigning injury. The man has a shattered L5 disc in his back. Centrelink did the same calculation as the veterans' affairs department, and they came to the conclusion that Rollins was entitled to financial assistance based on his incapacity. It took them just 14 days in July 2010. Centrelink told Rollins they were baffled that his case was taking so long at Veterans' Affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This treatment of a struggling ex-serviceman, in my view, was despicable and unconscionable. For the DVA to be still trying to pull the wool over a defence minister's eyes and trying to publicly whitewash despicable, vengeful behaviour, I believe, is truly appalling. Sometimes you wonder if public servants in that department even know that the V in DVA stands for 'veterans'. As I told those veterans in Ballarat, to get anywhere you must treat the DVA as the enemy, because they regard you as the enemy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a final indicative point: Martin Rollins didn't want this to become a story. He says 'I was just incapacitated. I was just reaching out for help.' And the DVA was not there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Freedom is a basic principle of the political party I support, the Liberal National Party of Queensland. It is also an underlying principle of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party. We believe in freedom, in individual freedom, in self-responsibility, in the family and in support for the disadvantaged. Freedom is one of our underlying basic tenets. I thought freedom was also a basic core value of universities around the world. I thought universities welcomed differences of opinion, debate and views that may not be popular and which may not be the majority views. I thought they welcomed different views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I have been distressed over the last year about a university which I always praise and which I call 'my' university, although I was never able to afford to go there or clever enough to get a scholarship there back in the early days. That's James Cook University in North Queensland, which has done a wonderful job in many fields. It has wonderful campuses in Townsville, Cairns and Singapore, and generally it is a university I support very strongly and enthusiastically. But I have to say that I have been concerned at the way James Cook University has treated a couple of academics who didn't agree with the normal view accepted by perhaps the majority of scientists on climate change and on the Great Barrier Reef. I am clearly not a scientist, and I can't go into the scientific differences, but I did appreciate that there were different views from two very distinguished scientists, the late Professor Bob Carter and Professor Peter Ridd. Professor Carter was an adjunct professor at the university and had a different view on climate change, and he, to my way of seeing the issue, was forced out of James Cook University because he had a view that didn't fit the norm of most scientists. I spoke to Professor Carter before his death. His basic principle, his basic argument, was about accepting that climate change is happening and we should be focusing our attention not on more research on why it happened but on rehabilitationâ€”in dealing with the impacts of climate change. He is a very sensible man, a very learned scientist, in my view, but he effectively was forced out of James Cook University.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is Professor Peter Ridd, who has a different view on the Great Barrier Reef, a view I might say that I, as a non-scientist, share, because I have lived adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef all of my life. I have to say that most of the constituents along the Great Barrier Reef that I represent also agree with Professor Peter Ridd, not from a scientific viewpoint but from their own observations over a lifetime. Yet, Professor Ridd was eventually sacked by James Cook University. I wrote to the learned vice-chancellor, Professor Sandra Hardingâ€”a good friend of mineâ€”on 30 August last year expressing my concerns about what I understood to be the situation relating to Professor Ridd. As I indicated in that letter to Professor Harding, I didn't have all of the facts, but it seemed to me that this was a case of disciplining a scientist who didn't agree with other scientists at JCU and at the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Professor Harding wrote back to me and explained that that wasn't the reason Professor Ridd was being disciplined. It was about personal behaviour and not questioning the veracity of another researcher's science. According to news reports he did make some comments about work done by Professor Terry Hughes from James Cook University, who is always out there following, or perhaps leading on, the Greens political party lines on all of the horrors that are happening on the Great Barrier Reef, when other researchers, like Professor Ridd, and people who are on the reef all the time, like the constituents I serve, would have thought that Professor Hughes's comments were slightly over the top, to put it politely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, Peter Ridd has now separated from the university and I think it is a great shame that, whether or not it is true, the perception is that James Cook University, which I love and support all the time, has disciplined two distinguished scientists because they didn't agree with the mob-thought on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef. As Peter McCutcheon said in an interview on the ABC, 'The former professor's crime was to speak disparagingly of his colleagues, who found that the Great Barrier Reef was in peril because of farming run-off and climate change.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that it is strange to be a bedfellow of the National Tertiary Education Union, but I agree with Mr Andrew Bonnell from the union, who said: 'The fundamental issue is that academic freedom is indivisible and you can't have academic freedom for people you agree with and not for people you disagree with.' Peter Ridd was asked whether his view was a minority view and he correctly said, 'Yes, absolutely it is, but science isn't a democracy. It is not the most votes; it is who has got the evidence.' Peter Ridd's complaint about some scientific work on the Great Barrier Reef is that it is not peer reviewed and not properly peer reviewed. He is concerned, as he said in a note to me, that his focus was on calling for better quality assurance for any science upon which the government based big spending decisions. 'Presently, so much of this science is never properly checked, despite what science organisations may claim to the contrary. The fact that they do not accept that we have a quality problem is worse than the bad science they often produce.' For those comments Professor Ridd is no longer there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that I don't agree with everything that Professor Ridd said. In fact, he criticises, in some media outlets, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which I think is a quality organisation of very, very good scientists, and my understanding, limited as it is, is that on many issues they don't altogether disagree with Professor Ridd. So I'm very disappointed that the university I love and support has been tagged as being anti freedom to express these views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time left available to me, I also want to mention the Australian National University and the way they've handled the bequest of money to set up a degree course in Western civilisation. The ridiculous comments we've had in relation to the rejection by ANU of that bequest are quite frightening. It was apparently rejected by ANUâ€”and, of course, the chancellor there is Gary Evans, the former federal Labor minister, who, when he was here, called himself Gareth Evansâ€”who, along with the Australian National University Students Association and the National Tertiary Education Union, said the program would push a racist or radically conservative agenda. Well, even if it did, you'd think that in a university they'd be able to handle that and have arguments against it. Of course, as the organisation looking after that bequest indicated, this wasn't about any sort of racist issue on Western civilisation but about our modern society and how we should look to the foundations of our society. I conclude by quoting the Minister for Education and Training, Simon Birmingham, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is essential that universities are not only open to but enthusiastic about the study of the values that helped to create both them and the modern society in which we now enjoy unparalleled opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I hope that other universities in discussions with the Ramsay Centre resist ill-informed or politically correct objections and find a way to ensure this generous bequest enables valuable study into the foundations of our society.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I want to use my time in senators' statements for the very practical purpose of alerting working families who rely on child care that the system is about to change and their payments may well be at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To anybody listening, I want to place on record my serious concerns about the Turnbull government's changes to our childcare system. Putting aside the fact that thousands of vulnerable Australians will be worse off after 1 Julyâ€”and I'll come back to thatâ€”Labor is worried that the way in which the changes are being implemented will cause hardship for families around the country. The onus has been placed squarely on parents and caregivers to contact Centrelink to transition to the new system, and the government has largely left it to childcare centres to follow up with families and support them through the transition. Unfortunately, despite the good work of thousands of proactive centres across Australia, we know that hundreds of thousands of families are yet to complete the new paperwork. The minister tried to dress up these numbers in this place yesterday, talking about how many families have signed up, but he failed to mention that 23 per cent of families, or around 275,000â€”that's around one in fourâ€”are yet to sign up and the deadline is imminent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean for families? Parents and caregivers who have not yet transitioned should urgently visit the my.gov.au website or visit a local Centrelink office. Unfortunately, those who fail to complete the new paperwork risk losing their subsidies from 1 July. Of course, it will be the childcare facilities who have to pick up the pieces, dealing with confused and anxious familiesâ€”families who can't afford to pay their bills and may not understand whyâ€”or, worse, dealing with families who don't realise their subsidy has been cut until their childcare fees are direct debited that week, families who live pay cheque to pay cheque, where every dollar counts. Without a subsidy, those families may see their grocery money disappear and be left with literally nothing to live on. I'm very worried about the impact of these changes on families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't believe the government have done enough to support families through this transition. As I said, they've essentially left it to childcare operators to tell families about the changes, and we've heard nothing from the government on how long it will take Centrelink to process each family's transition. Given the blowout in Centrelink payment processing times, the wait times on phone calls and the volumes of calls that simply go unanswered, I am not brimming with confidence about families getting timely results from Centrelink under a coalition government ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I return now to the issue of families that will be disadvantaged by the Turnbull government's changes. Under these changes, access to early childhood education will be cut for around one in four families across the country. Access will be cut for over 62,000 families in Queensland alone. Amanda Rishworth, Labor's shadow minister for early childhood education and development, was in Queensland recently, and I thank her for visiting my duty electorate of Petrie. Unfortunately, I was required in Canberra for estimates that week, so I sent my apologies to the Goodstart Early Learning centre in Rothwell. I thank them very much for hosting the shadow minister and our federal Labor candidate for Petrie, Corinne Mulholland. I look forward to visiting one of the great Goodstart centres across Petrie at another time in the future, but I know Corinne Mulholland has been very active in campaigning against these Liberal and National cuts, and she's out there every day talking with local mums and dads about the affordability and accessibility of our childcare system, while the Liberal member for Petrie stays silent on the issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a very proud record when it comes to supporting parents back into the workforce and advancing early childhood education. We have a proud record of making child care more affordable to parents and caregivers. It was the Whitlam government who took on the implementation of the Child Care Act 1972, and in 1974 the Whitlam government broadened funding to include preschools and childcare support for all families, not just for the poor. I note the assertions by Brennan and Wales and by Brennan and Adamson quoted by Sumsion et al in an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australasian Journal of Early Childhood</span> in December 2013:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Both the Act and the Whitlam era â€¦ have been identified as a 'turning point' in childcare politics â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, from 1983 to 1987 under the Hawke Labor government, the Commonwealth worked with states and territories to expand the childcare system, together with funding capital development and around 20,000 places. In 1984 childcare assistance was introduced and a more needs-based planning approach to places adopted. In 1986 Labor put caps on fees that facilities could charge, and in 1988 the National Childcare Strategy was announced, aimed at providing an extra 30,000 childcare places. In our last term of government we raised the cap on the childcare rebate, enabling more parents and caregivers to participate more fully in the workforce without being penalised by fees and facilitating more time for parents to look for work or study.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also proud of the fact that Labor works hand in hand with the union movement to fight for fairer wages and good conditions for early childhood workers and educators. I want to particularly acknowledge the efforts by the Big Steps campaign run by United Voice, pushing for fair pay for fair work by workers in childcare facilities across the country. My wife re-entered the workforce when our kids were young. As a father of four, I note that we could not have achieved all that we have achieved in our family without the support of early childhood educators. We entrust our children to these workers in some of their most formative developmental years. We know the transformative power that educationâ€”even just regular readingâ€”provides for our children. Labor recognises that quality early education and care can only be provided by a skilled, professional and well-paid workforce. We don't think it is right that those who educate our youngest minds earn less than half the national average wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, right now big-business profits are hitting record highs, but workers' wages are standing still. Inequality is increasing, and the gender gap has never been more obvious. The ABC reported earlier this month that, for the first time in recorded history, less than half of all working Australians have a permanent full-time job with leave entitlements. Cost-of-living pressures are hurting families, and Labor recognises that it can be an incredibly difficult decision for families weighing up the pros and cons of returning to work and putting a child into care. We have heard information about effective marginal tax rates in the past couple of weeks in the debate about personal income tax cuts. We have heard about how the cost of child care contributes to effective marginal tax rates and can act as a significant disincentive to parents re-entering the workforce. Yet this government does nothing to address these issues, and it has form when it comes to neglecting issues facing our early education workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion: the government have done a number of things. They've allowed the Early Years Workforce Strategy to expire, abolished the Long Day Care Professional Development Program and ended funding for professional support coordinators. Now they're cutting access to early childhood education and care for some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable parents and children in the country. The last thing we should do for these families is further entrench the cycle of disadvantage, but that's exactly what the Liberals and Nationals are doing. Now more than ever we need a federal Labor government to support families and children by getting the policy settings right. Labor will make sure that early childhood education takes priority over tax cuts to big business. Labor will make sure our educators and our workers are valued. Labor will ensure that our childcare system supports our most vulnerable children and families to reap the benefits that we know early childhood education can offer.</span>

I can only speak as to when I was informed, and it was late last night. The decision by Telstra to restructure its workforce over the next three years is a disappointing one for those affected by it, but ultimately it is a commercial decision for Telstra. The government recognises the imperative of helping individuals and communities adapt to change. When job losses occur, our first concern is for the workers and their families who are affected by the job losses. I have spoken to Telstra, as I understand has the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, and I understand that a number of the job losses will be through voluntary redundancies. The government is pleased to see that Telstra will establish a $50 million transition program to assist its workers who will lose their jobs, or need to reskill, over the next three years as part of Telstra's restructure. Telstra recognises the importance of supporting its skilled and knowledgeable workforce as they transition to new jobs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a number of measures to assist displaced workers to transition and return to the workplace. These include employment assistance through jobactive for eligible displaced workers, including funds to assist with retraining, wage subsidies and, if needed, relocation assistance. We also have support through our vocational education and training system. We also have income support and financial counselling services provided by the Department of Human Services. Australia's healthy economy, social safety nets and strength in education and skills training gives usâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'd ask you this: why is the coalition government making it harder for Australians to look to education and train themselves for the jobs of the future by cutting $2.2 billion from Australian universities and around $3 billion from vocational education? Doesn't this just show how arrogant and out of touch this Prime Minister is when the best he can doâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

To quote a phrase, 'Yet another lot of Labor lies.' Senator Carr, you are completely wrong in what you have stated. This government is focused on backing our businesses, because, as we know, when we back our businessesâ€”and we can do that through tax cutsâ€”our businesses will reinvest that money back into themselves, and they will prosper and they will grow. This government has a good record of job creation. If we look at just over the last 12 months, in excess of 178,000 full-time jobs were created because of the policy settings of the Turnbull government. Compare that to the final 12 months of the former Labor government. You'd never know, would you, colleagues, that the economy shed almost 17,000 full-time jobs under the policies that those on the other side put in place.</span>

This year's budget continues the coalition government's record investment in nation-building infrastructure projects, in roads, in rail and in airports. These projects are job-creating superchargers to the economy. We're going to take Australians off the misery of welfare and into the dignity of work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is investing $75 billion in a decade-long pipeline of transport infrastructure. Inland Rail and the Western Sydney Airport are the sorts of nation-changing, family-opportunity-providing infrastructure projects that have not been attempted before. These new investments will collectively support around 50,000 direct and indirect jobs, particularly in regional and rural areas. People in regional and remote areas are going to be beneficiaries of the $3.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, which is going to lift productivity on our regional freight roads. We're also investing an additional $160 million in the Outback Way, making it a total commitment of $330 million to the project. This is a decade-long pipeline of investment, giving certainty to businesses. They know what they're looking forward to. With this investment, the economy has created over 100,000 jobs in the last year. That's 1,100 jobs a day, 1,100 more families with a principal breadwinner.</span>

As we continue to strengthen our budget position, we can invest in Australian families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They are going to relieve congestion, grow the region and connect businessesâ€”something that those opposite may not understand and clearly haven't done anything about in the past. We're investing $15.5 billion in funding transport infrastructure projects in Queensland and $5.2 billion in major projects in Queensland, including $1 billion for the upgrade of two sections of the M1 Pacific Motorway, from Varsity Lakes to Tugun and Eight Mile Plains to Daisy Hill; $390 million for the Beerburrum to Nambour Rail Upgrade, which we're still waiting on the Queensland government to match; $300 million for the Brisbane Metro project; and an additional $3.3 billion for projects on the Bruce Highway to improve safety and create jobs. There is $223 million for 10 projects in Queensland and $56 million for the North Australia Program.

There's only one party you can trust to keep the budget under control. If the budget isn't under control, you can't make the sorts of investments in infrastructure and job creation that we're making. The Deception Bay Road interchange upgrade, which the people of Longman have been calling for, can be delivered because we've done such a great job of getting the budget under control so we can invest in such important infrastructure projects. The $120 million Commonwealth commitment to a six-lane overpass is going to increase safety, reduce travel times and connect Longman with other parts of Queensland. It is going to bring prosperity to Longman. This is part of the coalition's record $10 billion commitment to communities along the Bruce Highway. The people of Longman will benefit from the $1.4 billion Pine River to Caloundra Road Interchange upgrade. They could never have benefited if the coalition hadn't got the budget under control so they could invest in the people of Longman. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In question time yesterday the Prime Minister's advice to a 60-year-old aged-care worker in Burnie who will be only $10 a week better off under his government's personal income tax plan was, 'Get a better job'. Why does the Prime Minister think that an investment banker from Rose Bay is better than an aged-care worker from Burnie?</span>

Under our long-term plan to provide income tax relief for families a 60-year-old aged care worker in Tasmania will in fact get a tax cut before anybody else. The second thing I would say is that, on this side of the chamber, we have the great aspiration that all Australians of any age in any profession should have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. Not only do we want to leave them with more of their own money by providing them with a tax cut now but we also want them to have the incentive to pursue a career, get ahead and pursue other job opportunities. We are not as ageist as the Labor Party, who suggest that somebody at 60 years of age is unable to go into a better-paid job if that is what they want to do. We want anyone who is working hard in a job they enjoy to have more of their own money. We don't want them to go backwards as a result of bracket creep. We don't want them to be pushed into higher income tax brackets because of inflation. That is why we are pursuing our long-term plan for income tax relief, but we also want to ensure that all working Australians of any age have the right incentive, the right encouragement and the right reward for effort so they have the best possible opportunity to get ahead.</span>

Minister, I refer you to the case of a 63-year-old Hazara man who sought asylum in Australia and is currently being held by your government on Nauru. This man is currently dying of lung cancer and needs palliative care which cannot be provided in Nauru. Why is it that your government is refusing to allow this man, who is dying as we speak, to receive the palliative care that he so desperately needs in Australia?</span>

As I indicated before, I'm not aware of the particular case to which Senator McKim refers. Regardless, it is not the practice to comment on individual and specific cases. Medical transfer decisions occur on a case-by-case basis according to clinical need, in consultation with the contracted health services provider and the government of Nauru. Australia has provided significant funding and support over a number of years to improve the health infrastructure in Nauru, but that is as far as I can take this.</span>

I'm very pleased that that trade is effectively out of business. We've got to make sure that that trade remains out of business, and that can be secured by ensuring that we maintain the effort, which we are under this government, and that we do not give the opportunity to others in this place who would seek to dismantle those arrangements and see the people smugglers back in business and people put in harm's way.</span>

As Australians would know, the Turnbull government is creating a stronger economy. That's what we're all about.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we were elected in September 2013, the economy under this government has now created in excess of one million jobs. But we know that there is still more to do, and that is why the Turnbull government is focused on the creation of new growth industries. For the first time in Australia's history, the government is establishing a national space agency which will officially commence in less than two weeks. The global space economy is worth around US$345 billion. Australia's share currently is approximately 0.8 per cent of that. Australia, however, has immense capabilities when it comes to space-related sectors. We lead the world in automated mining and precision agriculture. We have excellent capability in advanced manufacturing, including in satellites, and we're recognised for our expertise in satellite navigation, data analysis and research. But what we've lacked to date is a single body that coordinates our domestic activity but also provides a pathway to international participation. We are creating such a body.</span>

It's a fact not recognised by some that, since the 1950s space race, the space industry itself has totally transformed. What was once strictly the domain of government is now a flourishing private market with far lower barriers to entry. The global market is now filled with businesses: large businesses and small businesses but especially those dealing with satellite technology, which is a particular strength of Australia's. The transformation of the space economy and the opportunities that this transformation presents for Australians are why the Turnbull government has created the Australian Space Agency. Our industries already have the requisite capabilities. It now means that they can participate on the global stage and create jobs for Australians.</span>

Our investment in Australian space industry jobs is another example of how we are stimulating businesses to grow and create more jobs. Like so many, I have been encouraged by the tremendous response the announcement of Australia's space agency has received. Last week I met with the head of space systems at Airbus. This is what he had to say: 'Australia's investment is allowing the country to grow and take advantage of the talented space industry which has made Australia's space economy the fastest growing on the planet.' And Christyl Johnson, the deputy director of technology and research at NASA, had said, 'We are allowing Australians to step up and join NASA's activities on the global stage.' This is an investment that will transform the industry landscape in Australia and create new jobs for generations to come.</span>

Is it not the case that, at estimates, your department testified that the design and build of 12 submarines by Naval Group will cost the taxpayer $50 billion on a constant price basis? What assurances can the minister give to the Senate that the acquisition cost of the Future Submarines will be no more than $50 billion? And what measures are in place to try to reduce the cost of that figure if possible?</span>

We did discuss at estimates the Future Submarine program, in broad terms, and some commentary around that. I note that we are doubling the size of Australia's submarine fleet, and I do refute much of the commentary that has been made on this matter. When we explained it at Senate estimates we talked about the 2016 Integrated Investment Program, which the Prime Minister and I released in February of that year, which stated that the acquisition cost of the Future Submarine capability is estimated at greater than $50 billion out turned. As has been explained, the current estimate is $50 billion in constant dollars. Self-evidently, particularly given the strength of the Australian dollar, of the Australian economy, if you out-turn $50 billion in today's dollars it will be greater than $50 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note that the acquisition costs for the Future Submarine include much more than the design and construction of the submarine itself. As well as the design and construction of a fleet of 12 submarines, doubling the size, it includes the cost of designing and integrating the combat system into the 12 submarines, the investment in science and technology that will be required, the delivery of logistics support that will be required, and the design and construction of the submarine yard and the other land based facilities that will be required to support it, which I note are at Osborne in South Australia, which one presumes Senator Patrick welcomes. The initial estimate of the costs as set out in the IIP I have explained to the chamber, and I'm of course happy to take Senator Patrick's further questions.</span>

I don't intend to release them publicly. I don't intend to undermine our own reputation as a credible and trustworthy customer. In any case, both the acquisition and sustainment cost estimates for the Future Submarine program will, of course, continue to be refined as the design of the Future Submarine continues. It's the case that more accurate estimates will become available after the critical design review, and that is scheduled to take place in 2022.</span>

As we indicated in the defence white paper and as we set out in the Integrated Investment Program, we made a very careful assessment through a force structure review process and the preparation of the defence white paper of the capability that needed to be acquired to ensure the Australian Defence Force is equipped to do the job we ask them to do. In naval capability there was a significant challenge, as Senator Patrick will be aware, because no work had been done on that. Not one single order had been placed and not one single vessel had been commissioned for the entire term of the previous Labor government. So we had a very significant task ahead of us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is exciting today that Genex Power has announced to the market that it has received an indicative term sheet from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility for a $516 million concessional loan to support the very large investment in energy in Far North Queensland at the former Kidston mine site. That project includes investments in pumped hydro, solar and wind which will create secure supplies for North Queensland. It will create 500 jobs in the construction phase. We very much welcome the strong commitment the NAIF has provided here and wish Genex all the best for the future of the project.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should point out that the term sheet is conditional on a number of things, including agreements on the offtake of power and further equity discussions that Genex will try to progress this year. But this is a major project. Earlier this year, I announced changes to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility's mandate. The announcement of the term sheet today is a direct result of those changes to provide the NAIF greater flexibility to make offers of this kind. I look forward to working with Genex, the NAIF and the Queensland government to progress these very important projects for North Queensland to secure their energy supplies and to provide hope for economic development and jobs, too.</span>

We've put $100 million into 18 beef roads right across northern Australia. This is specifically targeted at saving the beef industry money. About 30 per cent of the cost of a steak, which you might order at the pub tonight or later this week, comes from transport costs. The more we can bring those down, the better for beef producers and the better for consumers too. That is reflected in the comments of beef producers. Clancy Middleton, a cattle producer in North Queensland, says: 'As producers, we've been on our knees in North Queensland. The sealing of these roads is a cost saving on average of $3.13 a head, and we move about 1.5 million head of cattle across this region. That puts nearly $5 million back into the pockets of farmers and businesses in the north.' This is a very important program that we are building upon. It's great to see it delivering benefits for the agricultural industry in the north.</span>

We are building on those investments we've already made in beef roads and northern Australian roads. In Western Australia I recently announced an additional $160 million to continue to seal the Outback Way. We've made a commitment to seal the Outback Way over the next decade. That's a stretch of road from Winton in western Queensland through to Laverton in Western Australia. Once it is sealed it will be only the third sealed route across our continent. It's a big country. It's great to see us investing in projects that help develop and connect our nation east-west, not just north-south.</span>

I know that there are many people and councils here this week for their national conference who are very excited about these projects. We will continue to work with northern Australians for many years to help that part of the country.</span>

The government expects a $3.7 billion boost to revenue from tobacco excise and customs duty over the next four years under its measure to combat illicit tobacco. Much of this revenue boost occurs in 2019-20, when the government will start taxing tobacco as it enters warehouses rather than when it leaves. This will bring forward revenue. Roughly what proportion of the $3.7 billion boost over four years is attributable to this change in the point at which tobacco is taxed? Can you please explain how this change in the taxing point can have a significant effect over the next four years, given that the average time that tobacco remains in warehouses is only a matter of weeks?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:38</span>):  I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for that question. The government is indeed introducing a package of measures, including additional enforcement resources, to combat the illicit tobacco trade and protect the integrity of Australia's tobacco excise system. The package of measures will address this tax gap, promote the health of Australians by supporting the existing tobacco control policies and remove a key source of funding for organised crime. These measures will protect the sustainability and integrity of the tax base and will ensure that everyone pays their fair share, which will enable the government to keep taxes as low as possible, reducing the burden on the legitimate law-abiding economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The package is estimated to have a net gain to the budget of $3.6 billion over the current forward estimates periods, and a large proportion of the revenue impact is due to moving the taxing point for tobacco to the border to eliminate leakage from licensed warehouses. That is the integrity measure. Rather than collect the tax at a later stage, we'll collect the tax at the border. Changing the taxing point does result in tobacco duty being collected earlier than it otherwise would have been, bringing additional revenue into the current forward estimates period. This includes a one-off boost to revenue in the first year of the measure, as all stock held in warehouses as at 1 July 2019 becomes liable for duty and revenue is received from new tobacco imports due to the earlier taxing point.</span>

I say this because the budget boosts spending on tobacco law enforcement by $136 million, and this would be unjustified if it didn't generate as least as much revenue. </span>

Australia is of course very committed to supporting a secure and stable Pacific. We are strengthening our engagement through a number of initiatives, as I know the Minister for International Development and the Pacific is well aware. From a defence perspective, our Joint Task Group Indo-Pacific Endeavour 18 is a current major maritime activity that reflects our commitment to deepen our engagement and our partnerships with regional security forces in the Pacific through both dialogue and practical activities. The backbone of IPE 2018 is HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide</span>, our LHD, the frigates HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Toowoomba</span> and the supply ship HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Success</span>. As well as those ships' companies we also have embarked on the ships an Australian Army team from 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and other support personnel from Navy and Air Force, which is a total of around 1,200 members. In addition, there are a number of international defence members, including marines from Marine Rotational Force-Darwin, and Sri Lankan marines as well. So far, IPE 2018 has visited Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu and they have undertaken some very practical activities with their counterparts. To give a couple of examples, in Vanuatu the task force delivered supplies to meet the needs of people who had been displaced by volcanic activity on Ambae Island.

It is not just in the Pacific that we are increasing our defence engagement. Across more than a dozen engagements at the Shangri-La Dialogue I noted repeatedly that we are engaging with nations small and large, both bilaterally and in smaller groupings, to strengthen the cohesion of nations that share our vision for the region, that contribute to security and stability in our region. Whether it's through training, through exercises, through educational opportunities or through improved information-sharing, we are always looking at ways to build on our capacity and our interoperability across the Indo-Pacific. We are providing practical support wherever we can, as requested by our partners. I think the best current example of that is the government's assistance to the government of Papua New Guinea for their hosting of APEC meetings in November of this year. We work closely with our partners across the region, particularly on counterterrorism, and specifically with the Philippines, with Indonesia, with Malaysia and with Singapore to address that continuing threat.</span>

There's one very timely example of our ability to work closely with our partners, which is built on a foundation of shared interests and values and of people-to-people links that have been established over decades. Next week, Australia and Malaysia will mark the 60th anniversary of Australia's presence at the Royal Malaysian Air Force Base Butterworth. Generations of ADF members have lived and worked at Butterworth, including my own partner's parents, with their two young sons for a period. Many have built important bonds with their Malaysian counterparts. Around 100 former ADF personnel are expected to attend next week's celebration, which is a mark of the very special place that Butterworth holds in the hearts and minds of many Australians. The longevity of that engagement and our presence there at Butterworth testifies to Malaysia's and Australia's shared interests and also to both nations' commitment to regional stability. These are very important relationships on which we continue to build.</span>

Mr Ebeid said, and I think this is a self-evident point: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ sports rights have been going up and up and up. The World Cup was no different â€“ we've paid a lot more for the World Cup and at the same time our costs for the World Cup have gone up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are I guess what might be considered some self-evident observations. He also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So at the end of the day you have to cut your cloth to suit your own funding. One of the things we wanted to make sure was that we retained the World Cup for our viewers â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In reference to the arrangements that SBS entered into, he went on to say, 'It helped us financially. It gave us more product, more games in terms of the EPL, and it allowed us to still have all the main games of the World Cup, so a good deal overall. And, as I say, it enabled us to retain the World Cup where we may not have been able to afford to do it on our own.' So I thought that those might be some helpful comments from the MD of SBS, for colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Ebeid also went on to say: 'SBS is limited in things like its advertising revenue, so we can only go to a maximum of five minutes an hour, compared to our commercial counterparts, which probably do 13 to 15 minutes. So our ability to monetise is restricted by our ability to increase our revenue, which is hamstrung. So we had to adjust our spend accordingly.' On this side of the chamber, we had a proposition before the Senate to give the SBS greater flexibility when it came to advertising. Those opposite opposed that. So Mr Ebeid made the clear point that greater advertising flexibility would have assisted them in precisely this sort of circumstance.</span>

I'm not blaming SBS. I am blaming those opposite. We wanted to give the SBS greater advertising flexibility. Those opposite said, 'No, no, no, no, no; we won't let that happen.' I don't know if those opposite are suggesting that that particular matter be revisited. It's one that we've taken off the table, but perhaps Senator Farrell might like to clarify if he is proposing that that which Mr Ebeid referred to be revisited.</span>

What a great thing it is that SBS will be broadcasting free to air the World Cup final. On this side of the chamber we think that's a good thing. Obviously, we are aware of the technical difficulties that Optus has had, and SBS and Optus have worked together to ensure that there's even more that is being broadcast free to air. So I would ask for Senator Farrell to reflect on his contribution today.</span>

This is, of course, a groundbreaking reform which is improving outcomes for Australians with a significant and permanent disability, and the Turnbull government is committed to delivering for the Australian people. Every dollar and every cent this government committed to delivering the National Disability Insurance Scheme remains in place and always will.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Stoker asks for an update. On 31 March this year, the NDIS quarterly report showed solid progress in line with expectations. In total, more than 160,000 Australians are now benefitting from the NDIS, and this includes more than 10,000 children who have been supported through the scheme's Early Childhood Early Intervention gateway. We're seeing benefits all around Australia. But let me take you, Senator Stoker, to Queensland. In Queensland over 14,500 people have already accessed the NDIS, and this number will increase. At the full rollout in 2020, over 95,000 people are expected to be receiving life-changing support. In an electorate like Longman, it is expected that over 4,100 Australians will receive support through the NDIS when it is rolled out. Importantly, under this government Australians can be assured that their government is absolutely committed to funding the NDIS.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that is in direct contrast to those opposite, who failed to fund the NDIS through a formal mechanism. They failed to put in place a formal mechanism that would assist Australians with a disability.</span>

This is an important investment that will help raise awareness of NDIS job opportunities and overcome market barriers. It will also combat service difficulties in rural and remote areas and help businesses to grow and develop. I'm advised that activities funded through the jobs and market fund will include things like work to support the development of an e-marketplace, online training modules for NDIS workers, support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to become NDIS registered providers, workshops to inform school leavers about NDIS career opportunities and projects to develop new service delivery models.</span>

The good news from the Turnbull government's rollout of a fully funded NDIS scheme is that all Australians are going to get a benefit. In addition to Australians receiving increased services or supports, the good news is that some Australians are now receiving life-changing support for the first time. In fact, there are 45,000 great examples of Australians getting these supports for the first time. This means 45,000 Australians getting the reasonable and necessary supports they need to live a better life. Often this is not just the person receiving the benefit; it's also their communities and their families. The NDIS is one of the most important social policy innovations that have been developed and implemented in Australian history, and the Turnbull government is delivering thisâ€”unlike those opposite.</span>

                  </a>  we are committed to delivering income tax relief to hardworking families and we want the government's long-term plan to be legislated in full and unamended. Earlier today the Senate decided to move an amendment to our bill for providing income tax relief to hardworking families. That means, in order for us to deal conclusively with this bill this week, it needs to go back to the House of Representatives and it needs to have time to come back to the Senate for final determination.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, we've had some debate on this now. The truth is that we could have debate on this for another couple of weeks. That would not change the mind of the Labor Party, it would not change the mind of the Greens and it would not change the mind of Senator Storer. Everybody knows what their position is in relation to this bill. Obviously, we have taken into account the feedback that we've received from senators across the chamber. There was no appetite for extended hours tonight and there was no appetite for extended hours tomorrow, so there is only one way we can deal with the bill this week, given that it has to go back to the House of Representatives, where the government will not be supporting the amendment that was passed by the Senate. The only way we can deal with this efficiently this week so that we can provide certainty to hardworking families around Australia about the income tax relief that they deserve is by now moving this motion in the terms that have been circulated in the chamber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is about to stand up and be completely outraged about what the government is doing here. She, of course, was part of a government that moved motions to limit debate or guillotine or gag debate on no fewer than 188 occasionsâ€”including 53 times in one week! The Labor Party government that Senator Wong was a party to, the government that Senator Wong was a senior minister in, gagged debate on 188 occasions and gagged debate on 53 occasions in one week. Many of their bills were passed without any debate at all, supported by the Greens. I remember when Senator Bob Brown, the then leader of the Greens, participated in the first gag.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that this is a very important economic reform. This is a very important reform for working families around Australia. This is about the government, the Senate and the parliament as a whole making sure that working families around Australia can keep more of their own money, don't go backwards and are not on the receiving end of bracket creep. We have the opportunity to legislate in full this week the seven-year long-term plan that the government announced in the budget for working families. I call on all senators who support this personal income tax cut getting legislated this week. I call on all senators who want to see working families around Australia keep more of their own money so that low- and middle-income earners can have some relief from cost-of-living pressures and so that all working Australians get the right incentive, the right encouragement and the right reward for effort to ensure that they are not on the receiving end of bracket creep and there is not this drag on economic growth moving forward that comes with bracket creep. I call on every senator who supports this bill and supports the efficient passage of this bill through the parliament as a whole to support this suspension and to support the procedural motions that will follow so that the Senate can deal with this bill conclusively today so it can go back to the House of Representatives, where the government will reject the amendment that was passed by the Senate this morning, and so that the Senate has the opportunity to conclusively deal with this bill here in the Senate tomorrow so we can all go home this weekend, having delivered for working families around Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  Not happy in failing in their attempt to hold the tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners hostage to the tax cuts for high-income earners, what we now see are a government spitting the dummy and not even allowing debate in the Senate chamber. How pathetic! What a government! We gave you 3Â½ hours last night by agreement. You lose a vote on an amendment and you say: 'Oh, my goodness! We have to guillotine debate because we don't want any further debate.' What are you so scared of? This is a complete dummy spit by Senator Cormann, the man who styles himself as the Leader of the Government in the Senate. What a dummy spit! You lose on one amendment and now you want to guillotine the debate. I mean, really?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me just come back to this point. The government say, 'Our priority is low- and middle-income earners.' Do you know what? They're holding tax cuts for low- and middle-income Australians hostage to tax cuts for high-income earners that they want to deliver in six years time. That's what this guillotine is about. They're saying, 'Let's hold hostage the tax cuts for low- and middle-income Australians that will apply from July this yearâ€”next monthâ€”that everyone in this chamber supports, except the Greens, to tax cuts for high-income earners in six years time.' That is what this guillotine is all about. It's not about low- and middle-income earners. It's about executing a naked political tactic to prioritise high-income earners in six years time. It only needs to be said to demonstrate how ridiculous it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say this to the crossbench: regardless of your position on tax, what a discourtesy to the chamber. We gave this government 3Â½ hours of debate last night, because we do understand that it is important to get on with this debate. We have amendments from Senator Storer, we have amendments from the opposition and we have amendments from the other members of the crossbench which have not even been debated. Did Mathias send me a little text and say, 'Can we please have a bit more time. Give up the MPI'? No. Because, you know what, they want the timetable to get it down to the House and back up again. This week it's all entirely about the political tactics but don't worry about the Senate chamber and actually debating amendments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the crossbench: why don't you make them guillotined for tomorrow so we can actually finish the debate? How about that? You see, I can't move an amendment because he's moved the motion in a way that I won't be able to amend it. How about we guillotine tomorrow, so that we can actually have a debate? If you don't agree to finish debate here what is clear is that this government is able to walk right over this Senate chamber as a legislating chamber, because they want to execute a political tactic. This is nothing to do with anything other than holding tax cuts for low-income Australians hostage to tax cuts for high-income Australians in six years time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an utter discourtesy, Senator Cormann, to me and to the opposition, when we gave you what you asked forâ€”additional hours last nightâ€”to come in here and spring on us, during a question time debate, that you're going to move a guillotine to not allow any further debate beyond 6.30 pm, which will not even allow the crossbench to debate their changes. Senator Cormann, if you and your team think that you will get cooperation from the opposition around a range of issues you want I think you better think something else, because we're not going to allow a discourtesy to the chamber like this to subsist. At no stage were we even asked to give up the MPI todayâ€”not even thatâ€”after we'd agreed to give up 3Â½ hours last night. Why? Because you want a political tacticâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, I have had a very good vantage point over a number of years from which to see that Labor hypocrisy. What I am referring to is my misfortune for the best part of eight years to be the manager of coalition business for half that time in government and half that time in opposition. In that time in opposition we saw an incredible display of the use of the guillotine. Over the course of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government 188 bills were guillotined. Debates on 188 bills were guillotined by the Australian Labor Party with the support of the Australian Greens but there was oneâ€”I have to sayâ€”outstanding example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not in the habit of doing this, but let me refer to a press release of my own from 20 June 2013 headed 'Government to gag debate on 53 bills in the Senate'. Senator Macdonald, who it would be fair to say has a fair degree of institutional knowledge in this place, still recalls what an incredible time that was.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just give a little more detail for the benefit of crossbench colleagues who may not have been with us at that time:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of the 53 Bills listed to be guillotined, there are 49 bills that will each be debated for less than one hour and of these Bills there are 30 that will be examined for less than half an hour, and 17 for less than fifteen minutes.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, for those opposite, using the guillotine was standard operating procedure. On this side of the chamber, it is something that is deployed very sparingly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Leader of the Government in the Senate indicated, everyone in this chamber knows what they are going to do. Everyone in this chamber knows what their position is. These are matters which have been canvassed extensively in both chambers of the parliament and in the community. The time has arrived for the Senate to do its job, and that is to make a call on this important legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth reminding colleagues that this legislation is all about allowing the Australian people to keep more of what is theirs. We've seen from those opposite an interesting twist on their previous policy of roll-back. You might recall that, when we introduced the new tax system and we got rid of the wholesale sales tax and applied the GST and reduced income tax all at the same time, those opposite wanted to roll back the GST. They actually wanted to remove a tax. What those opposite now want to do is introduce a different twist on the concept of roll-back, and that is to roll back tax cuts. They want to roll back tax cuts. This is bizarre in the extreme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleaguesâ€”I say through you, Mr Presidentâ€”should support this motion to suspend standing orders so that we can move the motion that will set out a mechanism and a time frame within which we can address this legislation together. That's what the Australian people expect. They expect us to get on with transacting the people's business. That's what this motion for suspending standing orders seeks to do: simply to give this chamber the opportunity to pursue the people's business. So we will not hear and recognise the calls of those opposite when they complain about the guillotine. I look at Senator Collins. She was the Manager of Government Business at the time that those 54 bills were guillotined.</span>

What a great day! We've been engaging in this debate: 'My tax cuts are bigger than your tax cuts.' 'No, my tax cuts are bigger than your tax cuts.' Where are we now? 'You guillotine more than we guillotine.' What a great day for the Australian parliament!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get to the crux of what's going on here. The government are desperate to rush this bill through because it's very clear that, the more that people understand about this legislation, the less likely they are to vote for it. We had a perfect example right here only a few hours ago. We had Pauline Hanson's One Nation party coming into the Senate, with Senator Hanson herself saying, 'I don't get a tax cut out of this; this doesn't affect me,' demonstrating that she has no idea what this legislation does. Stages 1 and 2 deliver Senator Hanson over $4,000 in tax cuts. That's what they do. When you add stage 3 of this bill, she gets over an extra $11,000 in her pocket. It is very obvious that even those members of the crossbench that the government are talking to don't understand it, and the government's desperate to rush it through this chamber. That's what's going on right now. The quicker you get it through, the less likely it is that Senator Hanson will understand what she's voting for.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rarely quote Paul Keating, but I will today. I'll quote Paul Keating in reference to another debate on tax reform. When it came to the GST and Mr Hewson, the then opposition leader, talking about his plans to introduce a GST, said, 'If you don't understand it, don't vote for it, because, if you did understand it, you'd never vote for it.' That's what Paul Keating said about the GST. That's the same advice I give to Senator Hanson. She clearly doesn't understand it, so don't vote for it. Don't vote for something you don't understand. She came in here and she impugned Senator Hanson-Young. She said, 'Senator Hanson-Young implied I'm going to get a tax cut, but I don't get a tax cut out of this.' She clearly doesn't understand the legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you vote for stages 1, 2 and 3 and you're on an income of over $200,000, that's an extra seven grand in your back pocket thanks to stage 3 of the tax cut. If you are a banker, a CEO, an executive or a politician, this package is a windfall. This is like winning the lottery. If you're a childcare worker, a nurse or a teacher, there's a few hundred bucks in your back pocketâ€”that's true. But if you're somebody who's working in this joint, or the CEO of a bank or a senior executive at a large corporation: thank you; that's thousands of dollars in your back pocket. This is a prescription to turbocharge inequality in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you hear a debate in this chamber and when you hear the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and members of the crossbench saying, 'No, my tax cut is bigger, better and fairer than yours,' what you're also hearing is: 'We're going to spend less money on schools. We're going to spend less money on hospitals. We're not going to increase Newstart. We're going to cut jobs from the Department of the Environment and Energy, so we're going to lose threatened species in this country. We're not going to invest in renewable energy infrastructure.' That's what you hear. When you hear, 'My tax cuts are bigger than your tax cuts,' just listen to what that means. It means that if you're waiting in an emergency department, you'll wait longer. If you're somebody who needs to have their hip replaced and you're on a waiting list in a public hospital, you'll wait longer. If you're somebody who sends their child to a public school, you'll pay more. If you're somebody who at the moment can't afford to put a roof over your head, if you're somebody on Newstart, you're going to be consigned to living in poverty. That's what this debate is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a debate that is ripping money away from the vital institutions that make Australia a decent country, and it's throwing around a few pre-election bribes in the lead-up to an election, saying to people, 'Vote for me, because I'm going to put some money in your back pocket, but screw your children, who are going to have to pay for the mess that we leave behind.' The reason this government wants to rush this piece of legislation through this chamber is that it knows that the people who are about to support it don't understand it. So Senator Hanson, I say to you, 'If you don't understand it, don't vote for it.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I'll follow Senator Wong's contribution as to why we oppose this suspension by firstly addressing Senator Fifield's reminiscing of days gone past. Some of that reminiscing, for instanceâ€”and I point this out to senators in the crossbenchâ€”is referring to standing order 142. The critical issue here is: what is the urgency? As far as we're aware, the only justification for this rush is that Senator Cormann is having a dummy spit because, an hour after he lost the vote, he realised he'd lost the vote. This is what the problem is. Senator Cormann is completely embarrassed about the fact that, as the Senate was addressing the running sheet, we started on the most significant issue. The most significant issue was stage 3. Senators in this chamber have addressed that matter and Senator Cormann and the government don't like it. To the crossbench: why should the Senate now cooperate with the government's dummy spit about the decision or the matter we have determined? Why would you do that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I made the point about the urgency. There is no urgency in this matter. There is no urgency about how stages 1 and 2 could operate. Indeed, proper and detailed consideration of the amendments before the Senate are critical to ensuring that what eventually is resolved in relation to stages 1 and 2 occur appropriately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about what the government have suggested here. They gave no notice. In the course of question time, they circulated a motion which I suspect was not even consulted on with the crossbench either. They left no opportunity to discuss alternatives to moving immediately into consideration of this bill and wiping out our existing program for the day. Senators, I ask you to remember the last time I made this point, which was the last time the government tried a stunt like this. It was only in the last sitting fortnight, if I recall correctly. The government say on one hand, 'We want cooperation; we want the Senate to work cooperatively in relation to how we work through that program.' Well, that's what we did yesterday. We said: 'We cannot imagine how you can get your legislative agenda through in the two weeks that are involved here. What do senators prefer in terms of when we should sit and how we should conduct our business?' We agreed to an additional 3Â½ hours last night to do that. But did the government give anyone any notice that this stunt was going to occur and that we were going to completely wipe out the program today to move to the committee stage consideration of this bill? No, they didn't. In fact, they probably designed it over the last hour or so once they woke up to the fact that stage 3 had been determined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, don't reward a dummy spit like this and don't be fooled by the characterisation that this is how things previously occurred. Senator Xenophon would have been very distressed if a gag of this character had been agreed to. The part of this story, of course, that Senator Fifield doesn't tell is that he wasn't particularly good at being a manager and, indeed, Senator Macdonald was the one running the floor most of the time. The problem with that disharmony was that they wasted an enormous amount of time, which then necessitated us managing their time to force them to deal with the critical elements such as what amendments they might propose. Even then they still wasted that time when they were time managed, because the current government, when in opposition, were not Her Majesty's opposition. They were too busy bickering and not addressing the critical issues that they should have. We're seeing similar things now, when, without any notice and with an enormous breach of faith in question time, they've landed a stunt like this. There is no urgency with this legislation.</span>

The Labor Party can go to the next election, if they want, promising to roll on taxes. 'Roll on new taxes' is what Labor's policy is going to be, but that's no justification to stand in the way of this Australian Senate, this year, at this moment in time, giving Australians better, fairer taxes, a tax cut that would create a better opportunityâ€”</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator JACINTA COLLINS:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. I commend you on that decision. Senator Cormann is in a flurry because he doesn't want the Senate to fully understand the implications of the motion that he's seeking precedence to move. Let me give you one example amongst opposition senators that we have been dealing with in the last few minutes. The question was: how does this impact on today's program? What does it mean for the remainder of the program? The motion that's been circulated appears to mean that when we get back to government business on the Red, which is item 19â€”when we get through all the other business this afternoon and get to item 19â€”if we haven't reached 6.30 by then, we'll have whatever the remainder of the time is. That is what the government is proposing. I would highlight to senators who have circulated amendments that are on the running sheet here to consider: if they support precedence now to deal with this motion, how much time will we be allowing for consideration of their own amendments?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what might happen here if we allow the government to abuse Senate processes and have this process occur. What will happen is that we will move through business on a Wednesday as we ordinarily doâ€”if you're lucky, under normal arrangements, you might only have about half an hour more of government businessâ€”and this tax plan that the government is moving, phases 1, 2 and 3, may receive only an hour and a half of committee-stage consideration in the Senate. An hour and a half! What are you hiding? There is no rush. There is no urgency; I'll come to the detail about the lack of urgency in a moment. But I do ask senators to consider: do you really want to allow precedence for this minister to move a motion that will circumvent proper consideration of the government's tax plan? If you allow precedence, that is where we will be going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have before the committee-stage consideration amendments by Senator Storer, a class by the opposition, a separate class by the opposition, Senator Storer, Centre Alliance and the opposition again. Indeed, we've dealt with the final block but only one block of all of the amendments here. Of course, what's generated this dummy spit is that, in managing the committee-stage consideration, the opposition went immediately to the critical issue and the Senate determined an outcome that the government doesn't like. I ask those senators who joined with the opposition and the Greens to vote down stage 3 to consider common sense here: if you agree to precedence, and if you agree to this motion, you're basically compromising yourself. You're saying, 'I oppose stage 3 but I'm going to circumvent any consideration of the other stages and I'm going to fast-track this back to the House of Representatives.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then comes the next danger of interpretation in this motion. Have a very close look at paragraph (c) in the motion, and read the last phrase in (c): when the message comes back from the House of Representatives, it will be dealt with 'immediately without amendment or debate'. What this government is trying to do is the extraordinary thing of removing your own prerogative. Why would you support it? It makes no sense. This is an enormous dummy spit by Senator Cormann because he did not succeed with stage 3. Now he's asking senators to compromise their own capacity in relation to dealing with this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You saw just a moment ago that the government needed to even get advice about how to move forward with the guillotine, because they didn't know when senators could speak. Fortunately, I do know it is our prerogative to address this issue, and we should do so. We should allow time for all senators to understand what this motion really means. So, on the face of it, I and others thought, 'Oh, we're going immediately into this.' Well, we're not. We'll get to it at item 19 on the Red, if we even get there before 6.30. And guess what's going to happen at 6.30? At 6.30, we're going to roll through votes. You won't have the opportunity to ask any questions. You won't be able to query the government about how one thing or another with stages 1 or 2 might operate. They are completely avoiding scrutiny of this package. They are removing the Senate's power to review. Our critical and core responsibility is what is at stake here. That is what this motion does. I would be stunned if a well-informed senator would agree to have their powers compromised in this fashion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's get to some of the other facts of the matter here. Let's go back to Senator Birmingham's discussion about the urgency. There is no urgency other than the government's desire to spin together some political whim. Let's address these tax issues. Labor supports stage 1. So there's no urgency on that one. In fact, it's a refund. You've got until June-July 2019 for it to be dealt with administratively, so there is no immediate urgency on that. Step 2 doesn't come into effect until 1 July 2022â€”48 months away. Step 3 doesn't come into effect until 1 July 2024â€”72 months awayâ€”up to two terms of the parliament. The other element of this picture that hasn't really been well explained by the government is why they are relying on standing order 142. They're basically asking the Senate to again limit its power, limit its capacity, to consider issues in debate. I encourage senators who are considering this issue to have a look at section 142 in the standing orders. For crossbenchers, the standing orders are in your drawers. Have a look at it. Pull it out. Look at standing order 142. </span>

                  </a>  If I misheard Senator Abetz, I invite him to tell me what the real interjection was. If you make an interjection like that in debates, you will get a response. So, perhaps you would like to tell the crossbench what your real interjection was. I believe I heard what I said. If I'm not right, well, fair enough. But let's go back to the important issue here. This revision that the government is using is about getting senators to agree to a limitation of debate on bills. Don't agree to that sort of thing easily. You need to understand that there has been consultation, that there is some urgency and that there is a justification to essentially pass away your powers to ensure that matters are addressed properly. These are the issues that the government has not addressed. They criticise Labor when we are in governmentâ€”call us hypocritesâ€”but the fact is that in those stages we achieved agreement to manage the Senate program, because senators, including the crossbenchers, were frustrated with how this government conducted itself in opposition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the case here. The case here is that during question time the government alerted us, with no notice, that they were going to move this motion, and they are now suggesting that we should give it precedence. We should not give it precedence, because there is no urgency. Since there is no urgency, I now move the following amendment to the motion:</span>

That's our reflection on how Senator Cormann responded to the limited amount of consideration in detail being given to these matters ahead of question time. It seemed that at first the government didn't quite understand what had happened. Then, obviously, once they had realised what had happened they tried to convince some unsuspecting senators that they should relinquish their powers. I can't understand why any senator would do that, especially in a situation where we've had these bills before us for a limited time only. We facilitated the second reading debate last night and we've had only about an hour of committee-stage consideration, and there was no notice ahead of question time that the government was going to attempt to circumvent that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During question time, the manager was running around talking to crossbench senators, asking, 'How about this?' Don't agree to things under those circumstances. Get some advice. At least consider dealing with these issues about urgency or limitations on considerations after allowing yourself to be properly informed about what is really occurring here. On reading this motion, senators who have been in this place for quite some time at first believed we were going straight into the bill. That is not what I believe is proposed in this motion. It will occur when we get to item 19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've pointed out, the more concerning element in paragraph (c)â€”and it is critical we make this point at this stage, because the government might again attempt to rob us of any opportunity to amend the next motionâ€”is the issue of our dealing with a response from the House, without amendment or debate. This is outrageous. Had the government consulted us in relation to this motion, these are, of course, the points, after advice from the Clerk, that we would have been able to respond to. But we didn't have the opportunity to even seek advice from the Clerk. You saw a moment agoâ€”consider this, Senatorsâ€”that the Leader of the Government was in a flurry over understanding the motion that he was putting. He needed to seek advice from the clerks. On the floor we had to pause the consideration of the chamber for him to get advice from the clerk.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me again run through why there is no urgency here so that it's clear in the minds of senators. If the government agreed to have step 2 removed from this bill, leaving the parliament to vote only on step 1, we'd vote for that today. There's no problem. We would vote on that today. That's been Labor's position from the start. Stage 1 is the only area where there is such urgency. In relation to step 1 itself, the low- and middle-income tax offset, being a rebate, doesn't take effect until 1 July 2019, so that can be voted on anytime next financial year. The government can provide notice. The government can provide certainty. There's no real issue about certainty, and the government knows that. There is no urgency in relation to step 1. The change to the threshold can retrospectively be changed by the tax commissioner. There is no urgency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's consider the argument put by the government about certainty. I interjected when Senator Birmingham was talking about certainty, because he knows and I know that there is very little certainty in three of his core funding areas. Early childhood education: where's the certainty there? They can't even get sufficient families to register in the system. It's going to be an enormous mess next month when it becomes so clear that there are so many families missing out on their support for child care. School education: I have said time and time again that schools cannot plan their funding for next year. This is an enormous problem. This is a bigger issue of certainty than what is proposed with this tax issue. Higher education: the higher education bill is the third bill after this one. There is enormous uncertainty for higher education institutions about what circumstances will operate next year. They don't know how many future higher education places they can offer Australian students. These are the issues that lack certainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no credibility at all to suggest that certainty is the justification for this stunt. This stunt is an enormous dummy spit because the government lost stage 3. Step 3 of their tax plan has been rejected by this chamber in the committee consideration so far, and this is a dummy spit by the Leader of the Government in the Senate because this chamber acted. Don't remove your capacity to continue to act just because the Leader of the Government in the Senate is throwing a dummy spit or having a big sook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say again: Labor supports step 1. We would vote on that today if it would be facilitated, but of course it won't, because they're holding Australians to ransom for tax benefits for the top 20 per cent. Step 2 doesn't come into effect until 1 July 2022, 48 months away. Step 3 doesn't come into effect until 1 July 2024, 72 months away.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have agreed to a motion which prevents this chamber from debating a message from the House of Representatives. That is what paragraph (c) of this motion does: it prevents this chamber from debating a message from the House of Representatives. That is an extraordinary thing. I would invite the crossbench to consider what we were sent here to do as senators, which is to legislate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We accept, as we accepted during the debate, that Senator Hanson, for example, had a different view to the Labor Party on the tax package. We disagree with her view, but we accept that she has a right, obviously, to that view. We accept that Senator Patrick and Senator Griff had a different view on stage 2. They were with us in our opposition to step 1 but opposed us in relation to step 2, and we accepted that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are saying is that this chamber at least ought to have the opportunity not only to debate the bill in substantive but to debate the bill when it comes back after the House of Representatives takes out the amendments Senator Patrick supported. You ought to have the opportunity to have the chamber debate the bill that comes back from the House, given that the amendment that the House of Representatives will take out is the very amendment that Centre Alliance put into the bill. It is entirely illogical, franklyâ€”and I shouldn't just say Centre Alliance; it was Centre Alliance, the opposition, Senator Storer and the Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority in this chamber have voted to remove step 3 from the government's tax package on the very sound basis that they do not believe that this tax package ought to be held hostage to tax cuts for high-income earners put in place in six years time. That was a sensible amendment. So I'd invite members of the chamber to consider whether or not it is sensible to pass without amendment a motion which ensures that we cannot debate a message from the House of Representatives. That is our job. If the House does not accept amendments from the Senate, we ought to at least have the opportunity to debate whether or not those amendments should be insisted upon. That is what this second chamber does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm told that there's some deal whereby every party leader will speak when the message comes back. That kind of deal is not a substitute for the right of this chamber to insist on an amendment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put this point to Senator Patrick, Senator Griff and all of the others on the crossbench: the only amendment that has the prospect of being insisted upon is the amendment that you supported this morning. So why on earth would you allow a process whereby the government prevents you from debating and insisting on that amendment? It is an extraordinary thing to agree to that, to say, 'I'll vote for an amendment in the morning and then in the afternoon I'll vote for a procedural motion which prevents the chamber from insisting on that amendment.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion that Senator Cormann has just moved, which we cannot amend because of the procedure, is saying that the message be put immediately without amendment or debateâ€”in other words, this chamber works as simply a tick-off on whatever the House of Representatives has decided. That is not what senators were sent here to do. So I would urge the crossbench to support the suspension of standing orders to enable the statement to be made, and I would urge them to reconsider their position on paragraph (c).</span>

I want to make clear what this deal means. It means the Senate is seeking to bind its own hands so as not to insist on the removal of step 3. I ask those senators who supported amendments from the opposition and Senator Storer to remove step 3 of the tax package, for the reasons which were discussed this morning, to consider that they have just agreed to a motion to prevent this Senate from insisting that the amendments stand. What they have copped instead is a deal which simply says each of us can have a chat about it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We weren't sent here to have a chat and a cup of tea, actually. We were sent here to legislate. This amendment that those opposite are now saying we cannot insist upon is to remove step 3, which is the part of the package that does not start until 2024, that overwhelmingly advantages high-income earners, that is growing at 12 per cent a year in terms of the cost of the package and that will fundamentally undermine Australia's progressive taxation system. That is the amendment that the majority of the Senateâ€”the government and some of the crossbenchâ€”is today saying this Senate cannot insist upon. I would ask the crossbench to reflect upon the wisdom of going down this path. Whatever one's view about the content, to prevent the Senate from insisting is a very poor precedent, indeed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, I draw the Senate's attention to this extraordinary proposition where at quarter to five we get to discuss this matter. In 15 minutes, we'll have a first speech. We have yet to deal with some housekeeping matters. Then we will go back to the very, very brief, perfunctory discussion of the expenditure of $140 billion worth of expenditure on tax cuts! I want to say that in the context where some people have agreed, to ease their consciences for what they have done, that senators here, leaders of various parties, might get the chance to express their disappointment at what they have done and, as a consequence of that, rob themselves of the right to defend the people of this country from what is a shocking political abuse of the budgetary arrangements in this country whereby the very, very wealthy in this country, the most wealthy people in this country, get the benefit of a Liberal government seeking to distort the taxation system and undermine the progressive nature of our taxation system in this country to offer up a political bribe in the run-up to an imminent federal election. What is more, it is on the basis of a promise that might be kept two elections hence. That's the proposition that they have signed up to.</span>

That is what they claim. Senator Xenophon used to say that all the time. He would not have agreed to a guillotine of this nature. He would certainly not have agreed to a guillotine of this nature while claiming to be the centre force without talking to both sides in this chamber. But what has happened is that an ambush has been inflicted upon this chamber, an ambush on the Labor Party and the Greens. Of course, Senator Storer has been excluded, locked out from even putting a point of view about the importance of protecting the revenue of this Commonwealth, $140 billion worth of revenue, in circumstances where the very wealthy in this country are getting a decided advantage from a very conservative government seeking to undermine the fundamental principles of a social democratic arrangement in regard to the provision of the funding of essential services in this country, such as education and healthâ€”the services that Centre Alliance say they're very interested in. Can you imagine if we talked about the shipbuilding industry and pulled a stunt like this, an ambush like this, without ever talking to the opposition? Can you imagine the consequences for the people of this country?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is $140 billion worth of expenditure, over what are now going to be several election cycles, in which we'll see some people get a minimal tax arrangement whereby the very wealthy get a $7,000 tax benefit, which the government think is going to provide them with an electoral advantage, because of the circumstances of two elections hence. Frankly, I don't believe the people of this country are going to buy that argument. They're not going to buy it, because they know that this government is out of touch. They understand just how incredibly arrogant this government is. This is the merchant banker's view of politics. This is the view of Australian society from the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. This is not the view that protects the health services of this country, protects the schools of this country, protects the universities of this country, ensures that our pensioners have the necessary wherewithal to enjoy a decent standard of living. This is the sort of government that rends the social fabric of this country asunder. This is the sort of government we're seeing, which is actually driving deep hostility into the Australian people by making it clear to the Australian people that the politics and economics of this country do not work for ordinary people. They work for the very wealthy. They work for those with power and privilege. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I just have to take a second to compose myself from my laughter at hearing that last speech. Senator Carr is lecturing the chamber and lecturing the crossbenchers about the time management of this very important piece of legislation. He and the Greens political party continue to express outrage at how they could be restricted in the debate they have on this bill. I've been in this chamber for a while and, regrettably, I sat through the Labor years, the six dark years of Labor in charge. Do you know, Madam Deputy President, in the Labor years we had 188 bills through this parliament guillotined with the support of the Greens political partyâ€”188 bills, most of them with not even one word spoken on them, not one word. We were required to vote in a sausage machine style on 188 bills the Labor Party put up in government, supported, I might say, by the Greens political party, who always are holier than thou.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had to compose myself. Everybody knows that Labor lieâ€”that's becoming an accepted norm in this chamber and, in fact, right across Australiaâ€”but we now know that the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and their mates in the Greens political party knows no bounds whatsoever. They lecture the crossbenchersâ€”they think they're still at the CFMEU unionâ€”and think that by shouting at them, bullying them and standing over them, as they do in a CFMEU meeting, they can bully the crossbenchers into submission and into agreeing with them. But they don't like it when we remind them of not one billâ€”important though this one bill is on taxationâ€”but 188. Half of them were fairly routine; I'll accept that. The other half were very important bills, and they were guillotined by the Labor Party without proper debate.</span>

The hypocrisy is absolutely breathtakingâ€”188 bills guillotined, most of them without one word being spoken. We could have had two hours of debate by now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we're here to take note of answers in question time. The answer we are to take note of is the answer from Minister Cash to the question from Senator Carr. Once again, what the government demonstrated in relation to the question about 8,000 Telstra workers losing their jobs was that it just doesn't care. The answer talked about causing the economy to 'prosper and grow', but under this out-of-touch government Australians are suffering. They're suffering from stagnant wages, rising insecurity in employment, soaring costs of living and cuts to penalty rates. The mechanism that the government's put into place time and time and time again is to ensure that wages are kept low and that workers lose conditions. Both Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison are more concerned with ensuring tax cuts for millionaires than they are about doing anything to help workers, especially those 8,000 workers at Telstra. The government has made its feeling towards Telstra workers known, and, can I say, it is pretty disappointing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities, Mr Paul Fletcher, was asked this morning about the 8,000 job losses, his response was, 'These things happen.' It's hard to imagine a more callous response to 8,000 job losses than a minister in the Turnbull government shrugging his shoulders and saying, 'Well, these things happen.' I'm pretty sure those 8,000 families don't consider that these things just happen. It's clear that the government's got no sympathy and no real understanding of what happens when thousands of families and the communities around those families need to deal with 8,000 job losses. I've seen what happens with job losses, and it's not happy, let me tell you. It's distressing. It causes great personal and economic toll. It's not pleasant to watch. It's certainly not pleasant to be part of. The government should be watching and helping, not just shrugging their shoulders. Perhaps, if Mr Fletcher and Mr Turnbull don't believe the government has any power to do any good when events like this happen, they shouldn't have the responsibility of being in government.</span>

That will be a massive blow, of course, to the Tasmanian community, including to regional Tasmania, which you guys, especially the new Nationals senator, should be a bit concerned about. It's absolutely clear you guys don't care about regional Tasmania. Your policies are focused on the Sydney millionaires, Mr Turnbull's friends and neighbours, and you know that.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  Australians don't trust politicians. It's a universal truth. In fact, Australians are losing faith across the four sectors of the economyâ€”government, media, corporate and non-government organisations. But for my new role as senator for Queensland it is concerningâ€”most concerningâ€”that people's trust in Australia's institution of government, which has delivered peace and stability in this country for more than 100 years, is among the lowest globally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Is this scepticism a mere reflection of our cultural resistance to authority? No, I don't think so. The decline over the past years reflects a deeper malaise. Former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies said in October 1954:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Democracy is the greatest system of government yet devised by man; but it has its weaknesses and its dangers. So far from lessening the responsibilities of the individual, it magnifies them. When one man was the ruler, it was no doubt a matter for thankfulness that he should be wise and honest and competent. But now that we are rulers, we must all seek to be as wise and honest and competent as honest effort can make us.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Menzies recognised the shared responsibility we have to engage with the Australian people honestly, to have the difficult conversations about policy and the future direction of this country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree that honest engagement is how we rebuild trust with the Australian people. Over the past 100 years, we have put more trust than ever in the state to manage those times of our lives which are challengesâ€”unemployment, sickness, disability and old age. These were all taken care of by the family in the past but are now firmly problems for the state. This becomes particularly sad when you read news reports of people passing away in their homes and no-one realising until the mailbox is overflowing. Our robust self-reliance, so evident in our history, is slowly dissipating and is being replaced by an attitude of dependency where government is not the place of last resort to get assistance but the starting point. The government can't be the answer to all problems, nor should it be. If it is the answer then you've got a problem with your question. The loss of individual self-reliance makes our society weaker.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government automatically steps in, the role of the family is changed. It's not simply about money, because, if it were, the only impact would be on the budget bottom line. Government intervention diminishes the role and expectations of family. This in turn removes shared bonds and experiences and starves families of moments that build love and trust. These moments teach us compassion, respect and gratitude.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The size of our social security budget is often cause for an impersonal and often half-hearted debate about its sustainability and who is going to pay for it. The use of services once intended to be one's last resort for moments of vulnerability in life, but which are now seen as standard entitlements, has ballooned well beyond the point of being sustainable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The bigger, more troubling consequence is the disconnect of individuals from their families and the broader social networks that once provided a real safety net in times of need. We as a society have now outsourced these responsibilities to the government. It's the result of excessive intervention and one of the most compelling arguments I can think of for smaller government. It's not possible to outsource love or the bonds of trust and respect that are built through helping one another through difficulty. Working together through these moments is what turns us from being mere relations into a family. Outsourcing them denies us the chance to experience and become the best of community, the best of family and the best of humanity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Caring for older family members is difficult, but nothing can replace the relationship and memories that are built by being there when they need it most. It's not always possible for this to occur; I acknowledge that. But, wherever it can, it should be our choice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time we help our child with their homework or be stern when it would be easier to give in, we don't just complete a task. We build a bond of trust and respect, preparing them to succeed in school and life. A large part of the problem with Australian schools' education performance isn't the lack of resources. Spending on school education has never been higher. But it is, at least in part, the lack of effort of some parents and what they put into their children's readiness for school. When I hear a teacher lament that children in their class are starting school without toilet training, I think of this disconnect. Hardworking and dedicated teachers are saying they just can't get the parents of a struggling child to spend some time with them, helping to get their reading up to scratch. It's sad. Better resources for schools are no replacement for a parent's interest in their child's education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The content of education now covers matters that were onceâ€”and I think should continue to beâ€”matters for parents. Moral and social matters that connect to people's religious and political views are matters for family alone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the reason I put my name forward to serve in this parliament is I believe the work of this parliament should align with the interests of families, especially children. My mum and dad, whom I acknowledge in the gallery, did everything they could to give my sister and I every opportunity in life, even when it was hard for them to do so. But the times they were strict made us better. The times they pushed us to be our best were worth it. The times we were silly built our sense of fun. Now as a wife and mother to three beautiful girls I, and my husband, try to do the same. Every family will manage the strains of raising and educating children, while working to provide an income, differently. That is as it should be. So, while child care should be available and affordable for those who need it, so too should we value those families who choose to make the sacrifices needed for a parent to stay at home. One way of valuing that sacrifice would be to tax families as a unit rather than as individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is one principle that best serves the differing needs of all Australians, it is liberty. There is a core of liberty in every individual with which no-one can or should interfereâ€”liberty of conscience, of thought and feeling. Of almost equal importance is the right to express it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Government is ill-equipped to promote human happiness; this can come only from within the individual. It is why small government delivers the most benefit to the most people. It is the one factor that is the most essential to the development of humanity in its richest diversity. I'm not speaking about diversity in the sense of finding some immutable characteristic like your sex or skin colour to justify being treated with a privilege over others, or to claim some kind of special victimhood. Rather, it is a deep appreciation of the different skills and talents we all bring to life, and the ways in which freedom allows us to develop and harness those gifts.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a proud conservative, but we conservatives are misunderstood. Many think we are preoccupied with money and economics, while the left is about people and kindness. As Goldwater put it, 'Conservatism is not an economic theory, though it has economic implications. The shoe is precisely on the other foot: it is socialism that subordinates all other considerations to man's material wellbeing,' sifting them into economic classes and demanding that they progress. Conservatives take account of the whole person, seeing him or her as both an economic creature and, more importantly, a spiritual creature whose individuality, creativity and very essence matter. Many talk about the needs of the common man and woman, but the conservative knows that we are not an undifferentiated mass. The very best of our history and development came from the initiative and ambitions of uncommon men and women. Our human differences are our strength.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, what defines us as a nation is equality of opportunityâ€”the right to aspire to be the best versions of ourselves. That's different to equality of outcome, which can never be more than an empty promise: impossible to deliver, and unsatisfying even if we could do it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">An important facet of freedom of thought is freedom of religion. It is deeply troubling to have so many examples to point to that suggest this freedom is under attack in our culture. If we fail to defend people's right to believe and to practice their faith, we deny our nation its moral bedrock. Tolerance must cut both ways. In the twisted name of tolerance, freedom of speech is also under fire. Before I was even sworn in, I was tagged by members of the opposing party as having engaged in hate speech. Those who know me well might find that funny. My crime was to have said that the measure of a society is how it treats those who cannot speak for themselves: the aged, the ill, people with a disability, children and the unborn. This is a prime illustration of just how wrong-headed the issue of speech has become in this country. Make no mistake: the right to freedom of speechâ€”whether those ideas are wrong or rightâ€”is fundamental to a free society and a functioning democracy. Cut it off, and we starve ourselves of the refinement of ideas needed for us to flourish.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be a part of a government that has made it a priority to reduce the income and corporate tax burden, because I firmly believe that lower taxes will deliver a better standard of living to all Australians, particularly by creating work opportunities for those who are currently struggling with unemployment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Youth unemployment in outback Queensland sits at 54.2 per cent, but there are some in this parliament who would block job creation. It's not rocket science: reduced corporate taxes lead to higher investment, investment leads to more job creation, and the tightening of the employment market drives wages up. Similarly, reduced income tax means more money in the pockets of Australians and, when spent, stimulating demand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more we can do to increase productivity. Industrial relations reform is something our nation desperately needs and which the conservative side of politics should promote. If we want employers to give a person on the margins of the employment market a goâ€”even when to do so might be a leap of faithâ€”we need to support them to do so by removing the disincentive of punitive unfair dismissal laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be prepared to take the difficult case for increased productivity to the community, which offsets the appeal of raising minimum wages and penalty rates, because they both reduce job opportunities for those most in need. I understand that telling lower paid workers they will take home more money today is popular; it's easy. But we need to be honest enough to say frankly that each time we do, we deny a job to another person desperately in need of one.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The unions rail against casualisation or layoffs, but it is the direct product of the policies for which they advocate. We must also be honest enough to say that it is productivity gains that will sustainably deliver real wage growth for those who need it most. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to introduce competition to workplace representation. Teachers, nurses and trades usually join unions to access insurance and representative services, not to gain a political affiliation. They don't trust union representation in a bargaining process, where the unions arrange kickbacks for themselves and forget or sell out the needs of the workers. A simple way to reduce these abuses of member interests is to end union monopolies. Many workers value workplace representation, but they don't want politicised workplace representation. Let the market give them the choice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the height of hypocrisy that the Left in this country rails against big business but supports the continued tax-free status of unions, which have become multimillion-dollar businesses with sophisticated commercial operations. It is pure irony that those selling the socialist dream have taken so well to capitalism. When a union is selling insurance, investing, selling education services and running all manner of start-ups, they should be taxed like the business they are. We owe the Australian taxpayer no less.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">And we must never give up on the principle that government should provide the lightest possible burden on the entrepreneurial spirit of Australians. We should test every piece of legislation, every regulation against the standards of necessity and efficacy until red tape and green tape no longer hold back the projects needed for Queensland and Australia to grow and prosper.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is a special place for me because I am a federalist. I have had the privilege of serving and learning from one of this country's finest federalists, Ian Callinan. It was quite an apprenticeship. I believe it is the responsibility of the people who sit in this chamber to represent their home states with vigour while resisting the centralising tendency of the Commonwealth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a Constitution that is beautiful in its simplicity. It doesn't seek to make grandiose gestures and it doesn't seek to make people feel good; instead, it carefully sets up the machinery of federal government. Importantly, it treats all Australians as one. Yet it doesn't operate at present in the way that our founding fathers intended. The challenge for the future is to recalibrate it for accountability. A good startâ€”and one for which I'm prepared to workâ€”would be to make the states responsible for raising the funds that they spend, ending once and for all their opportunity to simply blame the Commonwealth for their every woe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 11 other senators here who will agree with me about my chosen home state. Queensland is a magnificent placeâ€”from the cape to Coolangatta and Cameron Corner. It has beautiful landscapes: the beach, the rainforest, the bush and the desert. We are rich in minerals, leaders in agriculture and an exporter of education. It has some of our nation's worst roads, and, like my colleagues, I'll be fighting for them relentlessly. I promise you that the Bruce Highway north of Bundaberg is never far from my mind. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I love most about my home town of Brisbane is that you can walk the streets and chat with strangers like you were in any tiny country town. Its warmth makes it a wonderful place to call home and a wonderful place to raise a family. I look forward to working to provide as much opportunity as I can to Queensland's families in the years to come.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been warmly and generously greeted by my colleagues, and I thank all of you who have attended today. I acknowledge my predecessor, the now High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, former Senator Brandis. While he and I have some philosophical differences, we both came from practice as a barrister and we both have a deep respect for the rule of law. As Attorney-General he served this nation well, and I wish him the very best for his next chapter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">One does not get to be the 99th woman to work in this place without the assistance of many. I can't name them all, but I'll start with my family. Both the Fell side and the Stoker clan do so much for Adam and I. Friends Barry, Ron, David, Kate, Chris, Vicki and Bernard deserve a special mention. Richard, I value your counsel very much. Wendy, you have been my mentor for years, and yet you are so humble you probably wouldn't know it. Matt and Julia, you two are very special friends. You've put an end to the old saying: 'If you want a friend in politics, you should get a dog.' I don't know where we'd be without you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the hard bit. I say to my three lovely girlsâ€”Mary, Jane and Emmaâ€”you won't understand today until many years down the track. Know that I endeavour to show you by example that no path is closed to you and that you can and should pursue your wildest dreams knowing that they are all possible.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Adam is my wonderful husband. I'll always be grateful that on that January morning I showed up to campaign with a bunch of Young Liberals, out of embarrassmentâ€”I was looking absolutely dreadful; it was the day after a weddingâ€”I paired up to doorknock with the one person in the room I didn't know. It has turned out to be the best decision of my life.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been a private barrister and a public prosecutor, but I got my start sorting fittings in my family's plumbing business. It's the story shared by so many families who aspire, generation by generation, to improve their lot. I'm proud of that. It reflects so many Australians that I hope to represent well and so many of the Queensland LNP members who have entrusted me with the gift of their endorsement. I'm a product of the grassroots of that membership, and I always will be. I thank every member for that honour.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For as long as I have the privilege of serving God, my Queen, the values of the Liberal National Party and, most importantly, the people of Queensland, I will do so to the best of my ability, listening sincerely and aiming always to stand with fortitude even in our most difficult debates so that I might contribute to restoring the trust of Australians in our political institutions.

              <span class="HPS-Small">With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  After a speech like that, it's fantastic to come and talk about smaller government and lower, fairer and simpler taxes. The things we just heard from Senator Stoker are about the importance of individual responsibility and the importance of creating equal opportunity as opposed to equal outcomes, and one of the key things is reward for effort. If people take the risk of starting a small business, or if people take the opportunity before them to get educated and to move into employment, they deserve the reward that comes from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The criticisms from those opposite about this tax package go to the fact that they say it's not progressive, but can I repeat the figures that Senator Cormann, the finance minister, mentioned during his answersâ€”and we are here, at the end of the day, to take note of answers. Under this package, for somebody earning $30,000, a tax cut is worth 8.3 per cent, whereas for someone on $200,000 it's 0.2 per cent. The top 20 per cent of taxpayers currently are paying 60 per cent of the income tax that is received by government. When this package is implemented in full, the top 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers will still be paying 60 per cent of the income tax that's received by the government. So, what we're doing, by implementing these three phases and by trying to address things like bracket creep, is to still keep Australia as a place that has a tax system that is fair but to make it simpler and to lower the level of tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the fallacies in this argument is that people love to talk about the tax rate that people are paying. But, by the time you look at what they pay for each level, what's excluded and then the various levels coming up, for the two examples that Senator Cormann used before, if you take the tax that is paid as a function of the income earnedâ€”as opposed to having all the steps but just as a function of income earnedâ€”for the $30,000 income, tax of $2,200 is around 7.3 per cent. For the person on $200,000, who's paying $67,000 of tax, that's 33.5 per cent of income. So, if you look at it in the overall picture and put the right context around it, you quickly understand why the top 20 per cent of taxpayers are paying 60-odd per cent of the income tax that Australia then relies on for things like schools, hospitals, education and funding our Defence Force. The fallacy that is put forward by those opposite is to take a percentage figure without applying the full context. When you look at those figuresâ€”the fact that somebody who is earning $200,000 is paying $67,000 of tax and that equates to 33.5 per cent in overall terms of the income that they have earnedâ€”what that shows is that they are paying substantially more in both percentage and dollar figure terms than someone on a lower income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you then also take into account that the majority of low-income earners in Australia pay no net tax because of the churn and the things that are handed back, what you see is that this system that the government is looking to put in place is, in fact, a tax package for lower, fairer and simpler taxes. Why is that important? It's important because that's at the heart of a strong economy. That's at the heart of an economy that means that government will have the money that it needs to pay for the services that we are here to provide for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Stoker said, in an ideal world the government would do only what people are unable to do for themselves. But where we do need to provide services we need to be able to afford it, and under the policies of this government we have finally got back to the point where we are no longer borrowing to pay for those daily costs of government. Because of the debt run up by the Labor government under Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard, for years now Australia has been borrowing money to pay its daily living costs. It's only the good financial management of the coalition government, under Prime Minister Turnbull and Treasurer Morrison, that has returned us to the point where we are no longer borrowing money. This package is for lower, fairer and simpler taxes to benefit Australia's future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  Obviously, quite a few hours have now passed since question time, where we kicked off by asking questions about the very sad announcement by Telstra overnight that it would be cutting 8,000 jobs from its Australian workforce. This is yet another absolute tragedy of massive job losses that we're seeing in Australia under the stewardship of the Turnbull government. What's probably even more tragic is that, as the day has unfolded and various ministers have been asked about this in question time, in press conferences and elsewhere, consistently we've heard from Turnbull government ministers classic laissez faire, hands-off responses: 'This is a commercial decision,' or, 'It's a matter for Telstra,' or, most tragically of all, from Minister Paul Fletcher, 'Things happen.' As I say, it is another classic example of how this government approaches managing the economy and ensuring that Australians have good, secure, well-paid jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of us can forget the approach that the government took in the previous term in relation to the car industry, when not only were they quite happy to stand on the sidelines and watch the car industry in this country be closed down, at the cost of tens of thousands of jobs, but they actively cheered it on. They actively encouraged and dared some of the biggest car-makers in the world to shut down the industry, andâ€”what do you know?â€”they did. We kissed goodbye to tens of thousands of good, well-paid, secure jobs that in many cases had been held in certain families for generations. And it's happening again today with the loss of these 8,000 jobs in Telstra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't until this announcement was made that I found out that funding for the very thing these Telstra workers, and the car industry workers before them, need most from governmentâ€”labour market support to assist them to find new work, retrain and move into new occupationsâ€”was actually cut in this year's federal budget. In this year's budget, the federal government, the Turnbull government, has taken money out of its labour market support programs, which are used as structural adjustment packages to assist workers in industries experiencing large numbers of retrenchments, just like these today. Not only do we have a government that's prepared to just wash its hands of any responsibility and say, 'This is just a commercial decision; things happen; nothing we can do,' just like it did with the car industry; it's actually making it harder for these workers to find new jobs by taking money out of its own labour market support programs. It's another classic example of this government's approach to jobs and the lack of concern it has for working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Telstra are now under an immediate obligation to start consulting with their workforce and unions about managing this change for as many employees as possible. We've seen this in other industries, and I'm thinking particularly of banking. Some of the big banks announced massive job losses recently, and what has become clear to me, particularly through a Senate inquiry I'm involved in, is that some of the banks are not consulting their workforces or unions at all about what other opportunities there might be within these large organisations to move people into different roles. I wouldn't be at all surprised if, at the same time as cutting these 8,000 jobs, Telstra were actually looking at creating other jobs in other parts of its business. It may well be that some of these 8,000 people can simply be retrained and redeployed into existing roles rather than being thrown out on the scrap heap, which is what Telstra seems to be planning to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government spend a lot of time crowing about jobs growth, but they never want to own up and they never want to front up when big companies are doing the wrong thing by their workforce, like what we are seeing from Telstra today. The government never talk about the fact that there are well over a million people in Australia who are underemployed, who are not able to find the amount of work which they are looking for. They don't want to talk about the rising level of insecure work that is hurting so many Australians right around the country. They never want to acknowledge research from groups like the Centre for Future Work, which was able to show recently that, for the first time in Australian history, now we have less than half of Australians who are employed working in permanent, full-time positions with paid entitlements like sick leave and annual leave. The government constantly want to deny that we have a crisis of insecure work, when the facts show that more and more people are surviving on casual work and part-time work when they want more and are finding it difficult to feed their families. The government have to do more. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Payne) to a question without notice asked by Senator Patrick today relating to the Future Submarine project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Australian Navy Future Submarine project will be a critical part of Australia's defence capability through much of this century. It is a project of huge budget significance. On 20 May, Defence gave evidence at estimates that the Future Submarine design and build cost would be $50 billion in constant dollars and, additionally, sustainment costs would also be of the order of $50 billion through to 2080. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute have calculated the estimates figures used by Defence and basically state that they equate to a design and build cost of $79 billion and a sustainment cost of $124 billion in out-turn dollars. These are very large numbers. In fact, they are bigger numbers than the three-stage tax cuts that are being talked about today. Yet we have the whole parliament focused on that, and almost nothing is happening in relation to this project in terms of transparency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This huge defence project has been determined through very opaque decision-making and with barely a fraction of the scrutiny it deserves. The competitive evaluation process was conducted under a high degree of security, leading to the government's April 2016 decision to select France's Naval Group as the designer of Australia's 12 submarines. What I reveal today is that the bid of the German submarine builder TKMS, which was rejected by government, was very much lower than the $50 billion accepted by government. TKMS's offer was not $50 billion but $20 billion for 12 submarines built here in Australia. On 29 February 2016, TKMS wrote to the defence minister reaffirming their offer, and I quote, 'for a fixed maximum cost of no more than $20 billion for the project'. They had first made that $20 billion offer to Prime Minister Abbott in 2014 and reaffirmed it at the end of the competitive evaluation process when they were fully aware of the requirements for Australia's Future Submarine capabilities. The German government offered to allow an open-book audit of TKMS's price. I don't know whether the government took up that offer. Of course, the government chose to go another way. They may have been well advised to do so, but the reason for the government's Future Submarine decision remains secret. There has been media reporting that Defence officials considered the German submarines to be unsuitable for a range of technical reasons. It has also been speculated that Defence favoured the Naval Group submarine because there remains a long-term interest in the possible acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines sometime in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is now clear, however, is that the government selected one option, Naval Group, that was $30 billion more expensive than anotherâ€”that of TKMS. I'm sure that other senators in this place could offer suggestions about what to do with $30 billion. It could have been committed to other defence capabilities. You could almost double the Joint Strike Fighter fleetâ€”in fact, you can double it for that $30 billion difference. It could well be spent on civil infrastructure, health, education services, investment in science and technology or other political focusesâ€”tax cuts, for example. Whether rightly or wrongly, the government secretly accepted a very large opportunity cost. An extra $30 billion cost requires rigorous scrutiny and a great deal more transparency than has been forthcoming from the government or the defence department so far. Unless the Senate takes scrutiny of defence expenditure much more seriously, especially regarding these very large projectsâ€”for example, the Future Submarine and Future Frigates projectsâ€”then we will have failed in our duty and taxpayers will have been sold short.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">On the 15th and 16th of December 2014 Mr Tori Johnson displayed conspicuous courage during an armed siege at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At approximately 8am on 15 December 2014, an armed gunman entered the Lindt Cafe and took 18 people hostage. The gunman directed Mr Johnson, the manager of the Lindt Cafe, to call 000 and say that all those in the cafe had been taken hostage by a man who was armed with a shotgun and explosives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The gunman instructed for the cafe's doors to be locked, as the ten patrons and eight staff became aware of their predicament. In response to the 000 call, police immediately cleared and secured the area around the cafe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Over the ensuing 16 and a half hours Mr Johnson instigated and maintained a rapport with the offender, pacifying him on many occasions without thought for his own safety. He relayed information to police and negotiators in a calm and rational manner which helped reassure the other hostages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Johnson, whilst knowing the layout and exits of the cafe, chose not to take the opportunity to escape. He specifically remained with an elderly, less mobile, hostage even when she requested he leave without her when an opportunity to escape arose. As the situation inside the cafe deteriorated Mr Johnson was directly threatened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Without regard for his own safety he continued to calmly obey the gunman's demands in an attempt to protect the other hostages.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At approximately 2 am Mr Johnson was placed in a kneeling position in front of the gunmanâ€”who fired and fatally wounded Mr Johnson. At this point tactical police raided the cafe which resulted in the death of the gunman.</span>

                  </a>  Labor will oppose this motion, because we see through Senator Bernardi's petty political games. Labor supports Australia's non-discriminatory migration program, which has been in place for decades. If people are facing persecution, regardless of where they are from or the colour of their skin, they are able to apply to Australia's humanitarian visa program and that application process will be assessed on its merits. Australia's protection obligations are clear and are set out in the Migration Act. Regrettably, the Minister for Home Affairs clearly feels differently. On 14 March 2018, the minister was asked specifically about South African farmers. He responded:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister clearly was calling for special attentionâ€”a different set of standards that would undermine Australia's non-discriminatory migration program. At Senate estimates, the minister's claims of special attention were defied by this own department, which said they were applying no additional requirements.</span>

                  </a>  The mistruths from those opposite, including Senator Bernardi, continue. Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities but have become places of indefinite detention because of the failure of the Turnbull government to negotiate other third party resettlement options. Labor strongly supports the US refugee resettlement agreement and has called on the Turnbull government to work with the US to expedite the resettlement process. Labor has also called on the Turnbull government to accept New Zealand's offer to resettle refugees from Manus and Nauru, and to negotiate conditions similar to the US refugee arrangement.</span>

What the Greens failed to acknowledge is that this is Australia's largest offshore intake since the early 1980s. The number of special humanitarian places for people with immediate family links in Australia has risen 2,000 per cent from 503 places in 2012 under the Labor-Green government to 10,600 places in 2016-17 under the coalition. Humanitarian places now go to people assessed as the most vulnerable offshore with family in Australia, rather than to people smugglers. This motion is just another stunt by the Greens.</span>

                  </a>  The government is investing in the preventive health of Australians. In the budget we announced $77. 9 million for infant health. The government will ensure our children get the best possible start in life. This will lead to them becoming healthier adults with lower obesity levels and a reduced reliance on the health system in the long term. In addition, we have committed $39.5 million to extend the whooping cough vaccine to pregnant women and to provide $17.5 million for research into maternal health and the first 2,000 days of a child's life. These measures are complemented by investment of $56 million in public health and chronic disease grant programs and other preventive health measures, such as the Prime Minister's One Million Steps initiative with the Heart Foundation.</span>

                  </a>  We often hear the howls of outrage from inner-city elites when a tree is cleared or water is drawn from a river for agriculture. However, the unheard voices are those of the farmers, who on a daily basis not only fight the inhospitable environment but also battle the scourge of feral pests. In addition to their severe impact on agricultureâ€”damaging crops and stockfeed and using limited water suppliesâ€”feral pigs, for example, are also exterminating the turtle population in North Queensland by feeding on turtle eggs before they hatch. Many turtles eat jellyfish in huge numbers, and declining turtle populations have contributed to exponential increases in the population of lethal jellyfish, such as Irukandji. As a result, these are quietly moving down the Queensland coast. Let us not wait until the Irukandji reaches the Sunshine Coast or the Gold Coast and destroys the tourist industry before the government steps in and gets rid of the pigs.</span>

The Ministerial Drug and Alcohol Forum is currently developing a national foetal alcohol spectrum disorder strategic action plan through the guidance of the national drug strategy committee. The plan is intended to provide a cohesive evidence based approach to strengthen Australia's efforts in preventing and diagnosing the disorder and better supporting those living with and affected by the disorder. It is expected that the plan will be finalised by the end of the year. The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation is currently considering implementing mandatory pregnancy warning labels on alcoholic beverages. Targeted consultation concluded on 14 June, and analysis of submissions is currently underway. A final decision on mandating pregnancy warning labels is likely to occur during an out-of-session meeting of the forum later in the year.</span>

                  </a>  This motion argues that the Northern Territory is a drain on national productivity. Right now, WA gets 34 cents in every dollar for its GST share. In the NT, the GST share is $4.66. How does this work? In other words, every person in the NT receives $12,000, compared to just $882 for every person in WA. Tasmanians get $4,600 per head, South Australians $3,600 per head and Victorians $2,389 per head. These figures have been confirmed by the Parliamentary Library today. In 2016-17, Western Australia accounted for 35 per cent of the nation's exportsâ€”that's 35 per cent of our exports. The Northern Territory accounted for just 1.6 per cent. Western Australia is by far the country's leading state on a balance-of-payments basis. The government must now release the Productivity Commission report on the GST and implement its recommendations. More GST for WA right now.</span>

                  </a>  Labor opposes this motion. In the Northern Territory there are many remote communities that suffer from high levels of disadvantage. We have a historical deficit. When it comes to issues such as infrastructure, housing, education and health, these need to be addressed if we are to have equal access to economic and social opportunities. The fact is that it costs more to run a health clinic in Yuendumu than it does in Melbourne. More than 70 per cent of our roads are unsealed. The massive GST cut recently inflicted on the Territory is the equivalent of closing every school in the Northern Territory and it will affect the people of the Northern Territory for years to come. With a population of around 250,000, generating own-source revenue is a challenge for the Territory. We do everything we can to attract private investment. Developing the north needs a national effort and it is to the advantage of all Australians that we pursue this common agenda.</span>

The time allotted for consideration of this bill has expired and the questions will now be put. I will first put the outstanding questions that were before the committee prior to senators' statements. I will put the question on the amendments that were before the chair earlier today. I will then work through the questions on the other amendments circulated in respect of the bill. If any senator wishes to withdraw amendments they have circulated, they may do so by leave.

I've made a ruling in respect of there being no need to read the amendments out. I have allowed you to put your point. I've made my ruling. I'm now going to put the question, because that is what the Senate has directed me to doâ€”to put these motions without debate or discussion.

I appreciate that you're giving me some leeway to do so, so I will be brief. The first is that these include the amendments which proposed Labor's bigger, better and fairer tax plan, so I just draw that to the attention of the chamber given that Senator Cormann made some inaccurate statements earlier today.</span>

These are items that fill a gap in the tax law as a result of the Senate's earlier decision to omit step 3 of the government's plan from the bill. They implement the step 2 tax rates for 2024-25 and later income years rather than leaving no rates in place, and they make associated consequential amendments. So I would invite you to consider putting those items that I've identified in that contribution separately.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  I'd like to take a little time this evening on the adjournment to talk about an important issue, which is grandparent carers across the Australian community, specifically the progress that has been made since the Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the matter. The Senate will recall that in December 2013 it established an inquiry into grandparents who take primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren. The Senate inquiry received 176 submissions from all over Australia, with 36 submissions from Western Australia. The committee held seven public hearings across the country and heard from 116 witnesses. The committee tabled its final report in October the following year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January 2016 the government responded to the report, supporting an increased focus on encouraging greater awareness and use of existing services and supports available to grandparent carers. As part of its response, the government agreed firstly to a trial expansion of the existing Grandparent Advisers program and expanded outreach activities conducted by all eight grandparent advisers. Secondly, increased support for grandparent and kinship carers by providing national information, resources and support. Thirdly, a national survey to better understand the demographics of non-parent carers and their needs so as to inform government policy and practices. I'm delighted that this very important, but often very invisible, issue continues to get the attention of the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, following the evaluation of an expansion of the existing Grandparent Advisers program, the program was expanded, and increased outreach activities have been implemented across Australia. Last year there were 319 Grandparent Adviser outreach activities conducted across Australia. In WA a total of 55 activities were undertaken, including 28 external outreach activities and 27 internal outreach activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Groups involved in the expansion included the WA Department for child protection, Centrecare, Wanslea Grandcare program, Escare and MercyCare childcare centres. We have also seen an increase in support for grandparent and kinship careers and their peer support groups. The Raising Children Network was engaged to provide national information, resources and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five carer forums were held in March and April 2017 involving over 300 participants, including 200 grandparent carers and over 80 service providers. In WA the forum was held on 12 May 2017 and included 50 grandparent carers and 24 service providers. These forums achieved a number of outcomes, such as increased grandparent and kinship carer capacity to care for their grandchildren and an understanding of how to run effective peer support groups; improved awareness of support services and resources available for better access; increased awareness, understanding and recognition of the role and contribution of grandparent kinship carers in the community and strengthened service provider capacity to support grandparent and kinship carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To increase service provider capacity, and to assist peer support groups to function effectively, four service provider forums were held across Australia, including one in my home state of Western Australia. The development of national information and resources has also been completed. The new information, tools and resources include: new Parenting in Pictures resources that cater for audiences with low text literacy; a comprehensive list of major support services in each state and territory; a new landing page on raisingchildren.net.au for all translated content to assist carers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and the completion of two electronic how-to guides to support and assist carers. Finally, the national survey was conducted in late 2016 by the Australian Institute of Family Studies with support from state and territory governments. The final report was submitted to the federal government in 2017 and was recently published in May 2018 on the Australian Institute of Family Studies' website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the government's response, grandparent carers have gained a number of protections and positive financial changes following a number of reforms to social security and childcare legislation. I acknowledge Senator Claire Moore and Senator Carol Brown, who also participated on the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry some years ago. Specifically, grandparent carers have been exempted under the family tax benefit part B changes. The family tax benefit part B continues to be available, as per the current rate structure, to grandparent and great-grandparent carers. Grandparent carers have been given access to a new subsidy under the coalition's new Childcare Assistance Package, which begins on 2 July 2018. This grandparent-specific top-up subsidy is available in addition to the standard childcare subsidy and will provide income support for those grandparents who are the primary carers of their grandchildren. We've also exempted grandparent carers from the childcare subsidy activity test. This means grandparent carers will be eligible to access up to 100 hours of approved child care fortnightly. I'm sure everyone in the Senate would agree that grandparent carers deserve our continued support and advocacy. While this is progress, there is always much more that can and should be done for these unsung heroes who live in our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the upcoming Super Saturday elections. In particular, I'd like to talk about the by-election in Braddon. The upcoming by-election in Braddon is a fantastic opportunity for the people of Tasmania to send a message to the Liberal Party. It's an opportunity for the people to tell this government, and indeed the government of Tasmania, that they value the work of Justine Keay and that they value what she's done as their member to improve their region. It's an opportunity for people to say that they don't want someone who thinks that aged-care work is bad work, as the Prime Minister suggested only yesterday. They want someone who has worked in the community and has worked for the community for years. They don't want someone like Brett Whiteley, who cheers at the prospect of young people having to starve, and they certainly don't want a former bankerâ€”Brett Whiteleyâ€”who thinks it's okay for the sick and elderly to pay a $20 tax when they see a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the people of Braddon voted to replace Brett Whiteley with Justine Keay in 2016, they sent a signal to the Liberals. After three years of being represented by someone who ignored them, refused to listen, blocked anyone with a dissenting view, wanted to cut their penalty rates and stood against critical services for west and north-west Tasmania, such as schools and hospitals, the people of Braddon instead decided to vote for a local representative that stood for their best interests. People in Braddon don't need a former banker who's going to vote with this out-of-touch Prime Minister to give a taxpayer-funded handout to big banks. They've seen what Mr Whiteley and the Prime Minister have done for the community, and they've rejected it. They've seen how Mr Whiteley stood with this Prime Minister in the way of a banking royal commission, and they know where his real loyalties lie. He voted six times against a royal commission. The people in Braddon, like the rest of the nation, have seen and have been shocked by what has come out of the banking royal commission, and they can't believe that the Liberals stood in the way of this for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Braddon, like all Australians, are after a representative who will be a champion for the things that matter. They're after an advocate for their region who will see tax cuts brought to everyday Australians. That's why a Shorten Labor government will deliver tax relief to 39,000 people in Braddon, and that's why re-electing Justine Keay is an important part of seeing those tax cuts that matter delivered to the people of Braddon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Prime Minister's tax plan sees the largest share of the benefits go to his own electorate in Sydney, it places Braddon 147th in the country. That's just four from the bottom. That's why I'm proud to support Justine Keay and to work to see her returned as the member for Braddon. I'm proud of what she stands for, and I know that she'll fight for the people of the west and north-west coasts of Tasmania. After all, it's their wellbeing that matters to her, not the wellbeing of big banks and multinationals. That's why she'll fight for their best interests ahead of the few in Point Piper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justine is someone who has worked in public service and has served her city as a local alderman, as well as serving as a local representative for Braddon. Her opponent is someone who, like this Prime Minister, has worked as a banker; he's someone who, like this Prime Minister, stood in the way of a royal commission into the banks; and he's someone who, like this Prime Minister, thinks that people like those who have critical roles as aged-care workers in Burnie just need to get better jobs. This is the kind of person who cheered, 'Hear, hear!' when my colleague Mr Tim Watts characterised this government as wanting young people to earn, learn or starve. Can you get a less compassionate group of people than this current lot that we have in government now? That's why I'm proud to back Justine Keay. I'm proud that she's been an advocate for Braddon, and I know that, if returned, Justine will continue to be a strong advocate for the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:41</span>):  As many in this place know, I'm a passionate advocate for cancer patients and their families. We need to find better ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancers of all kinds. I want to speak tonight just quickly about EX-MED Cancer, a best-practice exercise program for people with cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can imagine, cancer has a serious impact on the health and wellbeing of cancer patients. The impacts include fatigue, cognitive impairment, accelerated bone loss, incontinence, dysfunction of other sorts and many others. For example, I personally have developed a bit of a hearing disability since my brain cancers. Years of scientific research has established that exercise is an invaluable medicine in the management of cancer, and evidence shows that exercise helps cancer patients counteract their cancer related fatigue and tolerate their treatments. Exercise minimises functional impairments, relieves stress and mental distress and is safe during and after treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Clinical Oncology Society of Australia, or COSA, is calling for exercise to be embedded as part of standard practice in cancer care. Currently approximately 60 to 90 per cent of patients do not meet the recommended exercise guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, and this is perfectly understandable. Cancer can be a tough, horrible disease. Exercise is not naturally something that people with cancer generally want to do, particularly if the disease is causing them pain, discomfort or fatigue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, as I said, I've met with Associate Professor Prue Cormie and Nicole Cooper from EX-MED Cancer. Associate Professor Cormie is an accredited exercise physiologist and researcher whose work focuses on the application of exercise as medicine for the management of cancer. EX-MED Cancer is a not-for-profit entity dedicated to ensuring cancer patients receive best-practice exercise medicine. It is a partnership between a number of organisations, including the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, the Australian Catholic University, the University of Melbourne, Ovarian Cancer Australia and others. EX-MED Cancer provides the following services: coordinating the referral pathway from medical professional to patient and on to qualified practitioner; managing the delivery of a structured personalised exercise program; collating data for ongoing research; engaging with the multidisciplinary medical teams involved in cancer care to improve engagement and the delivery of exercise prescriptions; and delivery of education to cancer care practitioners responsible for the delivery of exercise medicine. Their goal is the improved health and wellbeing of all Australians with cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, there are approximately 138,000 cancer diagnoses every year in Australia, and it's expected to reach 150,000 by 2020. So far EX-MED has had around 500 patient inquiries across a broad spectrum of cancers and over 200 inquiries from members of the medical profession. People with cancer can enrol themselves through EX-MED Cancer, or they can be referred by any member of the healthcare team or by community based organisations like the Cancer Council. After enrolling, EX-MED will provide information about the service and an information pack. Patients will be registered for the next EX-MED Cancer term at a site closest to their home. Patients can access information through the EX-MED Cancer Hub, a central point of contact and information, which patients and health professionals can access at any point throughout the program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a GP has assessed that the patient is well enough to exercise, the exercise physiologist will do some simple physical assessments in order to tailor the exercise prescription. After an instructional exercise session, in which the exercise physiologist will teach them the exercises involved, the patient will then attend three one-hour exercise sessions for three months in a group of 10 people with cancer. The exercise sessions will be supervised by their EX-MED Cancer exercise physiologist, who will instruct them to complete their personalised exercise prescription. Finally, the exercise physiologist will reassess the patient's health status and provide feedback on their progress following the completion of the EX-MED Cancer program. The exercise physiologist will re-evaluate their personalised exercise prescription in light of their progress and develop a plan for them to continue exercising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patients are responding positively to this program. While EX-MED is currently based in Melbourne, it aims to expand internationally in the future. I would like to finish my contribution tonight with one final thought from EX-MED. They said to me when they came to see me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If the effects of exercise could be encapsulated in a pill it would be prescribed to every person with cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Even if this pill had just a fraction of the positive health benefits exercise provides it would be viewed as a miracle drug in the fight against cancer.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  One of the joys of being a senatorâ€”and I'm currently the youngest to occupy that role in this placeâ€”has been meeting with hundreds of young people. I've had the opportunity to speak with them in my role and here in the parliament. I must say that often one of the best parts of my day is looking up into the galleries of this place and seeing the wonderful young faces looking down on us all. I reflect whether our actions here do them justice. I had the opportunity a couple of months ago, in the lead-up and aftermath of National Youth Week, to talk to young people from Kalgoorlie to Bunbury and Denmark about the issues that matter to them, about what they would like to see us here do, about their aspirations and hopes for the future and about the ways they would like them to be achieved. We spoke about myriad issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that at times I was given pause to reflect on the fact that some of the debates and conversations that we had seemed to be more intelligent, more positive and better thought through than some of the debates I find that we engage in in this place. We spoke specifically in every context about how they would like to make their voice heard, how they would like to shape the political environment. Again and again they brought up with me the issue of lowering the voting age to 16 to give them the opportunity to make their voice heard at the ballot box because they didn't feel they were being heard now. So in that spirit I'd like to read some quotations from some young people who spoke with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to lowering the voting age, one said that it would allow young Australian citizens to speak out; another said that members of parliament need to listen to the younger generations and that it would enable young people to have their voice heard by the politicians who determine our future; and, finally, another saidâ€”and this really stayed with meâ€”that it would teach children that they have voices too. This person felt that at the moment only adults can be heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two very passionate young people who I've had the honour to work with and campaign with in the past are Angela Lillyman and Harry Sulley. Angela said to me in a letter that she wrote and subsequently recorded:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If I got a voice in parliament, if I got a vote, I would vote for things like real action on climate change, because it's directly relating to my future, it is such a big issue, it's so prominent and it is not being effectively talked about or controlled by parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Harry said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I believe that lowering the voting age would introduce young people to political processes â€¦ I've been involved in the online political community and I can tell you there are thousands of young people like myself in Australia who are politically engaged but aren't given the chance to take part in the process. I work. I'm in a Union and I contribute to the economy and the community yet I don't have a say in how my country is run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have found over this time that 16- and 17-year-olds are passionate and want to have their say in our politics. They are overwhelmingly in favour of lowering the voting age, although those who weren't made arguments so eloquent and intricate that they made the case as to why they should be given the option if they wanted to be. I would like to sincerely thank the hundreds of young people who shared their passions, thoughts and insights into the future with me. Thank you to Angela and Harry for sharing their stories and adding their voices to the campaign. Thank you to the students of Georgiana Molloy high school in Busselton, the Bunbury Senior High School, Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School and Great Southern Grammar in Albany, to the numerous young people who attended our events throughout Youth Week and to the Goldfields Youth Support Services. I am proud to be your voice in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="273829" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANNING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:51</span>):  This is not my first speech. I rise today to highlight the utter failure that is the United Nations Human Rights Council. This worm-eaten body of foreign despots and failing states has lost all moral legitimacy. As a nation that has not committed human right abuses, we should no longer validate it with our membership. For too long Australia has accepted a Human Rights Council that is a case study in human rights violations. The US has called for reform, yet it has refused. While Australia lacks leadership willing to challenge the situation, America is blessed with decisive leadership. Donald Trump and Ambassador Nikki Haley should be congratulated on their courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 47-member council hosts some of the most savage and despotic nations in the world. Let me name a few members of this group: Afghanistan, Angola, China, Egypt, Pakistan, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Ukraine and Venezuela. Does Australia really want to be partners with some of the worst human rights offenders in the world? Are we comfortable standing shoulder to shoulder with such towering paragons of human rights as China, Saudi Arabia and South Africa?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">China continues to kill and oppress its own people as well as the Tibetans, whose country is still illegally occupied. The persecution of Christians is widespread. Churches are forced into hiding due to fear of arrest. The restriction on religious freedoms is completely opposed to Australian and Western values. China has continued to bully its neighbours, seizing and fortifying islands in international waters in the South China Sea and threatening neighbour-states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saudi Arabia, a Muslim country well known for its complete lack of respect for women, continues to stone women accused of adultery. It sits on a council with the aim of advancing human rights. Saudi Arabia funds the expansion of radical Islamism worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Africa voted to remove the right to private property from its constitution in February this year. South Africa should have been removed from the council. The right to private property and its secure ownership is a fundamental right, as is the right to life, in regard to which the South African government seems equally nonplussed. I have highlighted in the past the ongoing targeted racial attacks on white farmers by black racist gangs. These are the very nations the Human Rights Council should be targeting for reform; they should not be in the driving seat controlling the agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there's been criticism of the council in the past, it has taken real leadership from the United States to highlight the complete hypocrisy of the Human Rights Council. Australia needs to find the courage to join the United States in refusing to grant the UN Human Rights Council the illusion of moral legitimacy. A group that apparently believes it is acceptable to suppress Christianity, spread radical Islamic terrorism and butcher white farmers has zero authority on any moral issue and is an organisation that Australia should not have anything to do with. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  This is an adjournment debate. I want to make a couple of comments, first of all, to Senator Anning, to say that Australia was proudly just recently elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Whilst I couldn't necessarily agree with your description of the other participants, I can say that Australia is an acknowledged leader in human rights. We feel that we can make a contribution towards human rights around the world by getting involved in this UN committee. It was an election, and Australia was successful in getting elected. We will bring all of our leadership in the human rights area to the group which you are concerned about and which, in the past, I have been as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to say to Senator Steele-John, if he thinks young people don't have a voice, can I suggest that he says to the young people he says that he speaks with that they should join the Young Liberal Movement. There are a lot of young people who do have a very big voice in the politics and the government of the country, and that is the thousands of young people between 16 and 25 who have actually joined the Young Liberal Movement and, in that capacity, have a lot of say and a lot of influence. They tell older parliamentarians like me and Senator Payne what young people are thinking, and we are then able to respect and honour their views. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate Senator Bilyk on the work she does with cancer. It's lovely to hear, on the adjournment debate, the sort of work that Senator Bilyk herself is doing. I only have admiration for her in that capacity and congratulate her. It is much different, though, I might say, to her Tasmanian Senate colleague Senator Brown, who spent her time on this adjournment debate justifying a person who knew that she should not be in parliament, who knew that she should not be drawing a salary from Commonwealth taxpayers when she knew, better than anyone else, as did Mr Shorten, that she wasn't eligible to sit in the chamber. Senator Brown spent all of her time in this adjournment debate praising Justine Keay and, at the same time, denigrating Brett Whiteley, a man who did a fabulous job in the short time he was in the federal parliament and who is fighting for tax cuts for the people of northern Tasmania. He is fighting for jobs for the people of northern Tasmania. He is fighting to support a federal government and a state government that has now done so much for Tasmania. Brett Whiteley is one of those intelligent, caring, enthusiastic people, who will again make a great contribution to this parliament and to Australia when he is, hopefully, as appears likely, re-elected to the federal parliament at the time of the by-election. I wish him well. He will get there on his own efforts, without any influence from Senator Brown or me, I might say, because the people of that area know and trust him. More importantly, they know and trust the Prime Minister, who Mr Whiteley supports, and they know and trust the Tasmanian Premier, who Mr Whiteley also supports. So I wish him all the best in the Braddon by-election, and I look forward to again working with Mr Whiteley.</span>
