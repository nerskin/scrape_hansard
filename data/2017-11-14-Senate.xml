While a lot has been said—and probably a lot is still to be said—regarding some of the circumstances towards the end of Senator Parry's term as President, I want to echo the words of those on this side of the chamber and the other side of the chamber who speak of him as an incredibly distinguished, decent and good-humoured being—and I know you will share in this, Mr President. Aside from politics, all senators felt that he was an advocate for all of us. Mr President, I wish former Senator Parry the best in his future endeavours and I congratulate you on your elevation to this esteemed position.</span>

This legislation is to do with issues around housing affordability. As my colleagues said last night, Labor supports this legislation and does not oppose the passage of it. However, we are not under any illusion that these measures will do anything for housing affordability. I note that this is an issue many members of the Senate have been very passionate about—and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge my good friend Senator Jacqui Lambie, who has just walked into the chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Lambie, there has obviously been a fair bit of media speculation over the past few days. I want to echo my personal view, which I know is the view of many senators across the political divide, that your contribution is a tremendous one. You are an incredible human being. You may be someone who on different policy areas at different times some of us haven't always agreed with, but what you have achieved and what you've been able to contribute, and the life experience that you have brought into this chamber, have made the Senate a better place. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  by leave—I haven't been able to sleep for days, ever since my citizenship has had a question mark next to it. There is no question mark anymore. It's in place—in an answer in black and white, courtesy of an email sent by a bureaucrat sitting at his desk on a London afternoon.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who knows my father will be shocked to think of him as anything else than an Aussie. He loves his footy, and to this day he's still heavily involved in his local country football club at Turners Beach in Tasmania. My dad believed my grandfather renounced his British citizenship years ago, but following the resignation of my former colleague and fellow Tasmanian, Stephen Parry, I knew I had to double-check. I received confirmation this morning that my grandfather hadn't in fact renounced it. This makes my dad a Brit by descent and, therefore, it makes me one too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with great regret that I inform the chamber and my colleagues of my resignation. I have been found to be ineligible by way of dual citizenship. I love my father to death and hope not to blame him for this. He has done nothing for which to apologise, and he has been my strongest supporter, my loudest cheer squad and my closest adviser. It's not because of him that I'm leaving this place; it's because of him that I'm here in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've worked hard to be a voice for those who don't often get much of a voice in this chamber. Veterans fight hard for this country and they shouldn't have to fight their government when they get back. Politicians on both sides of the house talk about helping those on welfare, without ever actually having experienced what it's like to choose between spending your welfare payment on either school uniforms or school lunches. The same politicians who spend their days making speeches and writing books about how they support Western civilisation don't do a thing to support pensioners. Voters must look at their options in despair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of what I've achieved here: I'm proud that my vote secured more funding for Tasmanian schools; I'm proud to have secured a feasibility study into expanding hydro into Tasmania; and I'm proud to have won a fair pay deal for our Australian Defence Force. I'm proud to have been the single vote that torpedoed a savage package of welfare cuts. Unlike some in this place who say they are for the battler, I actually refused to deliver the budget into surplus by driving struggling families into further poverty. I'm also saddened that I didn't get to achieve so much of what I was working to achieve; I couldn't help everyone who needed my help. It's my greatest disappointment in my time here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know what will happen next, personally or politically, for me. The government may be tempted to use my absence as an opportunity. To do so would be a mistake, because, while I may not be here, the Jacqui Lambie Network should still be represented, just as those who voted for the Jacqui Lambie Network deserve to have their votes represented. That's why I want to let the position of the Jacqui Lambie Network regarding upcoming legislation be known. The Jacqui Lambie Network does not support the government's agenda to strip away the power of workers to stick up for themselves. For that reason, I'm indicating that for pairing purposes the Jacqui Lambie Network's position should be taken to be that of the Leader of the Opposition on legislation relating to industrial relations, amendments to the Fair Work Act and changes to superannuation law and related procedural matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For pairing purposes, the Jacqui Lambie Network's position should be taken to be that of the Leader of Derryn Hinch's Justice Party on legislation relating to the drug testing of welfare recipients and placing those who fail drug tests onto a form of income management other than the cashless welfare card specifically. The Jacqui Lambie Network believes that the Medicare levy and the NDIS play an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in our society. The Jacqui Lambie Network's pairing position on upcoming legislation and related procedural matters should be taken as that of the Leader of the Australian Greens. And the Jacqui Lambie Network's position on the Regional Investment Corporation should be taken as that of the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding changes to the Marriage Act, I have always maintained that the purpose of a plebiscite is to hear what the public wants. If we don't listen to the public, the whole exercise has been needlessly indecisive, painful, expensive and extremely cruel. As such, the pairing of the Jacqui Lambie Network should be taken to be that expressed by the simple majority of Tasmanians as represented in the postal survey. Regarding upcoming legislation to introduce a First Home Super Saver Scheme, the position of the Jacqui Lambie Network for pairing purposes should be taken as that of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Regarding the upcoming Veterans' Affairs omnibus bill and related amendments, the position of the Jacqui Lambie Network for pairing purposes should be taken as that of the Leader of the Nick Xenophon Team.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I close, I would also like to thank my staff, who, at many times, have been my bloody saving grace, I'll tell you. You've proven yourselves to be loyal. You are wonderful. You are hardworking. And I would never have got this far without you. If you need a reference, make sure you come and see me, because I'm going to give you the best one you've ever had!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's so much more I wanted to do here, and I hope to get another chance to keep going at it. But the truth is: that's not up to me. I don't know what happens next. There's a state election I'm focused on, and I'll be helping my team do what they need to do to take the fight to some of the parties that have taken Tasmanians for granted. Beyond that, there'll be more to say, but, for now, I just want to say thank you—thank you for giving me the opportunity to be in here. And I'll tell you: you guys aren't as bad as they all say, although I'll keep telling them that! One day I do hope to be here. Actually, one day, I don't really care which side it's on, I do hope to come back, and, when I am back, I hope my dad's here too, cheering me on, like he's always been—my partner in crime. There'll be no ding next time, but, until then, I'll leave it to you. But, once again, thank you so much, and it's been an absolute pleasure to represent my country again—just not, this time, in uniform. So thank you.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. Before I come to the formal terms of the motion, might I say a few words about Senator Lambie, who has not yet resigned from the Senate, obviously, but whose resignation is imminent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be obvious to you, Senator Lambie, from these spontaneous expressions of affection, and, may I say, love that have come from all sides of this chamber, the effect that you have had upon all of the colleagues who have served with you since you have been elected as a senator for Tasmania. The Senate brings together people from all parts of Australia, from all walks of life, from all political philosophies, from all backgrounds—and it is the richer for it. The Senate has been the richer for your membership of it in these past times, since the 2016 election. We have all benefitted from your company, your wisdom, your life experience and, in particular, your passion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Passion is a word that is used too freely, too loosely, in politics. But, Senator Lambie, you have prosecuted your beliefs and the causes that you care about with real passion and, as a result, you have been very effective. I, in particular, representing as I do the portfolios I represent in this chamber, will always be conscious of what you have done in the area of national security and, in particular, the area of veterans' affairs and the rights and interests of those who, like you, have served Australia in uniform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have become one of the best-known and one of the best-liked people in this country since you joined the Senate, and the Senate is a better place, a much richer place, for you having served among us. On behalf of government senators, and I'm sure all senators, and on my own personal behalf, I want to thank you for your service and wish you the very best for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In view of what Senator Lambie has announced to the chamber, it is of course appropriate and, indeed, necessary for the matter to be regularised for orders to be made by the Court of Disputed Returns in relation to the position that Senator Lambie is about to vacate. The motion I will move is in the same terms as the referral motions for other former members of this place who have fallen foul of section 44(i) of the Constitution. I move:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should indicate as well that it will be my intention to instruct the Solicitor-General in relation to this reference, given that a reference was made in relation to the Hon. Stephen Parry, also from Tasmania, only yesterday, that it would be convenient and efficient for both matters to be dealt with at the same time and to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible so that the representation of the state of Tasmania in this chamber can be restored to its full complement. I thank the Senate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I'd like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Brandis in relation to Senator Lambie. Senator Lambie has been an absolutely tough, resilient and, at most times, highly entertaining senator. She has been an absolute force of nature in this place. No-one was ever bored when Senator Lambie was on her feet. I didn't agree with everything that Senator Lambie argued in this place, but you could never say that she did not stand with conviction and courage for the issues that she was raising. I know the last couple of days she's been cursing me every time she's seen me—I was born about 10 kilometres from your dad! Your dad was born in a place called Larkhall, which is well known in central Scotland for a number of reasons. I think you've demonstrated the toughness of people from Larkhall in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you first came here as part of the PUP group with Clive Palmer, you quickly understood and had the sense to disassociate yourself from that party. That was one of the first good decisions you made in this place. You overcame massive personal and family challenges and you took that in your stride here. You became an advocate for a whole range of issues from your personal experience, which is always a good way to bring about arguments in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You came to understand the importance of collective bargaining and the importance that the trade union movement plays in making sure that working people get decent rights and decent conditions at work and are treated with respect when they go on the workshop floor. You were understanding of the need for workers to have penalty rates. You didn't need anybody to argue that point—not like some, like Senator Hanson, who had to be convinced that this was the thing to do. You knew that immediately. You knew the importance of penalty rates to working families. You've stood up for working families on industrial relations. You've stood up for the veteran community. You have done an immense job while you've been here. I've personally found you to be extremely trustworthy in the dealings I've had with you. As I've said, I was never bored when you were on your feet in this place—not like I am many times in this place! You always kept us well entertained and focused on the issues that were important to you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought you were treated disgracefully in this place by a number of those opposite. The way you were treated as a working-class woman coming here, arguing your point, I thought was awful. I'm glad that on some of the occasions I was here to support you when you were on your feet against some of the terrible propositions that were put in here as to your motivation and the way that you conducted yourself. I always thought it was very, very good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think you are a tough, uncompromising, working-class woman, and we need more like you in here. Less lawyers, more Lambies, I think. I think you've made a great contribution. I don't think you're finished, from my discussions with you. I feel for you, Jacqui. I feel for your staff and your family. It's a tough time that you're going through. If I personally can be of any help, I certainly offer that. And, on behalf of Labor, we want to thank you for the contribution that you've made in this place. As they say, thanks for the memories, because they're burned in there on some of your contributions. Thank you.</span>

Thank you for reminding the Australian public and us who represent the Australian public that, in order to be an effective politician, you need the fire in the belly. As Senator Cameron referred to, you came from a place where you could have quite easily been forgiven for throwing your hands up and saying: 'You know what? These are the cards life has dealt me, and that's just bad luck.' But no, not as far as Jacqui is concerned—there is no bad luck; there's only hard work. And your hard work has achieved so much, particularly for the veteran community, which you have fought so tirelessly for in your time here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to make the commitment to you on behalf of the Nick Xenophon Team that all of the invaluable work that you did, particularly around the report into veterans' suicides, will not be forgotten and that we will continue on, that this place will continue on to achieve everything you wanted to for the veterans who fought for our country and who feel like they've been given up on. So thank you. I'll miss you as my next-door neighbour. I wish you all the best.</span>

You were a whirlwind when you came in. I think we demonstrated to each other that we have more in common than we oppose. I remember you coming in and us locking horns on forests, for example, and the Greens were probably almost the devil incarnate, but we got to understand you a lot better and you, I think, got to understand us a lot better. I've really valued working with you on all the issues that we have dealt with on social security and income support. I think it's fair to say that we more often than not spoke with one voice around that. You brought your lived experience, which was so valuable, to this place.</span>

One time I had to race up and save one of the motions, and Jacqui rang my office and said, 'What sort of chocolate does Rachel like?'

I know very well that we will be working together again at some stage, and I've really valued the work that you have done in this place. I don't agree with everything, but I think that you've shown this place what it's like to have crossbenchers in here and what we can achieve. I, likewise, commit to the same issue that Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore has just committed to. We worked together on veterans' suicide. We achieved a lot, and we've got a lot more to go.</span>

Mate, we've had lots and lots of discussions about a lot of things, including, obviously, in my portfolio as minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. You're the first Aboriginal Tasmanian to be in that place, and you've assisted me through so many of those matters, and we've had lots of deep and meaningful discussions which I think sometimes remain unresolved, as they do for many Australians.</span>

You're another person who, through absolutely no fault of your own and through absolutely no mischief, has come to this particular place, because you've had the opportunity to clear these things up—you've come to an election twice in this place. So that is the most unfortunate of circumstances.</span>

I think you've been there and you've been able to deal with very specific matters, and I think you've been very effective in that regard. Tasmania is a small place and it has 12 senators, but it is a place that I think always feels a bit behind the yards, and you've managed to take them in front of the stalls to ensure that they're being heard all the time. You can't ask much more to be a senator in this place.</span>

I know you'll have a couple of months off. If you're not going to, just make it a rule—'I'm taking a couple of months off.' Enjoy all those things you love. Go and spend some time with your kids, who I'm sure will be very proud of your achievements. You've made an absolutely unique and remarkable contribution to this place. Thank you.</span>

Senator Lambie, when you first came to this place we were neighbours, and I had the office next door to you, and we shared some interesting times. I was pleased that in some small way I was able to assist, particularly in those early times. It is a difficult time that you are facing, and it's been compounded by other issues, including family issues. Regrettably, I myself understand the slings and arrows, often, of politics, but I also understand the citizenship, the office and all of these things that you're now facing. I wish you well. As some of my colleagues have said, I'm sure we'll hear more about Jacqui Lambie in another time and in another place, but for now I wish you and your family all the very best, and I know I speak for my husband, John, as well. We wish you all the very best.</span>

I'm based in the north, as is Jacqui. We've had a very good relationship over the years. Some of it's been covert and some of it's been not so covert.

But I do believe that you've come to this place and you've dealt with the really serious issues, and I would say that you've been on the progressive side of politics—well and truly on the progressive side of politics. So I've enjoyed my time with you and I've got no doubt there'll be times in the future where we'll work together again.</span>

I think everyone around the room has said so much about the strength that you have brought to this place, Jacqui. But let me say, as a woman in this place, you have shown absolute dedication to the job, passion for the people you represent and the guts to do this job well. And I love your guts, Jacqui. You show everyone that if you believe and you have the strength to stand up and the opportunity to do it, you do it. You're a strong woman. You're a fighter. And that is what we all should be striving for. That's what Australians want in our politicians. So I'm really sad to see you go, and I'm going to be very happy to see where you end up next.</span>

As a Tasmanian senator, Jacqui, thank you—thank you for representing Tasmania and for being such a fierce and courageous woman representing the people of Tasmania. As your fellow Senate colleague, we may have not always agreed on the best way forward for some parts of Tasmania but also for Australia, but you always took the time to listen, and I think we shared that mutual respect for representing Tasmanians as best we could in this place. And you gave it your all—your absolute all. Not only that; you came with an incredible amount of experience as a woman and, particularly, as a single parent, and the things that you've had to deal with in your life, in raising your kids, and you've shared so much about what it means to be a real person. I think the more real people we have in this place then the better it will be, indeed. And you have certainly set the bar for that. So thank you so much for representing Tassie and for being such an effective senator and a courageous woman, and I'm sure you will be back.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I'd like to just say a few words to Jacqui, because I've been in this chamber the entire time that she has been sitting here with us. We've had lots of contributions acknowledging how strong she is and how courageous she is. She's a real person who represents Tasmanians. She represents them with her heart. But I have to say, too, and give her full credit: she has grown so much as an individual. She has contributed greatly to our debates. She has been a real person who has stood up, because she understands, as I do, what it's like to live on government benefits—to try and make ends meet; to actually have to make choices about whether or not you pay your rent on time or give your kids lunch money. They're real and everyday experiences that too many Australians are still having to face. But I also wanted to say, in terms of your contribution: whether it was in committee meetings or in negotiations with the government, and I know from our own side, that, as Doug Cameron said, you've always been very honest; your word is your bond. And I think you can leave this place with your head held high, because you have made a real contribution. I know you have a lot of support in Tasmania and I'm sure, now that you've well and truly found your voice at a political level, we haven't heard the last of you.</span>

You have been very open and very honest with the difficulties that you and your family have worked through together. On behalf of Tasmanian Labor senators, I pay tribute to you for everything you've contributed here.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  When Jacqui came here she hit the ground running; there's no doubt about that. She made her voice heard loud and strong. You didn't have to read between the lines with Jacqui. She also tore through Tasmania. Everyone down in Tasmania has regard for Jacqui, whether or not they're on her side of politics and whether or not they're on her side of the issue she is advocating for. There is no-one who would say Jacqui didn't work hard, wasn't passionate or didn't follow up with everything she said she would do. I think it was Doug Cameron, in his contribution, who indicated that with Jacqui you know where you stand. If you have a promise from Jacqui, she keeps it. That integrity is what Jacqui has shown here in the policies she has pursued and in dealing with other senators in the chamber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that Jacqui said in her contribution—and I'm sure she'll agree with me now—was that she has changed since she first walked into this chamber. She said in her contribution that senators in this chamber aren't all bad. I'm not sure she thought that when she first arrived, but certainly Jacqui has changed. The things that haven't changed are her commitment to Tasmania, her commitment to veterans and her commitment to doing what she says she is going to do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank you, Jacqui. I hope all goes well for you in the future and I wish you, your family and your staff all the very best. As everyone has indicated here, and as I think we all know and the media know, this is not the last of Jacqui Lambie.</span>

I know her father, I know her mother and I feel like I've known Jacqui for all those years. I had known her for a long time before she came in here. I do wish her all the best. I agree with all of her colleagues who have spoken before me. As I said, I have known Jacqui for a number of years, and I don't know that Jacqui has changed that much. I think she has grown into the role; that's certainly what I've noticed. I think she has a lot of support.</span>

I've got to know a number of Jacqui's staff and I certainly feel for them today, because this is difficult. It's difficult for Jacqui but it's always difficult for the people who are staff in the background.

As I said to her a moment ago: I hope that you keep doing that, Jacqui; I'll rely on you for that! Thank you for that, but thank you also for everything you've done here for the people of Tasmania and for what you've brought to the Senate. Like you, I grew up in Ulverstone. I came out of a processing factory. We're probably cut from the same cloth, to some degree. So I recognise that this is difficult for you. I give you my best wishes for the future and wish you everything that you wish for. Thank you for your involvement here.</span>

I think that's a very apt description of you. You've brought such a passion to this place. I think that Australians have really appreciated the clarity of your voice. You speak as you see it, and the voice of northern Tasmania has been well served by the words that you've put on the record in this place.</span>

What a different time that was, and how much learning was ahead! But from the very beginning you had a passion to make sure that things that were unspoken and things that were not being allowed to be said were said in this chamber with regard to Defence. Prior to that it had only been our own Mike Kelly who I felt had the same sort of passion, and I know you've worked very closely with him to make sure that these matters have been attended to. I give you my word that with regard to mental health and the Defence Force, that I will continue my advocacy and the scrutiny that I've been able to apply. I appreciated your counsel on many of those matters over the many years.</span>

I expect to see you down there; to catch up with you in Stanley and continue our friendship. As many senators have said, the contribution you've made is a job interrupted. You've made a great contribution to this place. And, as a woman, can I say that it's great to see you sitting there, the tears are in your eyes and the care is in your heart. That's a woman's voice, fighting for things that matter. Good on you!</span>

Jacqui, absolutely, you have been a strong and strident advocate for our state. You don't mince words; you say what you mean and you say it strongly, loudly and clearly, as Senator O'Neill said. I have to say that even before I got here that's something I respected about you. I may not have always agreed with you, and we've exchanged views on certain things, but you absolutely did not resile from the points you were trying to make on behalf of the people you represent. And while you were very vocal on matters north-west Tasmania, and did a very good job of that, you did represent the whole state as a senator. You did a very good job. I don't know how you did it, but I saw your car everywhere—with that big head of yours on the side of your vehicle, it was unmissable!</span>

But we have the word 'kaliya', which means 'we'll see you when we see you'. This side of Jacqui's heritage, the Indigenous side, is what I'm most aggrieved to see go. Yes, there is Scottish and Irish—everyone else around here has all of those things—but the history of the first nations peoples, the Indigenous peoples, which is caught up with Jacqui's history, is simply put to one side because we have a Constitution that refuses to recognise the first peoples. And on the crossbench we have stubborn opposition to that recognition. We have a senator who has come from a terrible history of genocide and denial on the one side—and on the Scottish side, no doubt, has links to Braveheart and other people.</span>

We have this legacy that we are going to have to fix. Jacqui's leaving means the rest of you bear this responsibility—along with me and Senator McCarthy, from the Northern Territory. This is not only a moment to recognise and praise you, Jacqui, as people have done today, and acknowledge the great work you have done for veterans and others and the privilege of being in your company; it is also a day for us to think about our Constitution, let alone recognition of the first peoples. For so many conservatives in this part of the world, it is a case of 'if it isn't broken, don't fix it'. Well, friends, we've got some issues here! Today is a reminder that that side of Jacqui's heritage is also being denied, as well as her rights as an Australian who fought for this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DT6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. As has already been indicated, the Greens will be supporting these bills. But I want to take the opportunity to reflect further, for the information of the Senate and in particular on behalf of the people of Queensland, on some of the underlying issues that these bills, in only a very small part, seek to address. I would remind the Senate that this legislation seeks to make a very small move to deal with one aspect of the tax laws relating to negatively geared property. It also implements a vacancy tax on properties owned by foreign investors. From the Greens point of view, and from my point of view in Queensland, even a minor tightening up of negative gearing is a good thing. But this is very much a matter of tinkering at the edges of a massive problem that has been highlighted over and over again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, as somebody who came back into this chamber yesterday after a nearly 10-year break, I have had cause to reflect on some of the things that have changed and some of the things that seem very much the same. It was indeed over 10 years ago in this place—28 March 2007, to be precise—that I moved as a matter of urgency in this chamber the need to develop an affordable housing strategy, because of the massive crisis in housing affordability for people seeking to buy a home and people renting their own home. That was a crisis 10 years ago. It's worth noting that the issue for that matter of urgency was urgent 10 years ago, but other parties in the Senate voted against that proposal to develop an affordable housing strategy. If it was urgent 10 years ago, as it undoubtedly was, it is twice as urgent now, but the lack of action has been astonishing at both federal and state level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The area of negative gearing in particular is one that has been flagged time and time again, so much so that the Hawke government in its very early days, back in the 1980s, recognised this and abolished it before caving in to the political power—the donations and the money—of the developer lobby. It passed this chamber at the time with the support of the Australian Democrats, but was then reversed by decision of the Labor government, who didn't have the courage to follow through on it. Ever since that time, that running sore has caused continuing, growing failure in the housing market in this country, because, under the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties at state and federal level, housing policy has in effect been privatised. Perhaps alongside access to food, access to safe, secure, affordable stable housing has to be one of the most basic human rights every Australian could have, yet that has basically been contracted out to the market—a perfect case of profits being put before people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the very last things I was part of when I was in this chamber last time around, in 2008, was a select committee inquiry set up by this Senate into affordable housing. It was chaired by Senator Marise Payne, who I'm pleased to see is still in this chamber in a more senior role with the current government, and produced a series of recommendations. My current colleague Senator Rachel Siewert was also part of that inquiry. That inquiry recommended that there needed to be a significant, proper review of the tax treatment of negative gearing, of the capital gains tax discount for people who are property investors and of capital gains tax exemptions for residential property, yet 10 years later we've had no action at federal level in regard to these taxation measures until this very small action just now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At state government level in a number of states, under both Liberal and Labor governments, the massive impact of property developer donations and the property developer industry more broadly is notorious, so much so that the one area where we've had advancement in political donation reform has been the banning of political donations from property developers in New South Wales, and in my own state of Queensland just in the last month or so as a result of yet another scandal at local government level and of an inquiry into that by the Crime and Corruption Commission, which recommended banning donations from property developers to political parties at local government level. I would acknowledge that the state Labor government accepted that recommendation and sought to expand it to political parties at state level, not just for local government, but it then decided to call an early election before legislating to bring the ban into place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation—a minor incremental tightening of what let's not forget is a massive tax break for property investors in the area of negative gearing—is a small, welcome development. Negative gearing is clearly massively regressive. It costs tens of billions of dollars of foregone revenue that could otherwise be invested directly into affordable housing. This is the approach that the Greens propose, and it is the approach the Queensland Greens have explicitly proposed in this coming state election—that is, to put a massive direct investment of funds into building affordable housing for the public, for public and community housing, straight away. The money can be raised, it can be provided, particularly if you have state and federal governments working together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the vacancy tax that's proposed here on properties owned by foreign investors—it's a step forward of sorts. Certainly a vacancy tax is a great idea, but it should apply to all investor-owned properties, not just those from abroad. In effect, we've got this government trying to use this measure to blame somebody else again. They're trying to blame overseas investors for their own failures in housing. My own state of Queensland is facing a housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders are homeless, are on the social housing waiting list, are facing severe mortgage stress or are completely locked out of the housing market altogether. People are having to pay significant rents under a tenancy law regime where they do not have security over their own home and can be forced to move at quite short notice, with no control over the place they call home. Meanwhile, the wealthy few are allowed to have their houses remain vacant. We have a situation where there are more vacant houses today in my own city of Brisbane than there are homeless people across the entire state of Queensland. Those homeless people don't really care if that vacant house is owned by a property investor who lives overseas or a property investor who lives next door. They care that the house is vacant at a time when we have 20,000 Queenslanders who are homeless and 29,000 people on the social housing waiting list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tightening up negative gearing, slightly, and introducing a constricted vacancy tax are good things as far as they go, but with this bill we see the government tinkering around the edges rather than taking meaningful action that will get to the systemic problems that have been embedded and allowed to grow worse and worse with the massive market failure in this most fundamental area of social policy. Tonight there will be tens of thousands of Queenslanders sleeping rough, camping in their cars, couch surfing—and they all deserve better. They deserve a government, they deserve politicians and they deserve political parties that are committed to putting people before profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, the Queensland Greens have outlined a bold vision for the state election that's happening the weekend after this—voting is already happening in that election—to ensure every Queenslander has a home and that meaningfully addresses the failures of the housing market, which has failed for everybody except for property developers and investors. We need to make affordable housing and the provision of housing for everybody the Medicare of the 21st century. In the same way that we recognise we need to have governments and policies and legislation that ensures that all Queenslanders, all Australians, can access education, can access health care, we recognise they also should be able to access an affordable, safe, secure home. The Queensland Greens would see the establishment of a new Queensland housing trust dedicated to this goal. Within the first 10 years, that trust would invest $60 billion to finance the construction of 200,000 affordable homes and, based on the jobs figures of the Queensland Housing Strategy, would produce more than 16,000 jobs at the same time as producing affordable housing for so many Queenslanders to move into—those 29,000 people who are currently on the waiting list, many of them who have been on that list for years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens Queensland housing trust would be supplemented with revenue from our proposed increases to mining royalties under our fair share plan and through the introduction of a tax on all deliberately vacant properties, not just on those who have investors from abroad. This would combine to provide a $10 billion boost during the first 10 years of construction. The Greens are proposing investment in beautiful, sustainable homes where people can live with dignity. I saw in the newspaper in my hometown of Brisbane, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sunday Mail</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> that apparently this was a source of horror: apparently providing beautiful, well-planned, affordable housing for everybody in Queensland was some East German Cold War nightmare. It might have something to do with the fact that it's not just the two political parties of the establishment who rely so much on the real estate industry and property developers; perhaps the corporate media's desperate reliance on money and advertising from the property industry and from the real estate industry might also be a reason they're so keen to be a mouthpiece for the Property Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are interested in being a voice for everyday Queenslanders, particularly those Queenslanders who are waiting for safe, secure and affordable housing, those who are having to choose between being able to pay the rent or put food on the table, and those who aren't sure whether they're going to be evicted from their home at the end of the year or whether they have long-term security of tenure in their homes. That is why the Greens have also proposed significant reforms to the tenancy laws in my home state of Queensland: to provide that security of tenure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes me back to those times 10 years ago when I was in this chamber repeatedly asking the government of the day and Senator Minchin, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time—I think he was the Minister for Finance—about this issue of affordable housing. I asked what the federal government was going to do about it. Time<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>and time again his only answer—his answer No. 1—was to blame the states. That's a pretty standard approach for federal governments on most things. His second one was: 'Well, we keep interest rates low. That's the way you deliver affordable housing.' That has been shown to be economically illiterate. We have recently had the lowest interest rates in Australia year after year. It used to be a stick that the Liberal government used to beat the Labor Party and others over—that somehow there would always be lower interest rates under a Liberal government, as though this would deliver affordable housing. We've now had lower interest rates again for years and the housing affordability crisis is worse than ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The so-called economic logic behind the so-called good economic managers of the coalition government is once again shown to be a complete facade and as hollow as their words. It also showed a total lack of concern, or even probably awareness, of the huge number of Australians—the huge number of Queenslanders—who rent their own home. I am one of those people. Certainly, it's not something that anybody should feel the need to try and hide. It is something that many, many people do for all sorts of reasons, but it is a reality of the situation that our laws in all states to varying degrees are very much biased towards the property owner and against the private tenant. That is another reason why the Greens, both in this chamber at the federal level and in state parliaments around the country, have pushed for the strengthening of the rights of tenants under tenancy law. It's an example of why it is so important to have Greens in state parliaments: to be able to push the envelope, and to be able to push the other parties and whoever's in government at the time to go further and act to address the problems of the communities that elect us here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just heard a number of wonderful, heartwarming speeches about Senator Lambie. It's a matter of some disappointment to me that, just as I've got here—unfortunately, at least for the moment—she's gone. One of the key themes of what people said about Senator Lambie was that, as just one person here, through her commitment to push on an issue strongly and consistently and with integrity, passion and belief she was able to get shift across pretty much the entire political spectrum. That is a classic example of how electing even just one Green into the Queensland parliament would massively shift the dynamic in that parliament. That would help to get these issues on the agenda, to get advances in tenancy law reform and to get governments to go back to having a direct responsibility for investing in providing affordable housing for the entire community, rather than, in effect, privatising it and handing it to the market, in an area where the market has failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the reason the market has failed is not just that the rules have been rorted to benefit the property developers and the property industry, who provide so many big donations to the coffers of the two parties of the political establishment, but also that the market itself has been savagely distorted over many years by these federal tax measures. It's been distorted for decades because of negative gearing, and then that distortion got turbocharged at the end of last century by the capital gains tax discount—which, unfortunately, the Labor Party supported at the time to enable it to come into being, because it would not have got through this chamber without the support of the then Labor opposition. Those two tax measures, along with the capital gains tax exemption for residential property, have combined to create a massive market distortion, alongside a set of rules that are already basically biased towards the investor and towards the well-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time—in fact, it is well past time—that we had political parties and political representatives who will once again put forward credible, costed policies that will get quick action to address the housing affordability crisis. As I said at the start, it's a crisis that's been in place for a long period of time, and it's simply got worse and worse and worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in these bills, whilst welcome, really do not go anywhere near the heart of the problem, even in regard to the distortion in our tax regime. We certainly are not seeing from any other political party at state level the sort of policy that the Greens are putting forward: a significant, major, direct, immediate investment in building housing infrastructure for the community, for the public, to address those massive housing waiting lists. It would get people off the streets, end homelessness and produce significant numbers of jobs as well as providing infrastructure for everybody. That is the vision the Greens have for the future. It's the vision the Greens are putting forward to the Queensland election. If we can get good legislative change at federal level alongside it, we really can make the housing affordability crisis a thing of the past.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DASTYARI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeover Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. I am pleased to say on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting these pieces of legislation. We're certainly not going to stand in the way of these bills. But we're also not under any kind of real illusion about just how little these measures will do for housing affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing affordability is a huge issue, if not the No. 1 issue, for a generation of young Australians. A generation of young Australians rightly feel that they have been excluded from the Australian housing market, and it's incumbent on government to realise the psychological impact that this has had on this generation of young Australians. There is something fundamental about Australian identity that comes with owning your own home. It's part of our nature. It's part of our culture. While people will point to Europe and other places where homeownership rates and home occupancy rates have been a lot lower, they're actually looking at a culture that is very different in relation to housing. It is a culture that relates much more to people investing in longer term rental arrangements. We don't have that in Australia, and we've never had that in Australia. While it's great to look at some of the European examples, the reality is that that is actually pointing to a cultural phenomenon that is very alien to a lot of Australians out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at what's really happened with property prices in a place like Sydney—and across the country but, I think, in particular in Sydney—you realise there is this disadvantage that's there because of the fundamental issue of capital gains tax and negative gearing, which is at the heart of these problems. I accept that this has been an incredibly difficult issue to deal with in politics. It's always difficult to look at taking away an entitlement that people have. In the Labor Party policy proposal, it's not a retrospective policy; it will only be a prospective policy. I note that other parties—and I note the Greens are here in the chamber—have a version of this that looks at some retrospectivity as well. I acknowledge that that is a very hard thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of people who have chosen to invest in property as their form of superannuation. Without drawing stereotypes, there has certainly also been a very cultural element to this in places like Sydney where the migrant communities, like the migrant communities that I'm proud to represent, have over many years chosen to invest in property as a bricks-and-mortar type investment as opposed to things like shares and other types of equities that, frankly, probably don't have that kind of certainty culturally that property does. So you end up with a situation where many people have chosen to buy a second or a third property, occasionally for their child—for one of their children as they grow up—or to give them a steady source of income in their retirement. As the value of these properties has skyrocketed in our major cities, it has created a scenario where a lot of people are very wealthy largely on paper rather than in reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that in the part of Sydney that I live in, in the inner west of Sydney, we have seen property prices in double-digit growth year after year after year. Now, what that really creates is two classes of people: those who are in the market and those who are outside. Those who are outside the market, unfortunately, when prices are what they are, don't have the ability to buy in. That creates a real second-class scenario for a lot of them. Frankly, it worries me that a generation of my peers, and certainly the generation that comes after mine, won't be able to buy in the Sydney market if they aren't fortunate enough to have wealthy parents. I note this isn't a phenomenon unique to Sydney. The data seems to demonstrate that parts of Sydney and Sydney as a city as a whole, perhaps, has this worse than anywhere else in the country. But I know it's the same story in many major cities and also in many towns, especially those regional towns that have seen a boom-bust property cycle related to short-term massive increases in economic activity, such as the mining boom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have a more comprehensive proposal than what's been outlined in this bill, although we're not opposing this bill, and that's a capital gains tax and negative gearing policy that would deliver $32.1 billion over 10 years and $565 million over the forward estimates. But let's be clear: this isn't just a revenue-raising measure, though there is a revenue-raising component to it. It's about creating a cultural shift in how we deal with property and what we do with property as a nation. It's about changing the incentives. The Labor Party policy, by not being retrospective, accepts that those who have entered into this market in good faith doing the right thing, with their own savings, should not be punished for the decisions they've made. But prospectively, unless you're purchasing new property to try and create some growth in that space, it shouldn't be and it doesn't need to be retrospective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing affordability is deteriorating in Australia's major cities. In 2012, which is only five years ago, Sydney's ratio of median house prices to median gross household incomes was 6.7 times and Melbourne's was 6.5 times. I want to touch on those figures a bit, because the enormity of them might be lost. In 2012—again, five years ago—prices were already skyrocketing out of control and the ratio of median gross annual income to median house prices was 6.7 times in Sydney and 6.5 times in Melbourne. In June 2017—five years later—that ratio sat at 9.1 times for Sydney and 7.5 times for Melbourne. That is a spectacular growth in property prices that those who are in the market, and those in the market with several properties, are able to benefit from but those who are outside of the market are more and more likely to be forever excluded from it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2012, over the past five years, median dwelling prices in Sydney have increased by 60 per cent and Melbourne prices have increased by 30 per cent. I don't need to tell you that when you relate that to a figure like inflation, you see just how phenomenal those increases have been. Meanwhile, Sydney household incomes are only 18.4 per cent higher and Melbourne household incomes have increased by only 13 per cent. I don't want to be Sydney and Melbourne specific—most other capital cities have seen some change in housing affordability over the five to 10 years based on that metric—but it does appear to be Sydney and Melbourne that have really seen this happen the most. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those who argue, validly, that there is a supply problem that has created some of the housing affordability challenges. There is, or has been, certainly, a supply problem when it comes to land release, nimbyism and people deciding to restrict the growth of properties and property development, particularly in areas close to train stations and closer to the cities where people tend to want to purchase. But that alone is not the problem. There are problems of both supply and demand. I know—through my experiences and the experiences of friends and colleagues, many of whom are in their mid-30s, trying to break into the housing market—the horror stories of people spending weekend after weekend going to auctions, only to be outbid by a property developer, foreign investor or property investor who has access to capital that they don't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put that in perspective: when the median price in Sydney is a million dollars, it means you need to have a deposit of about $100,000 just to get started—that's assuming you can make repayments on a million-dollar property. It means you have to have two very, very good incomes or one extremely extraordinary income—but normally two very, very good incomes—just to make the repayments. Park that for a moment. You will need a $100,000 deposit—usually you are looking at LVR rates, loan-to-value-ratio rates, of 90 per cent. You will probably need some form of mortgage insurance if you don't have 80 per cent, if you only have 90 per cent. On top of that, you will have to find your stamp duty and your up-front payments of $20,000 or $30,000, and  your mortgage insurance can be another $20,000. All of a sudden, you are having to bring to the table somewhere between $100,000 and $150,000 just to be able to buy a million-dollar property, which is the median property price in a city like Sydney. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean? It means that those who are very fortunate to have access to capital—be it because they have wealthy parents or parents who may not be wealthy in terms of liquid income but have property they can borrow against—can borrow against, say, their parents' property or a relative's property to look at those kinds of rates. It means that a generation of people who don't have that, can't. And that only relates to those people who already have access to the market. I worry about all of those who don't have access to the market, who don't have the ability to reach out, who don't have the ability to buy in and who don't have the incredibly deep pockets that are needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very fortunate here. Those of us in the Senate have a take-home income somewhere around $200,000 a year, which is extraordinary by average Australian standards. But for people who are living in a household with two teachers or two nurses or two public servants—people who make an incredible contribution to our society—what we're really saying is that they will be locked out of cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Hobart. Darwin has had some incredible property price growth in recent years and certainly Perth has too, although I note that the rate of growth has cooled off as we come to the end of the mining boom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing affordability is a barbecue stopper at the moment in Australian politics, because it is about the future. It is about our children and about their ability to participate, to be part of this. Part of the challenge of this is a tax system—and it has been a bipartisan approach; it hasn't been something that just Labor has done or just the Liberals have done—that has encouraged property investment, and investment in property has now skewed the market. Fifty per cent of the benefits of negative gearing go to the top 10 per cent of income earners, and 70 per cent of the benefits of capital gains tax concessions go to the top 10 per cent of income earners. Again, we're not saying that these people have done anything wrong. They haven't. They've played by the rules. They've followed the rules. What we are saying is that the rules here are unfair. The rules need to change. Frankly, it's time for the set of rules we have to be reformed and updated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in the bills we have before us in the Senate, announced by the government in this year's budget, disallow the deduction of travel expenses for residential rental property, limit plant and equipment depreciation to outlays actually incurred by investors, and introduce an annual charge on foreign owners of underutilised residential property. These are really good changes. These are good pieces of legislation. What we on this side of the chamber are saying is that we cannot stop at just these measures. We have to go further. We have to do more than what these measures are able to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me not to note that there is no place in New South Wales that has experienced the challenges of increasing property prices more than the area of Bennelong in Sydney. Nowhere is the pain of first home buyers felt more than in the seat of Bennelong in Sydney. This is a seat in Australia where almost 40 per cent of the population have a university degree—15 percentage points higher than the rest of the state or country. This is a seat where 34 per cent of the population are professionals. Yet the 2016 census tells us that 36 per cent of dwellings there are rented—a full five percentage points higher than the national average. Bennelong's households are where mortgages and rents are more than 30 per cent higher than the national average. Let me run that figure again: Bennelong's households are where mortgages and rents are more than 30 per higher than the national average. The aspirational of Bennelong are a great example of Australians struggling with the housing affordability crisis.</span>

As you know, the threat of covert foreign interference is a problem of the highest order and is getting worse. The Director-General of ASIO, which is, of course, the agency primarily responsible for investigating espionage and foreign interference, has advised that foreign intelligence activity against Australia continues to occur on an unprecedented scale. Espionage and covert foreign interference can cause immense harm to our national sovereignty, to the safety of our people, to our economic prosperity and to the very integrity of Australian democracy. And we are increasingly seeing public reports of the insidious effect of covert foreign interference being directed against other liberal democracies as well, whether it be through interference in democratic elections or the stifling of free and open debate within our own community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has already embarked on a significant program of legislative and policy reform to ensure the Australian people and Australia's interests are protected from the threat of espionage and covert foreign interference. In May this year, the Prime Minister asked me to undertake a comprehensive review of Australia's espionage and foreign interference laws. That review has now been completed. Before the end of this year, the government will introduce a comprehensive suite of reforms to address a broad spectrum of foreign interference and covert political influence activity in Australia. Those reforms will include legislation to ban foreign political donations, legislation to enhance and reform the espionage and foreign interference related offences in the Criminal Code, and introducing a foreign influence transparency scheme modelled, in part, on the United States Foreign Agents Registration Act.</span>

We believe that only Australian individuals and organisations should be able to participate in Australian elections, and the government is taking deliberate steps towards banning foreign donations, having developed legislation that we will introduce into the parliament in the spring session. In addition to this, the government will introduce in these sittings a transparency scheme modelled in part, as I said a moment ago, on the United States Foreign Agents Registration Act. That regime will require individuals or institutions to make a declaration if they are acting on behalf of a foreign power to influence the political processes of Australia. For the first time, the public and decision-makers in government will have visibility of the level and extent to which foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes.</span>

As you know, the fact is that the High Court delivered its decision in the section 44 cases, on seven references, on 27 October. As I indicated in my answer yesterday and on previous occasions, Senator Parry rang me the following Monday morning, shortly after 9 am Queensland time, to tell me that, after considering the High Court's decision, he thought he may have a problem and had taken urgent steps to make inquiries in relation to the UK Home Office.</span>

The constitutional crisis around section 44 is destabilising the nation. It is calling into question the legitimacy of this parliament. Let's face it, it makes the parliament look like a joke. We've just seen Jacqui Lambie resign. She did the honourable thing and resigned as soon as she became aware of information that meant she was ineligible. But no-one would question Jacqui Lambie's loyalty to Australia—or Larissa Waters's loyalty to Australia or, indeed, Barnaby Joyce's loyalty to Australia. Minister, given that so many people in Australia come from a multicultural background, will you now commit to the reform of section 44 of the Constitution?</span>

Section 44, on the reading the High Court gave it, which of course we respect and accept, is not in my view appropriate for a multicultural democracy in which 51 per cent of people were either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas. As soon as the decision of the High Court was delivered on 27 October, the Prime Minister announced that he was going to refer the matter of section 44 to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for it to consider what action might be taken to ameliorate or mitigate the effects of the operation of section 44 as found by the High Court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not being prescriptive. There are a number of options available. One option that is favoured by some is to consider a constitutional referendum. That is not the government's policy but, plainly, it is an option that should be at least canvassed if there is a review by a parliamentary committee of this issue. Another option that needs to be canvassed or at least thought about is the possibility of legislative reform to Australia's domestic citizenship law, particularly in relation to the circumstances in which an Australian citizen might renounce an unwanted foreign citizenship. So that is what the government is doing about the matter, Senator Di Natale. There is one point, though, about which I differ from you: there is no constitutional crisis, there is no political crisis; there is the unexpected effect of a decision of the High Court which has resulted in both houses of the parliament now having had members resign or be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns.</span>

As I say, we accept and respect that, but Senator Parry, in the circumstances, thought the right thing for him to do was to wait until the law was clarified.</span>

I thank the senator very much for the question, Mr President, because part of our engagement with the Philippines in recent times has been recognising the spread of Daesh in our region and the threat that it directs to Australia and to our interests. That is why, as a government, we are also committed to supporting the government of the Philippines to ensure that it is enabled to address the growing threat of terrorism in our region and indeed on its own shores. Australia acknowledges that the efforts that have been made to defeat the terrorists have come at great cost to the people of Marawi and to the armed forces of the Philippines, and we are committed to supporting the Philippines in this fight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the Philippines Secretary of National Defense, Delfin Lorenzana, and I agreed to a range of new measures to increase our cooperation to ensure that the Philippines armed forces are able to defeat the challenges presented by Daesh-inspired terrorists and the like. ADF training teams are indeed now in the Philippines providing urban warfare counterterrorism training that builds upon the counterterrorism and counter-violent-extremism capabilities of the armed forces of the Philippines. I'm pleased to say, Mr President, that the first group of approximately 250 Philippines armed forces personnel completed the urban warfare training course just on Saturday, last weekend. This is the first of many groups that will participate in the training, helping to build the Philippines' long-term ability to counter terrorism threats and to fight these threats in a different context to what may have been their historic experience, particularly in relation to their skills in jungle warfare vis-a-vis urban warfare in this case. We value our longstanding and close defence relationship with the Philippines, and we are very committed to ensuring that we avoid the spread of terrorism.</span>

The spread of Daesh in this region represents a risk to our collective security and our collective prosperity. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Defence white paper</span>, Australia committed to increasing international defence engagement, particularly in countries in South-East Asia and the South Pacific. We have an extensive program undertaken by the ADF of counterterrorism engagement and capacity-building activities with our regional partners, which includes, for example, special forces training exercises with Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, India, Singapore, Japan and Brunei, and counter-IED training with the Royal Thai Armed Forces and the Royal Thai Police. Those are just some examples. We very much value those strong counterterrorism relationships that we've built with our regional partners. We recognise that effective regional cooperation is vital to defeat the threat of terrorism in the Indo-Pacific.</span>

My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. After failing to attend a supplementary budget estimates spillover hearing of the Senate Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee on 27 October, the minister has refused to make herself available to give evidence to the committee until after parliament rises for the year. Given the gravity of the issues facing the minister, why won't the minister just front up to the committee and come clean?</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, we're already seeing an impact. Last month, Adani announced that thousands of jobs would be based in Rockhampton and in Townsville—it is a very important development for the people of North Queensland—and on the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Morning Bulletin</span> this morning they report that the Rocky region is seeing the Adani factor hit, and that vacancy rates are down. In June this year, the vacancy rate in Rockhampton was seven per cent for landlords. That was one of the highest in the state of Queensland. Last month, it was reported at four per cent—already falling—and there was positive news from the Adani Carmichael mine. A real estate agent from Rockhampton, Tara, says, 'There'll no doubt be rewards for landlords from the FIFO jobs announced, just as there will be rewards for the wider business community through the economic boost of employment.' And real estate agency owner Pat O'Driscoll says, 'Contracts are already being signed all over Rockhampton, with increased interest in the region as a whole.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is exactly what the people of Rockhampton need. They need an economic shot in the arm. That is why we on this side of politics are not shy in supporting the jobs and investment that they need. When I walk down the middle of East Street in Rockhampton, people want jobs, they want employment, they want more business coming to the town. And that's why they want a political party that stands up for their desires and their beliefs, and does not sacrifice their interests to chase inner-city votes in other cities. If you want to represent the people of Central Queensland, you've actually got to act on what they want—and what they want is jobs and investment. They want a political party that stands up for what they need in the future—and we are not shy of doing that.</span>

Today in the Gladstone <span style="font-style:italic;">Observer</span> two local residents, Lawrie and Carol Kyte, said they were considering voting for Labor for the first time at this election but only if they supported the Adani Carmichael mine. Unfortunately for the Labor Party, they pulled their support for that mine and that project. What Lawrie and Carol Kyte want is a better future for their children. They have two sons who currently have to fly in and fly out to the Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia. They would prefer that their sons had jobs close to them, but the Labor Party doesn't support that desire. Lawrie Kyte said in the paper, 'Anyone who is going to turn down thousands of jobs is crazy.' But that is what the Labor Party are doing.</span>

We're rock-solid in our support for jobs in Central Queensland and North Queensland—and joining us is the former mayor of Rockhampton, Margaret Strehlow, a high-profile member of the Labor Party who unfortunately failed in preselection due to factional deals. Margaret says that the Adani mine is 'a generational opportunity for us'. She said: 'We see this as an entrepreneurial opportunity to service the Galilee, not just this mine but for others as well.' Well, I too am happy to stand with former members of the Labor Party in supporting the Adani Carmichael mine. The former mayor of Rockhampton hasn't left the Labor Party; the Labor Party has left her. The Labor Party has deserted Rockhampton. They used to support Central Queensland. They used to support beef jobs. They used to support mining jobs. But now they are too busy chasing votes in Brisbane to duly represent the people of Central Queensland. So I'll stand with Margaret and the people of Central Queensland and get this mine and these jobs going.</span>

I'm glad you've raised the question of the postal survey because, on any view, the postal survey has been an outstanding success. I want to take the opportunity you afford me, Senator Hinch, to congratulate my colleague Senator Mathias Cormann, who was the Acting Special Minister of State at the time the postal survey was conducted, had superintendence of it and did a magnificent job. We will find that 80 per cent or so of the Australian electorate has participated. As the government said at the time: whether you favour reform of the Marriage Act or whether you want to maintain the status quo, the important thing was that people should have their say—and they have had their say in droves. I don't want to anticipate what the result will be when it's announced at 10 am tomorrow because the government has been very, very careful to respect the process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hinch, you ask about two private senators' bills that have been foreshadowed by my colleagues Senator Smith and Senator Paterson. What the Prime Minister has always said and what I've always said is that, in the event that there were to be a yes vote, then the government would facilitate a parliamentary debate on a private member's bill—or perhaps it will be a private senator's bill. That will be a matter for the private members or senators concerned and a matter for the chamber.</span>

Minister, you'll appreciate that I'm a Queensland senator and I'm a little parochial, so I would ask if you could perhaps focus on my home state of Queensland.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I thank Senator Macdonald, who has always been very action oriented when it comes to policies to put downward pressure on electricity prices across Australia, particularly in his home state of Queensland. Indeed, the Turnbull government has been delivering comprehensive reform to put short-term downward pressure on electricity prices and, indeed, long-term downward pressure on electricity prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We delivered reform in terms of the way gas markets operate that have seen the spot price in relation to gas reduced thanks to the Prime Minister's direct intervention into those markets—not only reduction in prices but also an increase in supply, helping to feed that reduction in prices and guaranteeing there is more affordable gas in the market in the future. Intervention, in terms of the retail market, has seen big retailers give almost two million Australians more information to choose better energy plans. Indeed, half a million Australians have visited the government's Energy Made Easy website. As an example, a Brisbane household has reported making changes worth some $630 a year as a result of advice provided by the government to them as to how they can best access cheaper electricity prices into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't stop there. Through our National Energy Guarantee there are longer term downward pressures that will play out in the energy market; estimates of bringing wholesale prices down by some 20 to 25 per cent, relative to what they would otherwise be; savings of, potentially, $5 million for an energy-intensive industrial user; or, of course, our reform to the limited merits review, changing the way in which those poles-and-wires network distributors work. In the Queensland case that is critical, because we know that the Palaszczuk Labor government has been ripping off energy users in their home state by dragging money out of their energy network systems and abusing this process. We have now put a roadblock to that occurring in the future.</span>

Whether you're in Townsville or Far North Queensland, western Queensland or the more urbanised area of Queensland, it's essential for businesses to be able to open their doors with confidence, invest with confidence and, of course, employ with confidence. The mistake made too often, particularly by those opposite—or, indeed, by some state governments—has been to consider parts of energy policy in isolation. The approach the Turnbull government is taking is to recognise that you have to deal with every aspect of the energy market: retailers, distributors, wholesalers, generators. You also have to deal, of course, with all of the different policy impacts on it: international obligations, reliability, affordability. And you cannot do any of those things in isolation, which is why our approach, our Energy Guarantee, is about tackling them all in a fully integrated manner.</span>

They claim it will be cost-neutral, which is the most preposterous and unbelievable claim going around. Don't take my word for it, though. The Grattan Institute has said that Queensland Labor's policy is an 'economic illusion'. The Australian Energy Council has said that Queensland consumers and taxpayers will ultimately pay the price. Indeed, even the Queensland Council of Social Service has said there will be consequences for consumers in terms of higher retail energy prices. What is very clear is that, under these types of ad hoc approaches the likes of which the Palaszczuk Labor government are applying, consumers will pay a price; businesses will pay a price. Ultimately, there will be fewer jobs and higher prices for electricity, and that will be terrible, devastating news for the state of Queensland.</span>

Senator Singh, really—if you wonder why you're on that side of the chamber and we're on this side of the chamber, it's because all you're interested in is political intrigue. You have no interest whatsoever in policy. Meanwhile, Senator Singh, the government has, since its election, presided over the creation of 825,000 new jobs in this country. Since the beginning of this year, we have seen the greatest rate of jobs growth in Australia in more than 23 years, and 85 per cent of those new jobs created since the beginning of this year have been full-time jobs.</span>

Meanwhile, I might say, if I can expand on Senator Birmingham's remarks, the LNP in Queensland has announced its own energy policy, which will see the reduction in electricity prices to Queensland households of up to $460 per year.</span>

Here we are: the House of Representatives isn't sitting this week, so the only parliamentary chamber, the only question time for the Australian Labor Party to prosecute its policies—to ask penetrating questions of the government about policies—is here in the Senate. We're only 15 minutes from the end of question time and you have run out of serious things to say. You haven't asked a question about the economy. You haven't asked a question about national security. You haven't asked a question about jobs. You haven't asked a question about energy or economic security. You haven't asked a question about international relations. You haven't asked a question about defence. You haven't asked a question about the cost of living. You haven't asked a single question on any serious policy issue for the whole of this question time. You are a joke!</span>

In this question time you started off by asking an asinine question of Senator Fifield which was entirely based on a false premise. Then you went on to ask a question of me, again based on a false premise. Then you tried to pursue Senator Cash with two questions: first of all from Senator Cameron, the old class warrior over there, in which you were slammed, and then from the ambulance chaser sitting on your right, Senator Murray Watt, again to Senator Cash, and you were slammed again. You haven't asked a single serious question in this question time and the Australian people have worked you out.</span>

My question is to the Acting Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Cash, and it is, in fact, about policy. Given that we are at the start of Innovation Week in 2017, can the minister update the Senate on how the Turnbull government is helping Australian businesses stay at the cutting edge of innovation and be globally competitive?</span>

What it's going to do in relation to small and medium enterprises is enable them to incorporate the latest technologies into their operations and embrace digital innovation, including the Internet of Things, big data, data analytics, robotics, sensors and automation.

The government is committed to ensuring that Australia is a globally competitive exporter not just of products but also of intellectual property and research. Our National Innovation and Science Agenda has been helping the science and business communities do just that. Through our Global Innovation Strategy, the government have established five 'landing pads' for our young, fast-growing companies to access new markets and establish international profiles. In a recent survey of landing-pad participants, 100 per cent of respondents expect to achieve a commercial outcome as a result of participating in this program. The Global Connections Fund has provided over $2.8 million for our local businesses and researchers, in particular to collaborate with over 20 countries, including Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, the UK and the USA.</span>

This minister is an absolute disgrace. This minister sacrificed her own minder, one of her own senior staff, to save her own skin. That's what this minister did. She has no credibility and no capacity to stand up here and argue any point on industrial relations portfolios, because she is an absolute fraud. She will be found out. She can run all she likes, as she is running out of the chamber now—she can run out of the chamber, but she will be held accountable. She will be held accountable by the Labor Party and she will be held accountable by the Senate because this minister has basically misled this place on at least five occasions. </span>

That's the level that this minister has got to. She has no credibility and absolutely no sense of decency. If she had any sense of decency whatsoever, she would be providing her resignation to the Senate now. When we see good people leaving the Senate and we see Senator Cash still here, it is no wonder the public is sickened by this rabble opposite, led by a weak Prime Minister. She comes in here day after day making up allegations against trade union leaders and against workers defending their jobs and defending their right to put food on the table for their family after being locked out for month after month. </span>

She has not gone anywhere near being accountable to the Senate. She has simply mouthed here allegations that there are no proof of. What she wants to do every time she is asked a serious question is to try and denigrate Labor members, trade unionists and workers out there trying to defend their job. That is common for this mob over here. This lot don't care about workers' rights or decency in the workplace. They simply want workers to be subdued by the employer, come to work every day and accept what the employer says. That's the style of this mob over here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a minister to come here and refuse to answer any questions—this is a minister who can't keep her mouth shut when she is on her feet attacking trade unions. But when she is asked a question about her credibility, about her behaviour, she can't sit down quick enough. She has absolutely no credibility as a minister and absolutely no credibility as a member of the government. She will continue to mislead this Senate because she has got nowhere to go. She was offered, day after day, to come and make herself accountable, and she has refused to do so. She has no courage, no commitment to the Senate, no credibility as a minister. She is a disgrace and she should resign. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Just for those listening in, I actually happened to be the minister at the table whilst Senator Cameron was asking question after question to try to assert the integrity of one Luke Collier who is a criminally convicted individual who worked for the CFMEU. There was a protection racket going for this individual. Now, talking about the minister, Minister Cash, it was accused during question time that the minister was 'in hiding'. That would be like saying Uluru is in hiding. It sticks out. The minister is here and ready, willing and able to answer any specific question that senators had. Indeed, the opposition were given the opportunity of six questions, and all they asked were, 'Why are you in hiding?' when she was clearly, transparently, not in hiding. She was there and present, willing and able to answer specific questions. But, of course, the Labor Party, knowing they had no more material, had nowhere else to go, and so they just threw the slur. That is the way that they do their business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the protection of workers, which Senator Cameron sought to clothe himself with, let me remind the Australian people that he is a frontbencher in a party led by a former trade union leader, Mr Shorten, who has threatened the Australian people to run Australia like a trade union. Now, how do people like Mr Shorten and the trade union movement run a trade union? Well, ask Kathy Jackson; ask Craig Thomson; ask Bruce Wilson—ask Mr Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, in fact, because what he did was a dirty deal to cut the penalty rates of the Chiquita Mushrooms workers to ensure that his union got money at the expense of low-paid workers. The only people that have cut Australians' penalty rates have been Mr Shorten and the Australian Workers' Union. Indeed, the most recent decision of the Fair Work Commission in relation to penalty rates—and let's get the history here—was as a result of deliberate amendments forced through this place by the dying Labor government, when Mr Shorten was the minister, to ensure that penalty rates were specifically looked at. Who looked at those penalty rates, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle? None other than people hand-picked by Labor onto the Fair Work Commission, appointments that I opposed and had indicated to Mr Shorten that I thought were not appropriate. Nevertheless, all of the people on the Fair Work Commission were hand-picked by Labor. Under Labor's legislation and by Labor's own hand-picked individuals, this decision was made. Why? Because they got mugged by the evidence, and the evidence is overwhelming: the higher the penalty rate, the fewer people employed in certain sectors. Might I add: we're not talking about nurses, ambulance people or fire brigades; we are talking only about the hospitality sector. They were mugged by the fact that that costs jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a social justice decision out of the Fair Work Commission designed to give more Australians the opportunity to work, and what does Labor do? They say, 'We will seek to legislate to ensure that more of our fellow Australians stay on the scrap heap of unemployment.' And they claim to be the social justice party. Who do they lead-off with in this debate? The chief defender of the thugs in the CFMEU that Senator Cameron seeks to champion day after day at Senate estimates and in this place. You could never accuse Senator Cash of hiding, and it also highlights that Bill Shorten is unfit for government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  It's no surprise that they'd send Senator Abetz in to talk about this issue, because he has really been the architect of the witch-hunt and pursuit of their political opponents that we've seen from those opposite now for more than four years. The reality of this situation is that it's actually the witch-hunt that they've had and the agenda that they've pursued that have unravelled with the overreach by Senator Cash and her office. I will come back to that in more detail, because I want to outlay some of the facts that we've seen that were outlaid by Senator Cameron—and I'm sure Senator Watt, behind me, will touch on them. They were two of the inquisitors that we saw in Senate estimates when Minister Cash failed to answer the questions, and failed to answer the questions in Senate question time as well. She may be here, but she certainly isn't answering the questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With Senator Cash, the reality is that she has no credibility, misled the Senate on five occasions, refuses to be accountable for ministerial standards, refuses to answer questions now in this chamber and is also refusing to attend another hearing of the estimates before parliament rises so that that can be further scrutinised. That's her record in this regard; that's the record of Senator Cash. It is unacceptable for the leader of government business in here to try to defend that. But there's a broader element to this, and that's the motivation of this government and the conduct of this minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to power more than four years ago, the government and the minister have spent millions of dollars pursuing Labor, pursuing a royal commission and targeting their political opponents with a whatever-it-takes attitude. The fact that they tipped off the media in regard to a raid on the AWU—I don't think that's the first time they've done it. This is really at the heart of what they have done. They use any opportunity, through this, to pursue their political opponents. They've done it, I'm sure, through the royal commission and, indeed, we've seen it in this chamber since I got elected last year. You'd get up and you'd see the front page of the paper: there would be a smear on a union or an individual that would be, no doubt, led by Senator Cash—they'd be there high-fiving in their office. Then the senator would come in here, take a question and smear again. That's what we've seen. This has been the tactic from those opposite. They've done it for four years. For four years they have pursued this, and it is now in tatters. The credibility of this attack is now in tatters. They pursued their political opponents through a royal commission. They did that, thinking it was going to impact on the last federal election campaign. They called a double dissolution on industrial relations issues, yet they never mentioned them again. We've seen over the last month that the credibility of Senator Cash, the lead attack dog on these issues, is in tatters. She didn't get a dixer on it this week—she's been focused on other things. That speaks volumes for how the government sees this and why it had to send in Senator Abetz to try to rebuild its attacks in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the conduct of the staffer who tipped off the media is that there's no doubt that was encouraged within Senator Cash's office. They pursued a political strategy where they would tip off journos, to give them the heads-up, in trying to build a case against their political opponents, using every lever that they had to do it. I dare say they have, to quote a former Labor senator, a 'whatever it takes' attitude when it comes to pursuing their political opponents. That's what Senator Cash was responsible for. That's what her office was responsible for. What did they tell the Prime Minister? Did they fess up to him and say what they were up to when they met before question time? They let the staffer go, they threw him under a bus, but won't actually front up and give the answers that we are demanding and that the Australian public deserve to know in regard to this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll continue to pursue Senator Cash and the others in regard to this, and we will continue to highlight the fact that the smear campaign against their political opponents that they've been pursuing now for four years is in tatters. In Senator Cash they've got a minister who has been at the forefront of this and who has no credibility. They've got a minister who is refusing to answer the questions that we are putting to her in regard to this, both in this chamber and through Senate estimates. And they've got a minister who should live up to the ministerial standards and make the decision to resign, because that is the only way the government can have credibility when it comes to workplace issues and governance in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I think the only thing in tatters in this chamber at the moment is the credibility of the opposition, because what we've seen here is a continuing attack on an effective and highly credible minister of the Crown, one who is performing very ably in her role and who is revealing what the populace of Australia knows about the Australian Labor Party, the current opposition, and its leader: that the links to the union movement are corrosive and destructive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the evidence presented by Minister Cash—credible, extensive evidence—to Senate estimates hearings revealing she was not aware of the AFP raids until they occurred and were reported in television coverage. Senator Cash made it very clear that she was not aware that her staff member had made the tip-off. She was informed, in fact, that there was no such tip-off. Senator Cash has been completely up-front and honest. She has appeared before Senate estimates hearings on this topic, she has presented herself in this place and we have seen extensive questioning from the opposition that has got absolutely nowhere. Why are the opposition continuing their attack on this highly effective and credible minister? Because they are running a protection racket for their leader, Bill Shorten. They're running a protection racket on donations to his own election campaign and on donations made to GetUp! when he was national secretary of the AWU. There are very important questions to be answered in this space and the answers have not been forthcoming from the Labor Party. They attack Minister Cash and they continue their attacks even when the results are proven to be so ineffective in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen so many examples of union members' money being wasted on unauthorised expenditure. Recently there was a union official given a 13-month sentence for spending union members' money on things like hen's parties, botox, kitchens and other personal expenses. And everyone in this place remembers Craig Thomson and what he was using the Health Services Union credit card for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This use of union members' money should be of absolute concern to the Australian Labor Party—to the opposition in this place—but they don't seem to care. They just want to attack Minister Cash; they want to try to run their protection racket on Bill Shorten. What have we heard from the trade union royal commission? The trade union royal commission said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The conduct that has emerged discloses systemic corruption and unlawful conduct, including corrupt payments, physical and verbal violence, threats, intimidation, abuse of right of entry permits, secondary boycotts, breaches of fiduciary duty and contempt of court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the finding of a royal commission, and the reason why the opposition continues to attack Minister Cash is because it doesn't like the findings of the royal commission. It doesn't like the efforts of this government to crack down on union corruption—to pass laws banning secret payments between unions and big business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, millions of dollars of dodgy payments changed hands in exchange for unions selling down workers' pay and conditions. They didn't like the introduction of the ABCC: they didn't like the re-introduction of the ABCC, the industrial watchdog on the block of the building industry, making sure that we try to reduce the level of criminality and negative tactics in the building industry. We've seen massive hypocrisy on penalty rates, where we've seen low-paid workers sold down the river by their union bosses. It's a disgraceful fact that, as a union boss, Mr Shorten cut deals to lower penalty rates, including in the retail and hospitality industries by the same rate the Fair Work Commission is now applying for workers on the relevant awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They stripped penalty rates from low-paid cleaning workers at Clean Event, with no compensation. This is why the opposition continues to attack Minister Cash, one of the most effective and high-quality operators in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I also rise to take note of the answers of Senator Cash during question time. It was very interesting: up until a couple of weeks ago, the last sitting week or so, every day during question time we became used to Senator Cash coming into this chamber—usually on the back of a report that, coincidentally, she'd managed to get into a News Corporation paper that very day—to launch an attack on unions and working people, often based on very flimsy evidence. But it has been very interesting this week that Senator Cash has not decided to do that. She came in today and gave some answer about a question in the portfolio that she's representing another minister in. She has stayed well away this week from her traditional attacks on unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, why would that be? The only reason is that she at least has the self-awareness to understand that from estimates onwards not one person in this country takes anything that she says about unions seriously. The fact that she has launched a partisan campaign, based on flimsy evidence and using every arm of government available to her, against unions and working people was exposed at estimates, once and for all. And from that day onwards, everything that she says about unions, working people and the Labor Party no-one will ever believe again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just quickly remember what happened during estimates. We were all heading into estimates expecting to be asking questions of Minister Cash about her disgraceful handling of the other arm of the government against unions, being the ABCC. We all remember her own hand-picked appointment, Nigel Hadgkiss, who had to resign from his position in disgrace. We barely even got to that in estimates. There we were, ready to ask some questions about that, but Senator Cash and her office managed to concoct something even bigger still—an even bigger distraction from the affairs of the ABCC—and that was in the form of the AFP raid on union offices and the now notorious tip-off to the media by her own office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's well-known now that Minister Cash was asked about this over and over again during estimates, and on at least five occasions she misled the Senate committee as to what she knew and what her office had done in this entire affair. She had opportunities time and time again through that estimates proceeding—during lunchbreaks, morning tea breaks and afternoon tea breaks—she had every possible form of technology known to humankind in front of her and she was on it all day asking all sorts of questions of her office, but she never took the opportunity to ask her office whether the evidence she was giving the Senate was accurate. Do you know why? She didn't want to know the answer. She knew there was something going on there that she didn't want to know the full facts about. We can take only at face value the minister's answers when she said she was not aware that her own office had tipped off the media about the impending police raid on union offices, but there are so many questions that remained unanswered by this minister. They were not answered properly in estimates in any of the sessions. She was unavailable for the follow-up session and is now not making herself available for another estimates session until parliament rises for the year. Even today she has continued to refuse to answer these very legitimate questions that people all around Australia want answers to. She has still not answered, either to the committee or to the Senate, whether other members of her office were aware of the fact that the media were tipped off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked Minister Cash about this on numerous occasions at the first and second estimates committee hearings, and each time she said she was unable to answer. I made it very clear that I wanted to know from her, beyond the one staff member who has resigned in disgrace, which other members of her office were aware that the media had been tipped off about the impending police raid. She has still not answered that question. She didn't answer it in estimates twice and she wasn't able to answer it and wasn't prepared to answer it here in question time again today. Beyond her own office, we still don't have answers as to what role the Prime Minister's office had in this affair. She wouldn't tell us at estimates and she won't tell us here in question time whether members of her office had spoken to the Prime Minister's office about the fact that they were tipping off media. She doesn't want to talk about that, because there's something she's still keen to hide, and today she wasn't prepared to tell us why she hid the truth from the Prime Minister. On the day this story broke she attended a question time briefing with the Prime Minister and misrepresented what one of the shadow frontbenchers, Anthony Albanese, had said on radio. She has been asked repeatedly: why did she mislead the Prime Minister? She continues to say no. We are not going to give this matter up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This constitutional crisis engulfing the government calls into question the very legitimacy of this parliament and strikes at the heart of the community's confidence in our democratic process. People right around the country are looking at this parliament and they think it's a joke. It has become a laughing-stock. They look at the response to the dual citizenship crisis, and they see politicians lying, back-pedalling and obfuscating; they don't see politicians standing up, coming clean and recognising that people in this place have a responsibility to the Australian community. We saw someone today do something which has been quite unique throughout this crisis: Jacqui Lambie stood up, copped it on the chin, recognised that there were questions around her eligibility and resigned. She did it quickly, didn't leave questions lingering, got legal advice, got confirmation from the relevant authorities and did the right thing, the honourable thing, the decent thing. She follows in the path of Senator Waters and Senator Ludlam who, when they were caught up in this crisis, also did the right thing and the honourable thing. They didn't seek to blame other people or to make excuses; they copped it on the chin, took responsibility for their actions and resigned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few things that I would like to say about the matter. The first thing is that no-one would question Jacqui Lambie's, Scott Ludlam's, Larissa Waters's or, indeed, Barnaby Joyce's or Fiona Nash's commitment to Australia. No-one would suggest that they have divided loyalties, and no-one would suggest that they are people who are somehow torn in their allegiance to this country. The reality is that section 44 was written for another era. It's a relic of the past. It's no longer fit for modern, multicultural Australia. This is a nation made up of people from right around the world, which is something we should be immensely proud of. Our Constitution was written at a time when there was a real concern about people having divided loyalties, but that is not the case anymore. When it comes to section 44 of the Constitution and the idea that a dual citizenship is the arbiter of somebody's allegiance to Australia, we know that we have a problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that people like Larissa Waters, Scott Ludlam, Jacqui Lambie, Barnaby Joyce and the others who have been caught up in this are Aussies and that they do express a deep commitment to Australia, and no-one would question that, which is why it's so important that we need to see reform of section 44 of our Constitution. We do need that reform to happen. We do need to commit to doing that. We do need to undergo a process. I was encouraged, it must be said, by the answer given by the Attorney-General who expressed a similar view and said that this was now under active consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That is a good thing. But let's also remember that, while it's there in our Constitution, it is all of our responsibility to uphold it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution is our founding document. It's the foundation of our democracy. If we can't adhere to the Constitution then we shouldn't expect ordinary people to follow the rules that we set for them. The reality is that we can't have two standards: one for people inside this building and another one for people outside this building. That is why the response from the Prime Minister on this issue has been appalling. He initially instructed the High Court that they would adhere to his interpretation of the Constitution and then set a completely different standard for his ministers—one stood aside, yet Barnaby Joyce continued in his role. We saw the former President of the Senate sit on information after confiding in government ministers for weeks, and we have now seen the spectacle of John Alexander resigning as a result of his dual citizenship status. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we need an audit. We need to put this mess behind us. We need to restore faith in our democracy, because right now people right around the country are looking at this parliament and saying, 'You are a joke.' </span>

                  </a>  The coalition government is committed to Operation Sovereign Borders and the policies that have kept children out of detention and prevented deaths at sea. The government will not be lectured to by the Labor Party on border protection. Australians have not forgotten the Labor-Greens border disaster, which saw 50,000 people arrive on more than 800 boats. The tragic mistakes of those opposite saw 8,000 children placed in detention and at least 1,200 lives lost at sea. The government will not repeat Labor's mistakes. Given the close ties between Australia and New Zealand, any resettlement of refugees in New Zealand would have serious implications for Operation Sovereign Borders. The coalition will not weaken our borders and never implement policies which risk putting people smugglers back into business.</span>

The minister failed to arrange for two of the requested four hours of spillover hearings from the May 2017 budget estimates hearings in the available four months between June and October. After the supplementary estimates, opposition and minor party senators requested three hours of spillover hearings for NBN Co. The minister made no effort to accommodate this very reasonable request until this morning when a date next month was offered. I remind the minister that a fellow senator minister can represent him at the spillover hearing.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, really, we are talking about a man who poses a major threat to the security of not just our nation but, indeed, the world—the planet. This is a man who is goading the North Koreans into a nuclear conflict. This is a man who just recently was congratulating Mr Duterte, the leader of the Philippines, a man who has been involved with extrajudicial killings. Approximately 12,000 people are now dead in the drug wars in the Philippines. People have been killed without trial. We are seeing police involved. In fact, Mr Duterte himself was bragging about stabbing a man as a young person. Out here is the President of the US congratulating him, lauding him for his policies. I think to call him belligerent, narcissistic, petulant, misogynistic and racist is bang on the money.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. Labor has denied formality to this motion today because we believe issues such as the one raised by Senator Bernardi in motion No. 548 should not be dealt with by a simple motion of the Senate. It relates to matters of international political history across a number of different countries. We believe that, if you're moving motions like this, there should be the opportunity for substantive debate on the issue by other senators. We do want to cooperate with Senator Bernardi. We notice that there are often a number of motions from him across a wide range of issues. We do like to work with Senator Bernardi but we also feel it's important that when there are motions being put like this where other contributions could be made, or should be made, about these topics they should be dealt with not in general business notices of motion but rather through matters of public importance, private senators' time or general business time.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Gallagher. I do appreciate your extending of the olive branch of cooperation. However, these things are not debated on a regular basis in matters of public importance or at any other time, because people on that side of the chamber, including the Greens and yourselves, seek to game the system to prevent the crossbench from actually getting their motions up. Those of us who only have one vote only get to put one submission in, whereas you, the Greens and others put multiple submissions in, trying to game the system.</span>

                  </a>  So, please, don't lecture me about the opportunities to debate these things. If you want to debate these things, let's have a discussion about it and a debate about it. You can perhaps put the motion in about the merits of communism tomorrow, if that's what you feel like—right? But the fact is that this is an ideology that has destroyed hundreds of millions of lives and you don't want to have a motion where we say that it's terrible and that we should be condemning it.</span>

                  </a>  The government is pleased to note the breaking of the siege of Vienna on 15 October 1529 and is happy to encourage all members and senators to enjoy a croissant today, tomorrow and in the future in remembrance of this important occasion. However, to link this historical event to the present challenge of violent Islamism and the threat it poses to liberal democracies and other faiths is not accepted by the government. Violent Islamist extremism presents one of the most insidious and immediate national security challenges of our time, globally and within our own community. Over the last three years this government has embarked on the most comprehensive program of counterterrorism law reform in a generation to ensure the safety of the Australian people from terrorism.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill I move today is to right a wrong committed by the Senate almost two decades ago to prevent the establishment of a nuclear fuel cycle in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Two decades ago Australia could have established a nuclear fuel cycle, particularly a nuclear energy sector that would, by now, have reached maturity. In particular, nuclear electricity generation could have provided the energy stability, affordability, security and sovereignty that Australia desperately needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Those who are concerned about the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the planet's atmosphere, and the various global efforts to reduce those emissions, also missed an opportunity two decades ago to curtail Australia's emissions by deploying nuclear energy. Nuclear energy results in less carbon dioxide emissions than the photovoltaic and wind generation sources preferred by those concerned about such emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My home state of South Australia has an abundance of uranium which gives us a unique position in the world as a global uranium supplier. In the two decades since this Senate shut the door on a nuclear fuel cycle—followed by a succession of energy policy decisions by major parties—South Australian energy prices have risen to be among the highest in the world. Energy costs have been a significant determinant in the ongoing viability of manufacturing such as the automotive industry, which has now—regrettably—departed South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a painful exercise to consider whether the South Australian economic position would have been vastly different—and more positive—had this Senate made different decisions two decades ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill does not, by any means, open up the nuclear fuel cycle to unregulated development by the private or public sector. Instead, it removes the automatic bans that the Senate inserted into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998</span> to prevent any Ministerial or other approval of critical elements of the nuclear fuel cycle. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Environment Minister will still have to consider applications to establish such facilities under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</span>, and the Foreign Minister retains the power to decide whether or not to issue a permit for a proposed facility under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The passage of this Bill will signal to the world that Australia is—at last—open for business, namely open to considering the evidence, the science, the environmental, employment and economic opportunities of the nuclear fuel cycle.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  There's no other way to describe what is currently happening on Manus Island than as a humanitarian calamity. There are people entering their 15th day today without access to drinking water, food, electricity and much-needed medication, thanks to the instruction given by the Australian government and the Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, to cut off the essentials of life, beginning on 31 October, to well over 600 people. We've then seen Papua New Guinea police and Papua New Guinea immigration personnel go into the camp, overturn water containers, drain precious drinking water into the dust and, yesterday, deliberately drill holes in every water container they could find to stop the detainees from being able to store any rainwater they are able to catch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a humanitarian calamity of bipartisan making. Remember, it was the Australian Labor Party who put every single one of these people on Manus Island in 2013. It is still unexplained why over 1,400 people who were actually on the same boats as the people that are currently on Manus Island and Nauru are here in Australia on various categories of visas, most of them living in the Australian community, while there are still over a thousand on Manus Island, in Port Moresby or in Nauru who are like the corpses that used to be impaled on the walls of medieval cities. It is a sickening, disgusting situation that is a result of a cruel, bipartisan lock step on immigration policy in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: the world is watching in horror. The BBC, Al Jazeera, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Radio New Zealand, <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span>—the list goes on of these global institutional media organisations who are reporting on these humanitarian crises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is the Liberal Party that have been running the detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru with extreme prejudice, in the most punitive and cruel way that they can, since they came to government, but the reason we still have these crises existing is that the Labor Party has forgotten itself. It's forgotten its roots. It's forgotten its compassion. It's forgotten its tolerance. If there is anything left in the famous light on the hill that Ben Chifley used to talk about with such fondness, that light is flickering; it is guttering; and, if it's still alive, it is in imminent danger of extinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I call on Labor Party members—and there are many good members of the ALP, senators and MPs who represent the ALP in this place, who we all know do not in their hearts support this policy—and I say to them: I'm pleased that you're speaking out. We are pleased about that, but it's not words that are going to solve this policy crisis; it is votes in this parliament that will solve this policy crisis. It is bums on seats that make laws in this place. It is the Labor and Liberal parties together who created this emergency by voting in favour of the cruel amendments to the Migration Act in 2013, and it is the Labor Party who have it within their capacity now to solve this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor stood up and voted with the Greens to end this humanitarian nightmare that well over 1,000 people are living on Manus Island and Nauru, the Liberal Party would not be able to stand up against it, because we know that the majority of the Australian people do not support what is going on on Manus Island and Nauru. Poll after poll has shown that over the last couple of weeks. We are seeing civil disobedience in ever-increasing numbers, and we will see more people engage in peaceful protest and civil disobedience in coming days and weeks. So I say to the Labor Party members who don't support this: thank you for speaking out, but please, please, vote with the Greens to end this humanitarian calamity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  It's often not what the Greens say when they speak; it is about the things that they ignore. The Greens often come into this place and argue that laws should be broken. In this case, the good senator forgot to mention that these events are as a result of a ruling of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, so it was an order. For the entire time that I have been here, these people have called for the closing of this detention centre, and, when the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled accordingly that it ought to be closed, of course overnight their voice changed. So it is not just hypocrisy; it is a concerted effort on their part to mislead the people of Australia with respect to these circumstances.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's just get back to the beginning. Come back to the beginning. What happened here was not the making of the government of the day. Fifty thousand people arrived illegally on over 800 boats over a period of time. It was an issue that the government inherited. The policy to put these people on Manus Island was a Greens-Labor policy, and our government had to arrive in government with a mop in one hand and a bucket in the other to clean up this mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would've noted, colleagues, that not once—not once, ever—have the Greens protested about the 1,200 souls being lost at sea. Not once did they ever mention it. They want to talk about a calamity. Twelve hundred men, women and children—people whose names we don't know, in many circumstances—perished at sea, under a policy that the Greens supported in this place for many years. There were over 8,000 children detained, not under this government, but under a Labor government, and it took this government to get these children out of detention. We were able to do that, despite resistance. We're all well aware of the famous evidence by the Human Rights Commission President, who admitted, virtually, to colluding with the Labor Party, while the government was in a transitional phase, to bring criticism and to bring an inquiry onto the incoming government about children in detention. That was despite the fact that, in the early periods of this government, we removed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and got them to the smallest numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These people on Manus Island have choices. They have an opportunity, many of them, to go to the United States. But we have, particularly, Senator McKim up there, falsely misleading these people, so that they are resisting the opportunities that they have. They can settle in Papua New Guinea. They can move to—</span>

                  </a>  Well, they've got the choice already. If they've been determined to be refugees, they can settle in Papua New Guinea or they can apply to go to the United States. As to all of this rhetoric that comes out of the Greens about going to New Zealand: they already know what will happen. That will re-open people coming on the high seas into this part of the world, and more men, women, and children—whose lives you do not and have not valued or ever recognised—will perish at sea again. More people will die.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got these people at Manus Island who've got choices. We've had the government of PNG declare publicly that there are other facilities to which they can go today. So they can move to these facilities. As to the standards and the care that they will receive, that, to date, has cost the Australian government $11 billion. That's $11,000 million to support these people. And here you would think that somehow we've left them with a fig leaf over their vital parts, that we won't feed them or water them and that we won't give them health and psychiatric support.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that has never been recognised is this: say I were a refugee or had determined myself to be a refugee, and I had fled my country and had come, via all sorts of routes, on the high seas, on boats that should have had 50 people on them but had 500 on them, and had gone through the immense trauma of that journey to this place, and had watched my brothers and sisters and mother and father and children die, nameless, with no ceremony, no grave and no place to rest. It does not surprise me that many of these people find themselves in a conflicted position. It does not surprise me that many of these people feel traumatised. And what has our government done? We have provided exceptional health and support services for these people—so much so that many Australians in need of health and psychiatric care do not get care of the same standard that these people get it and don't get it within the same time frame. And Senator McKim knows this. This is the problem. These facts are inconvenient. And that's why we hear him over here, bellowing like an old bull caught in a barbed wire fence. Seriously, Senator McKim—as to what you've tried to portray here, you've been a single voice. You don't have any support from your colleagues. They're all silent around this question.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  You can determine the health of a democracy by how it treats some of its most vulnerable people. Some of those vulnerable people were asylum seekers who travelled to Australia on leaky boats some many years ago and sought asylum. It is now some five years on and those asylum seekers, men, women, and children, on Manus Island and Nauru have been languishing and have been treated appallingly by this government. They have simply been left and forgotten. As a country, we cannot abdicate our responsibility for what occurs on Manus Island. But the other thing we should not be doing is creating politics out of this—and that is exactly what the government have been doing for so many years now. They have been creating fear politics with the Australian people. This, of course, has led to these asylum seekers not being able to be settled in Australia; in fact, not being able to be settled anywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These asylum seekers have indeed been forgotten by this government—so much so that the government has received incredible and ongoing criticism not just from civil society here in Australia, not just from the opposition and other parties, but also from the international community, and only as recently as a week or so ago, when the United Nations Human Rights Committee released its recommendations from its review of Australia's compliance with a key human rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—another breach of a treaty that we have signed up to, but there are so many more. One thing I learnt last year when I spent some time at the United Nations was that the one issue that we were absolutely pulled over the coals for as a nation, and rightly so, was how we were treating vulnerable people who sought asylum—how we were treating refugees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's obviously a very opportune week for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull because he's at the East Asia Summit. He has that opportunity again to engage with President Trump and also with Prime Minister Ardern. Both the US and the New Zealand governments have offered and agreed to settle these refugees who are desperately seeking settlement so that they can rebuild their lives and get over the trauma that they have suffered. We are still waiting, of course, for the some 1,250 that the US agreed to settle to actually be settled. There have only been about 50. But I understand from the briefings I've received that that processing is going as it should be and, hopefully, will happen sooner than later. The other offer on the table came over a year ago—probably 18 months ago now—from the former New Zealand government, but it has continued under the new New Zealand Labour government, to settle some 150 refugees a year who are on Manus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to Minister Dutton and I've written to Mr Turnbull. Labor has been constantly asking this government to act on these settlement options. But it's refusing to do so. What does that say about this government? It says that it is quite willing to leave 600 men on Manus Island, potentially in a situation where their lives are at stake and where they're fearing for their ongoing safety. It is absolutely abhorrent to me and to everyone in the Labor Party that a government would treat another human being in this way. We do have a sense of humanity and that is why we have been constantly asking this government to act, whether it's on the medical care that those on these offshore islands have required in Australia or whether it's on the New Zealand settlement arrangement. We have constantly been calling on this government to act.</span>

                  </a>  Senator McKim constantly comes into this place and gets out on the media streams, saying, 'Tell everyone the facts.' We know the facts. We know how bad the facts are. We don't need you to constantly tell us the facts. We have civil society out there telling us the facts. I've had umpteen briefings from the UNHCR. Amnesty International are at this moment waiting in my office to give me another briefing. We've had so many briefings. We know how bad it is, and we have made it so public that the government knows. What we need are solutions. We need solutions to this problem. So stop playing politics with the Labor Party, because you make yourselves just as bad as the government in doing so. We know you're the protest party. You're not a party of government. But you need to make a decision. What government do you want at the next election? Do you want a Labor government or do you want a coalition government? Every time you attack the progressive side of politics, you do yourself a disservice in the sense that you are assisting the coalition to win brownie points. That is not helping the people on Manus Island, nor the people on Nauru. Giving them false hope does not help.</span>

There is a two-party preferred system in this country, and at the next election either there will be a Labor government or there will be a coalition government. I know which one I'd prefer, and I certainly know which one the people in my Australian community—indeed, in my Tasmanian community—would prefer when it comes to the issue of refugees. If they want a protest vote, they can vote for the Greens.</span>

I will not have the Greens come into this place and pretend that they are holier than thou with their moral virtues, that they are somehow going to resolve this awful situation when they simply have no power to do so. Moving a motion in this place is not going to resolve that. No matter how many tweets, Facebook posts and media stunts you do they are not going to resolve that, so grow up! Grow up, and start to work out how to create good policy. The dark green taint of Senator McKim gives Senator Richard Di Natale absolutely no support whatsoever.

It's the government that is treating people so badly. It's the government that can change its policies. That's what we do! We actually address the fact that it's the government failing these people and that it's the government that needs to find solutions. Why don't you go to New Zealand and talk to new Labour Prime Minister Ardern about her offer and ensure that Malcolm Turnbull takes it up? No, you attack the Labor Party. That's the Greens. That's what happens when the Greens run out of ideas about how to continue to increase their vote numbers. Let's face it, we know their dishonest approach when it comes to this debate.</span>

As a doctor, I can only imagine what the health consequences of these actions will be.

These are traumatised people, many of whom are depressed and many of whom are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Their psychotropic medication has now been withdrawn. We know that the abrupt withdrawal of medication like that can precipitate suicide. We know that people will die. Anti-convulsant medication has been taken away from people with epilepsy. It is remarkable that here we are in 21st century Australia and we have a government that is prepared to inflict more cruelty and more trauma on innocent people who are suffering. These aren't just the words of the Greens or of refugee advocates. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have said this.

People have been told, 'You need to move out,' but we know from the UNHCR that the reported facilities that were supposed to be ready are not fit for human habitation. But that, of course, is not the major issue. The major issue is that we are asking people to come out of that detention centre and go into an environment where there are a number of people in the local community who simply don't want them there and who are prepared to use violence to resolve this conflict. The fear of these individuals is real.</span>

Senator McKim stands like a beacon in this place for being prepared to bear witness. It's remarkable that people in this place would accuse Senator McKim and others of inciting violence, as though these individuals have no agency and no capacity or, because these are people who are coming from another culture, somehow they're not capable of making their own decisions. It is remarkable. The time has come for us to accept, at the very least, New Zealand's offer of generosity to take those 150 people, and to ditch the deal with the US. For God's sake, let's show a bit of humanity and a bit of decency. Why can't we bring them here? Why can't we offer these people safety?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  What an inconvenient situation for the Greens political party that I just happened to be in Papua New Guinea last week. Some lawyers, no doubt egged on by Senator McKim—and the usual bunch of lawyers that we get at every Senate estimates committee—took proceedings within the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea. That court met just last Tuesday, the 7th. The claim by these people was that the closure was unconstitutional. They were seeking orders from the Supreme Court to restrain military personnel from taking over the naval base. They were claiming orders that food should be restored and electricity and water supplies should be restored. But, of course, that was opposed by the PNG government, who are the relevant government, on the basis that services were fully provided at the east Lorengau detention centre for refugees, at the west Lorengau detention centre for refugees and at the Hillside centre for non-refugees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it's not possible in this chamber for me to use props or to show this photograph, but let me describe the photograph from <span style="font-style:italic;">The National</span>, the newspaper of Papua New Guinea, which has a policeman pointing to the east Lorengau camp that has been set up. I can't show this, but might I say it looks like a 1980s motel in Australia. It's a long building. It looks to contain 50 or so rooms. It's hard walled with cement pylons, windows and air conditioning. It has panels on the roof for electricity. When the Supreme Court heard all of the evidence from reliable sources, it dismissed the claim, saying that there were alternative facilities available. All of the lies you hear from the Greens political party and GetUp! about this being a humanitarian crisis and that people are living in a hovel are completely unnecessary, because the PNG government has provided not one, not two, but three other facilities where there is water, there is food, there is every facility and there is air conditioning—and a lot better than many Australians have in their own home. I will seek later to table this newspaper cutting, which has a photograph of the east Lorengau centre that simply puts the lie to the Greens political party. You can see how they've all gone quiet, because someone has—</span>

                  </a>  We're told these people are in a jail. It's the sort of inflammatory language the Greens use. They sent along their GetUp! people to invade my office last Friday when I was in PNG at the time—they were too stupid to come when I was there—and they got themselves arrested because they intimidated my staff. But we expect those sorts of things from the Greens and GetUp!. If Senator McKim and Senator Singh want to know what's really happening, why go to UNHCR officials? Some of them are good; some of them you couldn't describe that way. Why not go to the honest, hardworking Australian public servants who know what is happening there?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the misfortune of chairing the estimates committee where immigration is brought up, and every time Senator McKim keeps asking the same questions and being told by Australian public servants what the situation is. The situation is that these people—who are not refugees, most of whom have been found not to be refugees; those who are refugees have been invited to apply to go to America or can settle within Papua New Guinea—are currently getting $174 a week in pay from the Australian taxpayer in addition to medical care and accommodation, which includes all of their food.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator McKim has been told time and time again, the people on Manus are free to move around the island and in the general community there. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier Mail</span> showed a wonderful photo of some of these so-called refugees being confined there, looking like they're on a holiday on a tropical island. They're allowed to do that. They live there freely. They can come and go as they please. Again, this is evidence in the Senate estimates committee. The service is much nicer at east Lorengau—I'm quoting an Australian official—than in the regional processing centre, which is where they were. All the accommodation being offered is hard walled. Each of the units in east Lorengau that people will be living in have a shared kitchen, a living facility, a number of bedrooms and a bathroom. They have a washing machine facility adjacent to the unit areas, as well as prayer rooms and other service areas where they can congregate and meet, and there are training facilities as well. Does this sound like a jail? Does this sound like the police and army in PNG are herding these people around and tipping over their only source of water? They only have to walk—they don't have to walk, they will be transported by the PNG officials—a couple of minutes away to three wonderful sites that are available and have all the food, all the medication, all the doctors, all the resources that are needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet Senator McKim would have Australians believe—and he fools some people. Some of these GetUp! numpties that run around protesting might be fooled by Senator McKim, but why don't they find out the real facts and not take the word of Senator McKim, who has a clear personal interest in this? I often wonder just how much the people smugglers donate to the Greens political party at election time, because every one of these illegal maritime arrivals was paying the people smugglers $15,000 per person. They're hardly poor people. That's in addition to the airfare to Indonesia. Senator McKim goes up there and gives these people false hope. He tells them that, if they protest enough, they might eventually get into Australia, but they will not get into Australia. They should know that. They have wonderful accommodation facilities, with food, water, clothing, electricity and air conditioning, just around the corner. But don't take my word for it; go and read the decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, which made findings of fact that there was no case for those people to stay there; there was nothing holding them there; there were other perfectly good facilities, with food, water, shelter and clothing, just around the corner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would help if some of the people there weren't alleged to have committed sexual offences on under-aged children there. That has upset some of the locals; I know that. But the majority of those there are not in that category and they are free to come and go. In fact, as someone said in the newspaper in PNG while unfortunately I just happened to be there last week, Senator McKim, these people have actually been moving from this site to these other sites for the last three years, walking back and forth quite safely with no threat to their lives or persons. All of the facilities are there and available.</span>

The evidence is clear from UN bodies, the AMA and Amnesty, and we've heard the contributions of Senators Nick McKim and Richard Di Natale—like Senator Di Natale's description of what is happening to the health of the 600 men forced into the most appalling situation, which is deeply shocking on its own, and Senator McKim's description of the deprivation with regard to the removal of water containers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How could it come to this? We know why it's come to this. The Liberals and the Nationals see this as a way to retain power. They have been cultivating fear of refugees in this country for so long. This is the ugly side of politics in the 21st century. That it has come to this is incredible. I've lived in this country all my life, but to see our government, whatever its persuasion, doing this is deeply shocking. Peter Dutton, the minister, is holding on to his seat by 1,505 votes. That is what is motivating him so deeply to cultivate this fear amongst people, hoping that's how he can cling on to power. How forceful he is in wanting to retain that tactic was shown in the way he handled the offer from the new Prime Minister of New Zealand, Prime Minister Ardern, which said very clearly that 150 of these people could go to New Zealand. Before the Australian Prime Minister had had the opportunity to discuss that offer with the New Zealand Prime Minister, he was already out there condemning and rejecting it, because he wants to hold on to this scare tactic that they're running.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why? Because we also know what the purpose of Manus is. The Prime Minister knows it, the former minister, Mr Morrison, knows it and Minister Dutton knows it—that is, they are using Manus Island as a deterrent by making the whole place so repulsive, so brutal. The degree of suffering, abuse and torture that the 600 men who have been there for many months have experienced is beyond belief. And that's the intent of this island—to make it so repulsive that the message will percolate out: 'Don't try and come to Australia; it's a ruthless regime, and this is what will happen to you.' So that's the situation with the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as to Labor: Labor do need to look at what they're doing. There is a pathway for them to change their position. The United Nations Human Rights Council has called for Manus to be closed immediately. The United Nations refugee council has talked about the unspeakable persecution going on there. And, despite what Senator Macdonald says, the PNG government has said, very clearly, that this is Australia's responsibility, as have all those people there—the AMA; Catholic Social Services; Amnesty. Labor, if they could find their backbone, would have the backing of so many. They can have a pathway to standing up and doing the right thing by Australian law and by international law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do congratulate the protesters who disrupted the Melbourne Cup, and those who got onto the Opera House and took over the immigration department. Direct action is now being taken up by more people. People are angry in Australia; they're deeply disturbed. I very much congratulate Senator Nick McKim for going to that island and getting evidence from those people and bringing it back here. The clear message now is: evacuate. Evacuate now. Bring these 600 people to safety. That's 600 people; other countries have millions of refugees. It's time we did the right thing, and it should start with these 600 men.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been an issue ever since I came into this place on, I think, 1 July 2011. I can remember Senator Cash being extremely vocal on this issue. It occurred to me at that time. Right at that point I thought: 'This is Australia. Why are we fighting over this issue? Our reputation as a taker of humanitarian refugees is without question.' Without question, we have taken more humanitarian refugees per capita than almost any other nation in the world. We've done it well, we've done it successfully and I think we did it in a bipartisan way. But the tragedy of this situation now is that we can't find our way through what looks like a pretty awful situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't like to turn on the TV and see people in distress anywhere, and we certainly don't like to see people who ostensibly are under the support, care and protection of the Australian government without electricity, water, medical facilities and the like. But I'm not sure that the political parties in this place at the moment—and I exempt the Labor Party from this, but I include the Greens party and the coalition—are really working in any way collegiately and cooperatively to a proper resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears as if our Prime Minister has unerringly bad judgement and, whenever there is a chance to make a decision, he will unfailingly make the wrong decision. There is evidence of that right throughout his prime ministership. If ever there was a case for a Prime Minister to grab an issue by the whatever you'd like to refer to and show some genuine leadership, this is it. There have been a succession of ministers in this space. I do not talk at first hand, but I've heard in our caucus previous ministers in this space who have been distressed. The immigration portfolio has been a life-changing experience. It has really changed the way they've thought about and looked at the whole of our activity in this space. So it is not an easy portfolio and we had many problems, but what has happened has become immensely political now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I get, like every senator in this place, the genuine concern. Australian constituents are making appointments, coming into my office and asking me to support positions which are contrary to my party policy and probably contrary to the fairly pragmatic position that I hold, but I understand the passion which they feel. They want these people to be in a better space, and it's a genuinely widely felt and deeply felt issue right throughout the Australian community. If ever there was one issue which we should be working together on, this is the type of issue where we should have no difference. Labor, Liberal, Green, Australian Conservatives—no-one should be allowed to get away with playing tawdry political games in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has an enviable reputation as a haven for people in humanitarian refugee intakes. I went to the town of Mount Gambier a couple of years ago, just after I became a senator. We had taken Karen refugees from the Burmese border. We had taken a chance, so to speak. We relocated them into regional South Australia, and in a very short space of time their children had taken over the schools. They were excellent in every area. The parents had got into viticulture and were all excelling at contributing to the economy. At their Australian citizenship ceremony, they sang the anthem in English, and all of them were working. We do this very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is this really hard economic line about people who are refugees. Let's face it: we know that the stats say that quite a large proportion of these people on Manus Island are refugees. If we're not going to let them in here, we should be resettling them somewhere else. We shouldn't be simply saying, 'The door's closed here; you can rot in New Guinea,' because I don't think I would like to live in New Guinea. I don't think I would like the opportunity to participate in the New Guinea economy, and I qualify all this by saying I have never been in New Guinea, but, from what I have seen of some of the problems that any country that's developing has, it's not a place where I would like to go and resettle. So you can understand that these people are not actually inspired to settle in New Guinea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I really do think that we ought to do this debate a bit of justice and rise above the petty pointscoring and politics. I respect Senator Rhiannon's contribution, but I don't really think that roughing people up at a fundraiser or becoming strident in your verbal and physical actions is going to bring a result that helps people. I think the division that has been shown in this last hour is the problem. Harder heads need to get together, sit down and work out a compromise solution which sees these people move to New Zealand or move to the United States or move to any other resettlement option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't disagree in some respects that the Hon. Peter Dutton would be the hardest of people in this space. Given that it's an extremely hard task, he has not shown any compassion, any mercy or anything other than, 'My way or the highway,' and, 'I am right on this.' Anyway, what it really looks like, and what I really have some discomfort with, is that he seems to think it's good politics. Well, if it is good politics and it gets him some votes, it's a disgraceful way to get votes by treading on people's humanity, by not affording them the generosity that was afforded to me, my family, Senator Dastyari's family and many hundreds of thousands, in fact millions, of Australians who came to this country, made a good life and were welcomed. If you want to play politics, this is the wrong issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  For two weeks now, over 600 asylum seekers and refugees have been holed up in the Manus Regional Processing Centre and have rightly refused to move to the new transit accommodation at Lorengau, which they fear very much is not secure. While these men endure squalid conditions, it is business as usual for this government. Drinking water, food, medical treatment, electricity and sewerage services have been cut off. The government has now made this PNG's problem, when it really very much should be ours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an international embarrassment. Worse, how can Australia diplomatically counsel other countries about their human rights obligations when we are clearly—very clearly—failing ours? Need we be reminded that in June the government settled a $70 million class action brought about by more than 1,900 men who were detained in hostile and damaging conditions? It seems that, once asylum seekers arrive by boat, this government forgets that they are human beings with needs and emotions, no different from any of us here. Many have suffered terrible events in their home country and continue to suffer in detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new transit accommodation has been hastily erected, and, according to the UNHCR, the West Lorengau transit facility was still incomplete by the time the men were due to move in on 31 October. This still appears to be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the fact that the local community doesn't want them there and these detainees are really Australia's responsibility, the government should consider New Zealand's genuine offer to resettle 150 asylum seekers. That is 150 men and women who finally get a chance to live a full and peaceful life. As for the government's argument that it will encourage asylum seekers to use New Zealand as a back door to Australia, well, that argument is very flimsy. Besides the fact that it insults New Zealand by implying that people our neighbour accepts would immediately seek to leave rather than stay there, I fail to see how this argument can be sustained. Firstly, New Zealand is only proposing to take 150 people. It's not an open-ended offer. Secondly, a similar argument can be made against the US deal, which the government was so happy to jump on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many asylum seekers spend too many years wallowing in immigration detention. The irony and the horror are that we are simply doing more damage to already traumatised people, and we offer them no hope. I add my voice to that of the UNHCR and many others urging the government to accept New Zealand's offer and, over and above that, to remember its humanity and expedite resettlement of all our offshore detainees.</span>

The Australia that I know and love is a welcoming place. It's a place where we value people from all over the world. In particular, it's a place where we have welcomed refugees with open arms for decades and decades. The Australians that I know have good hearts. The Australians that I know do not condone torture—and that's what we are doing to these innocent people. The UNHCR says indefinite detention is torture—let alone leaving men to die, which is what is going on in the Manus Island detention centre now. This is Australia's Guantanamo Bay. This is our Gitmo.</span>

The caring, thoughtful, welcoming people of Australia, who live in our diverse multicultural community, know that these people who we have locked up indefinitely, these people who have lost all hope, are our brothers, they are other people's brothers, they are people's husbands, they are people's children, they are people who love and live and just want a chance to be living a good life. They are people who have fled persecution from many different parts of the world—from Iran, from Iraq, from Burma. They are the Rohingyan refugees whom we in this place over the last month have been so concerned about and wanting to make sure that they could have a good life. That's who these people are. But because in their desperation to flee persecution they got on a boat to come to Australia we have turned our backs on them and said no. We've said: 'We don't see you as humans. We're just going to treat you as collateral damage. You are just the scapegoats. You are just going to be the example for the rest of the world to stop the boats.' And these men are dying to be that example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not the Australia that I want to be part of. These men deserve a life. We know that we haven't even stopped the boats by having them at Manus island. We are just turning the boats away and not talking about it. We know what needs to happen to stop the boats—and that is for the world, including Australia, to accept that there are millions of refugees in the world who need to be resettled and that we need to be having serious attempts to create peace in their countries. These people are going to need to have places to be resettled in. We need to be lifting our intake of refugees in Australia, not turning people away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />We've got a chance to reshape what's going on now and actually say, 'Enough is enough. These people deserve to come to Australia. They can be Australians. They will fit in as Australians like refugees before them have done.' We have 400 people fleeing persecution. We have people there who can't be resettled in PNG because of its anti-homosexuality legislation. They would continue to be persecuted if they were to live in PNG. We should be welcoming these people as our fellow Australians and showing Australia to be the humanitarian, caring, welcoming country that we once were. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cybersecurity is a strategic priority for the Australian Government. In 2013, the Australian Government set 30 June 2014 as the target date for entities to achieve compliance with the Top Four mitigation strategies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Top Four strategies represent the minimum cybersecurity requirement for Government entities, and according to the Australian Signals Directorate will stop 85% of cyber intrusions if implemented. The Committee is deeply concerned with the 2015-16 result whereby only 65% of non-corporate Commonwealth entities reported compliance.</span>

This is most concerning to the Committee as previous assurances had been made that compliance would be achieved during 2016. During the inquiry, the Committee also heard that the Immigration department was unable to provide a date for when full compliance with all Top Four strategies would be achieved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee also draws attention to the issue of the ATO and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection inaccurately self-assessing their compliance.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee has recommended that both agencies report back on their progress to achieving full compliance with the mandatory cybersecurity strategies, as well as progress implementing the two Auditor-General recommendations. The Committee is also of the opinion that the self-assessment and reporting regime under the Government's framework requires further scrutiny, and recommended that the Auditor-General consider conducting a comprehensive audit to assess the regime's effectiveness.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This year the Australian Signals Directorate updated its cybersecurity strategies from the Top Four to the Essential Eight in response to the increasing threat of ransomware—such as the recent WannaCry virus. The Signals Directorate considers the Essential Eight as a cybersecurity 'baseline' for all organisations. In this light, the Committee recommended that the Government mandate the Essential Eight strategies for all Commonwealth entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee also wishes to highlight that secure internet gateways add a valuable later of cybersecurity. Acknowledging that Internet Gateways are complementary to other cybersecurity resilience, they too provide a sound baseline of protection within an entity's broader cyber resilience strategy. As such, the Committee has also recommended that the Internet Gateway Reduction Program is made mandatory for all Commonwealth entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a strategic priority, it is crucial that Commonwealth entities are accountable to the Australian Parliament for their management of cybersecurity. The Inquiry found a number of key gaps in this area. To enhance accountability and transparency, the Committee has recommended:</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Signals Directorate report annually on the Commonwealth's cybersecurity posture to the Parliament; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that the Australian Government make the annual Australian Signals Directorate cybersecurity posture survey mandatory for all Commonwealth entities. The Committee is concerned that as ASD is currently unable to compel entities to complete the survey, the poor response rates of 30-40 per cent in 2016 and 2017 will be repeated in future years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recognises that cyber resilience is not solely ascertained through compliance with the Top Four or the Essential Eight strategies or the implementation of a secure internet gateway. The Committee stresses that good governance and a strong culture of prioritising cybersecurity within the context of entity-wide strategic objectives are essential elements to an entity achieving the goal of cyber resilience.</span>

This can include home modifications, personal care and domestic assistance in the home that helps a participant with activities of daily living such as dressing and showering, as well as cooking and cleaning in the home.

As such, the NDIS introduced SDA supports from 1 July 2016. SDA is housing that enables people with very high needs to receive the support they need. SDA support will provide funding towards the cost of the physical environment for eligible NDIS participants to live and receive their daily supports. SDA may include special designs for people with very high needs or may have a location or features that make it feasible to provide complex or costly supports for independent living.</span>

In addition to this funding (included in their plan), NDIS participants will be expected to make a reasonable rent contribution to their SDA provider which is no more than 25 per cent of Disability Support Pension (DSP) and other supplements, and 100 per cent of Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA), if applicable. This rental payment is comparable to social housing rents and provides an affordability safeguard for participants. NDIS participants are also able to pay a higher rental contribution if they wish, in order to access higher cost accommodation, similar to the experience for private renters. Additionally, for NDIS SDA participants who are financially able, the SDA payment can be utilised in owner-occupier situations. </span>

                        <span class="HPS-TableLeftAlignSmall">In 2011, the Productivity Commission recommended that as part of the SDA payment, the NDIS should separate accommodation costs from support costs that high-needs individuals have greater ability to choose their accommodation and separately choose their care supports. The SDA policy does this by separating support and accommodation providers and giving participants greater visibility over the cost of their supports and enabling them to make informed decisions. Additionally, it is a requirement under the NDIS that board payments (such as food or utilities) are separated from the accommodation support, again giving participants greater visibility over what they are paying.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I wish to speak to the government response to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme report <span style="font-style:italic;">Accommodation for people with disabilities and the NDIS</span>. I move:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the document.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report arose from the joint standing committee's review of affordable and appropriate accommodation for people living with disability. This followed an earlier report which noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the lack of adequate accommodation can limit people’s ability to fully exercise their individual choice and control. It can also limit people’s ability to fully participate in society and live an ordinary life like any other Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that Australians with disability cannot be assured at present that there is housing suitable for them. It is also clear that one size does not fit all. Australians with disability are not all the same. They differ in needs and preferences, like every other member of our community. This is a key factor which must be recognised and accepted if we are to make real progress in providing housing for people with disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In undertaking the review, the committee received 55 submissions and conducted a roundtable meeting on 23 October 2015. The committee made six very important recommendations to address the issue. I would like to cover each of them, briefly, and the government's response in the time that I have available. In the government's response that we've just had tabled the government has agreed with five of the recommendations and noted one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first recommendation is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that Commonwealth and state and territory governments work with national disability peak organisations and the Australian Building Codes Board to examine updating the Building Code of Australia in regard to accessibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This task remains unfinished. In the work that the Senate Community Affairs Committee has been doing in looking at the National Disability Strategy, we have heard considerable evidence to suggest that we need to not only ensure that the Building Code is updated, but that steps are taken to ensure that accessibility becomes a shared goal for all those involved in building houses—that is, builders, architects and homeowners. Accessibility shouldn't be an add-on or a nice thing to have. It should be a given, and we have some way to go before we get there. There is some interesting innovation happening, but in my view we still have some way to go to ensure that accessibility is a normal part of the scoping, designing, building and finishing process. And government does have a vital role to play in making sure everyone involved in the building process recognises this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, in its response, has advised that the Building Ministers' Forum has:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… agreed to propose to COAG that a national Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) be undertaken as soon as possible to consider applying a minimum accessibility standard for private dwellings …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that's good. However, with that work being undertaken and the discussions that have been had over many years, we know that if the RIA goes ahead, it will still be at least 2022 before it is implemented. So we do have a long way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second recommendation that the committee made was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that accommodation for people with disability be integral in the development of affordable and social housing policy proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report noted that the NDIS is not the fix-all solution for accommodation for people with disability. The NDIS will not provide housing solutions for all people with disabilities. While some housing needs will be addressed, there is a need to build housing for people with disability in all affordable and social housing policy proposals. There is a need to integrate these so that housing for people with disabilities is not seen as separate to affordable and social housing projects, but as an integral part of all proposals. Just today, I read reports that the Tenants' Union in my home state of Tasmania is calling for residential buildings on previously public land to incorporate a mandatory component of social and affordable housing. My belief is this call should also include the provision of accessible accommodation for people with disability. As a community, we are getting our minds around this but we need to go further and we need to go further soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the government has agreed with the recommendation but does little, in my view, to explain what it is actually going to do. It does talk about the new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. Senators in this place will know that that agreement has not been released and, as far as I'm aware, hasn't even been signed off. I think the government really does need to do more in its response to recommendation 2 and needs to come back and provide more information in regard to recommendation 2 because it's vitally important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now move to recommendation 3. The committee recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Commonwealth government explore all possible proposals for disability accommodation, and the ways it can assist in bringing them to fruition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that getting housing proposals off the ground can take a long time. When it's a proposal that includes housing for people with disabilities, it can be even harder. So, talking here today, I'd like to mention the tireless work of my Tasmanian colleague Bob Gordon, who has been pursuing cost-effective solutions for affordable housing that would help maximise independence and choice. Despite all the frustration Bob has faced in this work, he has kept plugging away, and he should be congratulated on that. The Commonwealth needs to take an active role to get this done, and it must work with the whole community to promote the value of a truly inclusive and accessible community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we turn to recommendation 4, which was for an analysis of proposals that the Commonwealth should assess about how financially accessible they are for people with disability and their families. Again I have to say that, whilst I'm happy the government has agreed with this recommendation, I think the information that's been provided by the government does fall quite short and it would be good, again, for them to supplement their response. Obviously, a key part of determining just how practical housing proposals for people with disability are is the affordability of the accommodation for people with disabilities. We need to work as a community to ensure that the best type of accommodation, which maximises choice and control, is actually affordable for the people it is designed for. People with disability already face enormous challenges without paying a premium for accommodation. We need to make sure that suitable housing is affordable and no more expensive than other housing. This is a task that we all need to work towards and to complete.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't got enough time to go through the other recommendations, so I hope that further speakers will keep this response on the Senate books, but I would like to say that, if people haven't read this report, I ask them to go and have a look at it and then compare it with the government response. As I've said, the government has accepted five out of the six recommendations, but we do need to make sure that the needs of people living with disabilities are at the forefront, and so we must be— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I would be happy to continue with the report from the point at which Senator Brown has left off, given the time limits that she had, and I will make sure that I seek leave to continue my remarks at the end. Just so those listening to the broadcast, and the sole individual who is here representing the Australian people at the moment and watching the work of the Senate, understand what we're talking about, this report that was tabled has been with the government, and we have the response from the government right now. The scale of the problem that we're talking about is people with a disability who have a need for accommodation assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data that informed this report to which the government's response is tabled today is from the 2011 report <span style="font-style:italic;">Disability care and support</span>. The calculations then were that there were 15,700 people in state government managed supported accommodation and a further 6,500 in residential aged care. The estimated waiting lists at that time indicated that there might be 25 per cent more of the population who needed specialist disability accommodation. It went on to say that, with population increases, the Productivity Commission working figure was now around 28,000 people, or 6.8 per cent of the projected participants who might require direct assistance under the scheme. The NDIA estimates that up to 193,000 participants are on low to very low incomes and may need housing assistance from some source, including those with assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of people that we're talking about that need to be considered in the way in which the government has chosen to respond. The groups that were identified were 6,200 people under 65 in residential aged care, 17,000 people in specialist disability accommodation—3,000 of those in institutions and 14,000 in group homes—and 57,000 people living in social and public housing. At the commencement of this process, the estimated unmet need for affordable housing is roughly 127,000 NDIS participants. That's a lot of people. People with a disability are overrepresented in housing assistance programs and are reporting on many occasions multiple barriers to accessing suitable housing, including barriers in the housing system itself, as well as barriers with the disability support system. The government's response really matters. It matters to at least those 127,000 people, plus all of their families, friends and co-workers who want to know that people with disability are being looked after in this wealthy, generous nation that we are.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brown indicated in her remarks the government's responses to the report. Let's look at them. The first recommendation is that the:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have agreed with that. But, as Senator Brown pointed out in her remarks, they're pretty light on detail. So, if you're one of those 127,000 people or one of them is somebody you love and care about or somebody you look after in your community, I wouldn't be holding out too much hope for what the government have agreed to here. We're seeing a lot of comments that, to me, indicate a general waving at the problem but no detailed policy work, no careful planning and no allocation of required funding to make this happen. In fact, there are some very concerning lines I'll hopefully get to in the time I have remaining.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that Senator Brown left off in her remarks discussing recommendation No. 3, which is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends the Commonwealth government explore all possible proposals for disability accommodation, and the ways it can assist in bringing them to fruition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you, I have heard this too many times from this Commonwealth government. Just remember that when John Howard came into power we started paying our taxes through the BAS forms. They are being filled in by businesses across this country to this day. Every three months, their tax comes to Canberra. There is a responsibility for us to make sure that the money that's required for basic services gets back into the communities where it's needed. The problem we're seeing with this government is that it's getting the money but abrogating the responsibility. I get very concerned when I hear this government saying things like, 'This problem'—the provision of affordable housing—'is the responsibility of the individual state and territory governments.' It refers us in point 3, where the government agrees with the report, to point 2. But in point 2 I really couldn't see any significant commitment that is going to go anywhere near addressing the needs of the 127,000 people who are identified as people with disability who have a significant housing need.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the suggestions in the government's response make me even more concerned. One says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">NDIS participants will receive individualised planning to identify the supports needed to enable their goals to be met.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, that's the case. We know that. But what is the government doing about creating accommodation for people with disabilities? This response from the government is strewn with these sorts of general comments about what is going on in the NDIS space but absolutely not sufficient detail to give anyone confidence that it's actually prepared to deal with this significant problem, this significant reality, that is impacting on the lives of, I'd say, by association, millions of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, instead of this government coming up with a scale to indicate what affordability factors need to be considered and what the reality is—instead of something detailed and careful like that—the opening comment of the response to that recommendation is:</span>

The reality is that this is an attitude that we see on every single issue from this federal government. I see my esteemed colleague Senator Patrick Dodson here. He made amazing remarks today—wise words—on the departure of Jacqui Lambie. On so many occasions he speaks about issues around Indigenous needs in communities that are being ignored. This is another one of those social needs that is profound and important for our community: the need to have a proper response from this government.</span>

The most marginalised people in our community are suffering, and the government continues to put out platitudinous responses to serious work done by people right across this country. This report didn't happen because a few people here in this building sat down and decided they'd write up a few ideas. This committee has consulted across the country. This committee got the best and brightest minds of this country to put together a set of recommendations. The least the government could do is take the report seriously and come up with something genuine that is going to address the needs of the 127,000 people I mentioned in my opening remarks.</span>

Sadly, this government's response is not going to go anywhere near that. It lacks vision and it's chaotic and dysfunctional, just like the government that responded to the report.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to building a stronger, more prosperous and resilient economy where Australian businesses can be competitive on a domestic and international level. With this in mind, the Government is focussed on reducing the cost of doing business with the Commonwealth by reducing red tape, improving the operating environment, and enhancing government engagement with business, including small business, to build capability. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports a Commonwealth Procurement Framework that requires non-discrimination, allowing all suppliers, regardless of origin, to compete on their merits. This opens up comparable access to overseas markets for Australian businesses. This is further demonstrated by the Government's ongoing support of the Australian Industry Participation (AIP) National Framework, which encourages a national approach to maximise Australian industry participation in projects both domestically and internationally. Any recommendation to preference local suppliers must be carefully considered against Australia's international trade obligations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are a number of Government entities advocating in the interests of Australian businesses, including the Australian Industry Participation Authority, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and the Centre for Defence Industry Capability. These entities are focused on supporting industry growth, facilitating innovation and supporting Australian businesses in building their own capacity to succeed in their own right. These entities will continue to work with businesses to enable them to be well equipped to participate within the Government procurement market.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to progressing programs aimed at reducing the burden on Australian businesses. For example, the Government is working with Industry Capability Network (ICN) Limited to transition the existing ICN Gateway, a supplier matching service for major public and private projects, to a new platform and enhance its service to businesses. As part of its National Innovation and Science Agenda, the Government is transforming the way it buys digital and technology services, focusing on making it easier for small and medium businesses to compete for Government ICT projects. </span>

These initiatives focus on researching emerging and future technologies, and supporting Australian industry to commercialise such technology, which can deliver new and innovating capability for both Government and business. This grows capability and can lead to opportunities for export.</span>

The Government also supports maintenance of appropriate records when undertaking a procurement, including reasons for the selection of preferred tenderers. </span>

In light of the committee's recommendation to expand the use of Clause 10 of the Commonwealth Contracting Suite, a 'clause bank' of standard terms and conditions will be established for use by procuring entities in all Commonwealth contracts where appropriate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report is titled, quite cleverly I thought, <span style="font-style:italic;">Buying into our future: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview of amendments to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules</span>, and it was presented in August. I spoke on the report at that time. The Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, has now sent me, as deputy chair of the committee, the government's response to the report, and I thank him for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee held its hearings on this subject and prepared a report under the leadership of its then chair, former senator Nick Xenophon. As we know, Mr Xenophon has resigned from the Senate in order to return to South Australian politics. Although perhaps on this side of the chamber we may have had some differences in political outlook from Mr Xenophon, I do want to thank him for his enthusiastic chairing of this committee during the conduct of this inquiry and, in a wider sense, for his contribution to the Senate during the nine years he served here. I do wish him well, and maybe only a moderate amount of success in contesting the upcoming South Australian election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The subject of this inquiry is a very serious one. As I noted in August speaking on the report, Commonwealth agencies and departments enter into more than 70,000 contracts every year, with a value that exceeded $57 billion in 2015-16. This direct expenditure is in addition to the funding provided by the Commonwealth to state and territory governments, who procure goods and services on its behalf predominantly in the form of infrastructure spending. Of this $57 billion, Defence is the largest single procurer, but it's quite a forward-looking and forward-thinking procurer. I want to raise one issue—and I note the Minister for Indigenous Affairs is in the chamber. Defence has significantly exceeded its portfolio target for contracts awarded to Indigenous suppliers by awarding 285 contracts totalling $141 million. Due to the Commonwealth's successful implementation of the Indigenous Procurement Policy portfolio targets, these have been brought forward from financial year 2019-20 to financial year 2016-17. So they have come forward quite significantly. For Defence, this equates to a revised portfolio target for this financial year of 420 contracts, and Defence is on track to achieve this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To further support this, Defence is undertaking initiatives to enhance awareness of the Indigenous Procurement Policy requirements and is identifying opportunities where Indigenous businesses could be engaged and is working with Indigenous businesses to raise awareness of Defence procurement opportunities. The $57 billion and how this money is spent and where it is spent is obviously of great importance to the Australian economy, to Australian business and to Australian workers. We did have a large number of submissions from business, from unions and from economists, so it was actually quite a well fleshed out committee process and submission process. We were lucky that quite a lot of those submitters were able to give evidence as well to the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever free market economists may say, government spending is an important engine of the modern mixed economy, and government procurement is a key driver of economic growth and a supporter of employment, as we can see in the Indigenous Procurement Policy. That spending has a multiplier effect that boosts growth and employment throughout the economy. There are many industries that benefit greatly from government spending and government procurement. These include, as a simple example, vehicles—commercial, private and military. It also includes healthcare services, management, business and administrative services, building construction and maintenance services, and engineering, research and technology based services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an interesting range of submissions from the Australian Workers' Union, which included the benefits of a local procurement policy for steel, for example. Obviously when the AWU are not busy dealing with the media on their front doorstep because they're being raided, they're actually quite a busy union trying to contribute to the thought leadership that goes on about procurement. These submissions are available on the committee's website, but they include, for example, the report <span style="font-style:italic;">State of steel</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>a report into the future of the Victorian steel industry, the impact on government procurement and the regional economic impacts of the closure of BlueScope Steel operations in Port Kembla, for example. Obviously local steel procurement in government construction projects is quite a large expenditure in itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think government spending can be seen solely as a way of putting money into the economy. The money that government spends is taxpayers' money, and the government must ensure it gets value for the taxpayers. Nor can government procurement be used as a form of economic protectionism. Australia, as a member of the WTO, the World Trade Organization, has international obligations. Government purchasing must be conducted through a process of open and transparent tendering and not through opaque deals with favoured suppliers. The committee heard quite a lot of evidence about open tenders and limited tenders. I think how the government conducts purchasing and procurement in way that is open is now common ground among all political parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This does not mean, however, there is nothing Australian governments can do to see that government procurement has beneficial effects for the Australian economy and for Australian jobs. Work in negotiations with the government secured the inclusion of new, economic benefits criteria in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. Senator Xenophon, as he was then, was quite assiduous in ensuring that the Commonwealth Procurement Rules were amended in this regard. This is a welcome step, but the implementation by the Public Service will be critical to maximising Australian jobs. In this context it is important that the Commonwealth be a leader and have robust procurement processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint inquiry covered a number of important issues, including safeguarding standards of safety, human rights and ethics, sustainability and environment, consistency and transparency and how to effectively evaluate economic benefit. For example, just on one of those issues, we heard about the importation of certain materials where some economies or jurisdictions allow very questionable work practices, whether they be the employment of children or of indentured servitude, really. We had a number of submissions in that regard. I think it's critical that there be a consistent, transparent and effective application of the new rules, and it's not clear whether the government's response will ensure this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report made 16 recommendations. They made up a three-pronged approach which aimed to address the implementation issues identified and to ensure a consistent, transparent, and effective application of the new rules. This approach would involve the publication of comprehensive implementation guidelines which would explicitly address hitherto ambiguous terminology, such as the practical definition of the term 'economic benefit'. It became obvious during the hearings that economic benefit had different meanings for different people. The definition of a threshold for a business to be considered Australian would also need to be considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 16 recommendations, the government has supported only one—that is, that the procurement guidelines specifically require that, for all procurements over $4 million, a record be created including the reason for the tender approach chosen, the reason for the selection of the preferred tenderer and details of what economic benefit derives from the chosen tender. Another four recommendations are supported by the government in principle, and all of these, I have to say, deal with fairly minor matters, such as the training of the Public Service and developing a process for allowing the consideration of supplier feedback to the tender process. Another recommendation is supported in part, and this deals with the economic benefit criteria in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. The government response notes that, for procurements of over $20 million, Australian industry participation plans are already required by successful tenderers. There are two recommendations simply noted—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to address the government's response to the Economics References Committee's report on cooperative, mutual and member-owned firms, which was handed down in March of last year. It's always good to reflect on the fact that from time to time we in this place actually do some very worthwhile things, despite everything that you read in the media, and the Senate Economics References Committee's bipartisan report into cooperative, mutual and member-owned firms is an example of that. I was fortunate to take over as chair of the committee from Senator Dastyari during that inquiry. I acknowledge the very fine contributions that were made by Senator McKenzie and former Senator Xenophon during the inquiry. It was a very useful inquiry because it certainly opened my eyes to the contribution that is made to our economy by cooperatives and mutuals—it is very much underrated and not well known. I will talk about that a bit later on. As a result, I have become very passionate about the role that mutuals and co-ops can play in our society. I want to acknowledge my friend the shadow minister for charities and not-for-profits, Dr Leigh, in the other place, who has also been a strong advocate for this sector and I thank him for his support in bringing about Labor's commitments in this area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the significance of this committee, I note that the industry organisation representing the sector, the Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals, recently issued a report from National Mutual Economy and it talked about the enormous contribution that co-ops and mutual enterprises make to the national economy. Many people would be surprised to know that this sector contributes more to our economy than individually do the construction sector, the mining sector, the manufacturing sector or agriculture. In fact, this sector constitutes 8.3 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. Despite the fact that these cooperatives and mutual enterprises, or CMEs as they are referred to, are so significant, the sector remains relatively unknown and misunderstood. I can vouch for that in my own case. I was unaware, as I say, of the significance of the sector. It's interesting to note that, whilst 85 per cent of Australian adults are members of at least one cooperative or mutual enterprise, a poll found that only 12 per cent of adult Australians know that they are a member of a cooperative or a mutual. In my own case, I realised on reflection that I was a member of three such organisations—RACQ, Members Equity Bank, or ME Bank, and Australian Unity health insurance. I'm sure a lot of Australians have a vested interest in this sector and that's why the government's response to the report of this committee is so important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the sector has welcomed, by and large, the government's response to the report and, in particular, the government's moves to facilitate greater access to capital for mutuals and cooperatives and clearly define co-ops and mutuals in the Corporations Act. Both of these issues were addressed in the inquiry report of Mr Hammond OAM, who was given that job by the Treasurer following Labor's lead in adopting the recommendations of the Hammond review. The Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals, as I said, has welcomed these developments. The Customer Owned Banking Association, or COBA, have also welcomed these developments. It is important to note that customer-owned banks have a role to play in providing competition in the banking sector. Particularly when the major banks are driven very much by maximising profits and returns to shareholders, we see a lot of cultural issues and misbehaviour. I think it's really important that we have a competitive industry where customer-owned banks, with their unique profit-for-members approach, provide decent competition to the major banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently—in fact, last week—I was fortunate to be invited to a Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals summit in Brisbane and attend their conference dinner. It was pleasing to note that a number of speakers at the dinner, including the retiring chair of Credit Union Australia, Mr Alan Beanland, noted that the work of the Senate Economics References Committee was, in fact, a game changer for the sector in bringing the recognition that was needed in order to get these changes happening. It was, again, very pleasing to see the work of the Senate being held in high regard, in stark contrast to much of what you read about in the media from day to day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to indicate my overall support for trying to implement these recommendations in a bipartisan fashion. Cooperatives and mutuals shouldn't be a partisan issue. There are many sectors of our economy—for example, agriculture—which have significant cooperatives, so it is good to see bipartisan support in these areas. But I do want to draw attention to a couple of items in the government response. Firstly, recommendation 3 of our report was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends the Commonwealth Government work with states and territories to develop a program of supports to encourage the establishment of new co-operatives and mutual enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to place on the record my personal disappointment that this was the one recommendation that the government did not agree with. In my view—and I think it is generally a bipartisan view—cooperatives and mutuals are not on a level playing field in many ways. States and territories, as well as the federal government, undertake substantial work in promoting new businesses from time to time, especially small businesses. I don't think we should be shy or reticent about promoting new cooperatives and mutuals, because of the benefits that they bring, particularly in relation to their governance structures. It makes sense that federal, state and territory governments should be working together to make sure that potential new mutuals and co-ops don't face higher barriers than any start-ups for other type of enterprise and that they can access the same type of support. I'm sure that there is more work that can be done in getting cooperation in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to quickly talk about recommendation 10, which was:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes back to my comment that we'd like to see member-owned firms and cooperatives being on the same or equal footing as corporations when it comes to accessing government grants. The clearest example is in relation to the Indigenous Engagement Strategy, which does not allow non-corporations to apply for grants above a certain threshold without special exemptions. Cooperatives are a way for Indigenous collectives to further the goal of self-determination. I note that this is a recommendation that the government noted, so it would be very good to see some further work going on in this respect.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, I think it's fair to say that we do welcome the government's response to this inquiry. It's worth noting that the government has followed Labor's lead in this regard. I'm proud of the fact that it was Dr Andrew Leigh from the other place who late last year announced Labor's inclusive-ownership inclusive-growth package, which promotes ethical competition and productivity—measures which, back then, we were encouraging through the amendment of the Corporations Act to define mutual enterprises, to implement reforms and to facilitate new financial instruments for member-owned firms. One of the great impediments to cooperatives and mutuals is that they don't have a recognised capital-raising instrument, so this is a really important area of work to be done so we can enable cooperatives and mutuals to grow into the future without going down the track of demutualising. It is a great shame when we see that sort of thing happening. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, I know that I probably don't do your promotional prospects much good as I continue to remark on the great work that you have done in chairing our beloved Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into white spot. I want to put some things on the record about the committee's inquiry and its report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity risks associated with the importation of seafood and seafood</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> products</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> (including uncooked prawns and uncooked prawn meat) into Australia</span>. Firstly, I mention the aquaculture community, particularly in my home state of Queensland, which was so affected by this. From memory, there were nine growers or nine farms affected. There is simply no question that the negative economic impacts and the stress visited on their lives as a result of this outbreak of the white spot disease or virus will take many years for them to work through. They are a very resilient community and they worked diligently and patiently with government, both at a state and a federal level, until we were able to bring about something of a compensation package to support them financially, not only to deal with the impacts of the outbreak but also to ensure, to the best of our ability, that their businesses remained viable until they were able go back into production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just for the record, briefly what happened was that there was an outbreak of a virus that got into the wild. There were any number of pathways, but, unfortunately, and I might say embarrassingly for our government, one of the potential pathways resulted from failures in our biosecurity system. I need to be careful because at least in one case there are people before the courts and I think there are another four briefs pending with the Director of Public Prosecutions. I'll be very careful in my language, but the assertion is that there was behaviour on the part of some import traders, which, coupled with a failure on the part of some of our biosecurity people at the coalface, created an environment where, over a long period of time, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of infected prawn—and I doubt the volume will ever be well known—made their way into the retail chains around our country. The prawns were being sold in retail outlets for human consumption and, it was clear from the evidence that the inquiry took, there were recreational fishermen—and I don't blame them for this—who bought the prawns and used them as bait. Whilst we'll probably never know what the established pathway of the infection in the Logan River was, it was felt, certainly by the people affected, that recreational fishermen using retail prawns was probably the pathway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is some good news around the story, and I would like to say, without trying to embarrass him, that Senator Sterle drove a very probative inquiry, supported by colleagues from this side and indeed others, as we went in search of the truth around these biosecurity vulnerabilities that I've identified. Consequently, I think it is fair to say that, by the time the report was published, the department of agriculture had well and truly gone down the pathway of reviewing their practices and procedures and putting in place new architecture, you might say, that would minimise this happening in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it disrupted the supply chain. It disrupted trade. There were implications for imports of prawns that are still playing out. I think we're in strained relations with a couple of nations who haven't been happy about the increase in the testing regime that's been implemented. The test is now a more sensitive test than in the international standards—it is world's best practice—and I think it's fair to say that, as long as everybody does their job, and as long as importers act in good faith, we may well have at least mitigated the risk that might come from imports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't intend to take all of my time. I want to congratulate the chair of the references committee, Senator Sterle, and his colleagues and my own colleagues. It was a very collegial inquiry. We were very well received and there was a high level of confidence that this wasn't going to be just some sort of a brush-over on the part of a federal government references committee. We really did establish good faith, I think, with most people in the industry. So congratulations, Senator Sterle and others. I just wanted to have the opportunity to speak on this, given all the work and effort that had been put into it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I, too, want to make some brief comments, but I will be seeking leave to continue my remarks later because I believe there is a lot more that needs to be said. I just want to thank my colleagues on the inquiry. As to my deputy chair: there is a bit of a bromance going here; we are the odd couple—there is no doubt about that, for those listening! I'll just return the compliment to Senator O'Sullivan: there go your promotional prospects, too; they're down in the S-bend with mine!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, apart from that, one thing about the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, whether it be the legislative committee or the references committee, is: we have carried this for the 12 years I have been on this committee. This is a committee that prides itself on leaving all the BS politics out of it and getting stuck into doing what is best for rural and regional Australia and our food producers, and I will continue, as long as I am on that committee, to enhance that style. And, if anyone has got a problem with that, they can come and tell me—and I'll move to another committee, if I'm ganged up on. But I tell you what: it'll be a big push.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to say another thing, before I go to my colleague Senator Moore, who has got some really important stuff that she wants to touch on. I've sat through Senate estimates for years on end, and a previous chair of the committee, whether it be references or legislation, and a very dear friend—I'll say that; here's another odd couple—is former Senator Heffernan. One thing about the Heff is: no-one could ever, ever accuse him of not putting the interests of rural and regional Australia first. Former Senator Heffernan came into Senate estimates one day and he had a little parcel in his hand. He'd been banging on for years about the problem that we could have with an infestation of white spot virus in prawns. He pulled out, much to the shock of everyone in the room, a bag of prawns and dumped them on the desk. They were marinated prawns, clearly from South-East Asia. And he said, 'I don't know how many times I have to say this: what is stopping recreational fishers walking in and buying this cheaper product'—from Thailand, at the time—'washing off the marinade and using it for bait, dropping it in our rivers or oceans and infesting either our farmed prawn industry or the wild catch? God help us if that happens.' And you know what? Everyone treated former Senator Heffernan as the old uncle you had to have at the wedding but no-one wanted to sit on the same table with—it was disgraceful, actually, from the bureaucracy down. The ones we charged with our biosecurity treated him as a joke. And, sadly, about six or seven years later, unfortunately, there it was. And, to touch on Senator O'Sullivan's comments, it managed to wipe out an industry. We visited those people in the Logan area, and nothing hurts more than to see decent, hardworking people who are employing people and providing services being put out of business through no fault of their own.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought it was really important to take note this afternoon of the government response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report on the availability of new, innovative and specialist cancer drugs in Australia. As we all know, this is a particularly important issue for so many people in our community. But one of the reasons I wanted to take note this afternoon is to actually celebrate the fact that we do have a government response, dated November 2017, to a Senate community affairs report which was tabled in this place in September 2015. I think that it should be noted that, after two years and a bit, we have this government response. I do want to take the opportunity to say it is a detailed response to the Community Affairs References Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are many people out in their community who have been waiting to see this response. I acknowledge we have received it. I would hope we'll have the opportunity many times to talk about what's in it, because over 200 people and companies took the opportunity 2½ years ago to put submissions to this inquiry because they felt that this was such an important topic. They felt that it was really critical to the process that we have now in Australia—at the time in 2015—to put things on record about where policy should be driven and about the important elements that should be taking place in the development of policy and the response by our government to the issues of cancer research and, in particular, the challenges around the development, innovation and variation of drug treatments and how we, as a community, can access them. So, for the more than 200 people who submitted, yes, we now have a response from government. I think it will be a valuable place to take the debate into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the elements of working in this place is you get a real sense of the issues that are important to the community. This particular inquiry followed on from a number of previous inquiries in this place looking at the issues around cancer. Very soon after I came into the Senate, I had the privilege of being involved in a wide inquiry from the Community Affairs Committee. It was stimulated by then Senator Peter Cook, who, whilst very ill himself, actually led the Senate to look at ways that cancer was being treated in Australia and the challenges to people and practitioners who are working in this space. That still remains, I think, an incredibly important Community Affairs References Committee report. It is a baseline for what's come on subsequently during the time that I've been in this place, where we've had subsequent inquiries looking at issues around women's cancers and also looking at drug therapies. All of this builds our knowledge and also builds an understanding in the community that this place, the Senate, really does listen to the wider community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This afternoon, I want to pick up on the three recommendations that this committee made back in 2015, to which the government has now responded. It has set the stage. Quite a lot of activity was put into establishing where cancer fits in the Australian community. The fact—and it's noted in the government response—is it was estimated that over 45,780 people would die from cancer in 2015. That is an average of 125 deaths a day. That is the burden of this disease across our community. It says that forms of cancer comprise approximately 60 per cent of all expected diagnosed cancers. The leading ones identified with data were prostate, colorectal, breast, melanoma of the skin and lung. The report went into a great deal of data processes in the report, talking about exactly where cancer impacted in the community and what the current rates were in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government response reaffirms the high level of concern around cancer in our community, reinforcing that it is a health priority in Australia and also talking about the fact that the Australian government spent over $11 billion on PBS and RPBS medicines in 2015-16, of which $1.9 billion was for cancer medicines. That is, 'Around $1 in $6 of PBS expenditure subsidised cancer medicines.' That is a high cost in our community. One of the areas that was mentioned here was the need to balance the way the government responds to the issues around cancer, looking, of course, at innovative treatments and the medical responses, particularly in relation to this report, which is looking at innovative and specialist cancer drugs, and balancing that expenditure with the priority that Australian governments over many years have given to the issues around prevention—the way that we can actually build a healthier society, and the data that was included in this report about the fact that you can minimise the impact of the cost of drugs if you can look at preventive strategies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point to an ongoing issue for community affairs in this space: our concentration on the need for effective data collection. There was a particular recommendation in this report that talked about the need to have a review of the current data processes that are done in Australia around the collection of information around the whole issue of cancer in Australia. The government has not particularly answered that recommendation. It says it agrees with the intent of recommendation 2, which is around the issues of data. I value the fact that the government talks about the need—it accepts the intent. It does give data in the response, which I hope people will take the opportunity to read, about the various data collections that exist currently in the community. But the recommendation of this community affairs committee was that we needed to have these data collection processes coordinated so that everybody knew what data collection processes were available and how they interrelated so that we could get the full picture of the data being collected across the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge part of the government's response which talked about a particular process that's in place, working with Cancer Australia and looking at how data will be collected in Australia, and I value that. It's an initiative which 'aims to strengthen national cancer data capacity through the collection, transfer, collation and the reporting of standardised national data on stage, treatment and recurrence for all cancers'. That is a really valuable initiative that the government has funded. That is a step towards getting that overall view, but we need more. We need to take up the recommendation of the committee to look at a review of exactly what's happening everywhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I seek to continue my remarks because I know that this is of great interest to the community. I know that people have been waiting for this response. The response actually creates more questions, but that's the way this place operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted; debate adjourned.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  This is not my first speech. I will continue on from where I was interrupted by question time by going to the nature of the housing crisis which is gripping our nation and locking my generation out of the housing market altogether. There are currently over 200,000 applicants waiting on the Australian social housing waiting list across the country. Of those, 69,000 are classed as in great need, meaning that they are either homeless or experiencing great risk to their health and safety on the part of their housing situation. We have a situation today in Australia where the policy mechanisms which have been adopted by this chamber and the other place have worked to create a housing market in which it is now impossible for those particularly of my generation to think of home ownership as anything other than a distant dream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, quite frankly, absurd and perverse that I, as a 23-year-old Australian and senator in this place, am one of the only people of my age who could now ever consider buying or purchasing my own home. This isn't in any way surprising, and it isn't, in many ways, new. The average cost, as a percentage of disposable household income, of the average home loan has risen from 32 per cent in 1988 to 134 per cent as of 2015. Rental costs have increased 44 per cent over that time period, and, unsurprisingly, home ownership among young people has dropped significantly over that same period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very easy for us all to sit here and quote these facts and statistics in the abstract as though they don't have human consequences, but I know from firsthand experience that they do. There are over 10,000 people in my home state who will tonight go to sleep without a home. Of those 10,000, 42 per cent will be below the age of 25. In my local suburb of Rockingham and in the neighbouring suburb of Mandurah, over 200 people in each suburb will go to sleep on the streets. These people are treated as though they are not our fellow Australians. They are quite often treated as though they are lesser than the animals with which they sometimes sleep. They are moved on; they are shunned; they are treated as less-thans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They do not feature often in our political debate, and I do not find that surprising. I have been in Canberra less than a week and yet I'm already under no illusion as to why it is that issues such as homelessness and poverty so infrequently make it onto the discussion paper in this place, except when the Greens bring them up. We are paid a couple of hundred bucks every day for being here. We are on one of the highest wages in the nation. We do not see, we do not know, we do not often interact with people who experience these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't surprise me in the slightest that the legislation proposed by the government does little or nothing to address this fundamental issue. The reality is that the coalition government—which is so poorly represented in the chamber at the moment—upon coming into government, cut no less than $500 million from the homelessness sector under the guise of a budget emergency which we had to address lest the entire place burned down. It is quite funny to me that, subsequent to having to find that $500 million for the running of the nation, it was then able to find a further $500 million for a military exercise to follow the United States into a bombing campaign in Syria with no clear aim or objective or end date. Yet these are the decisions that we make in this place; these are the priorities of this chamber. You are confronted with the reality that your inability to act on this issue is causing people to die nightly on the streets of every single capital in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is within the power of this chamber to change that reality for the lives of tens of thousands of people and confront the vested interests, which so often seem to influence your decision-making processes to act in the common good, not just to tinker with negative gearing but to end it. It is within the power of this chamber to confront the scam of capital gains tax exemptions, where we—young people, workers, older Australians, mums and dads—subsidise a tax mechanism of which over 70 per cent of the profits go to the 10 per cent most wealthy households in the country. We could end that right now. We could inject billions of dollars into the affordable housing sector and into the community housing sector. We could establish, right now, a national rental standard so that nobody is forced into the situation where, if they are lucky enough to be able to rent a premises, that premises has a roof that leaks, no air conditioning or no floor. We could establish national tenancy rights standards so that tenants are always on an equal footing with landlords, and we could ensure that rental amounts are affordable for those who are faced with the need to pay them. The reality is that only 2.9 per cent of rental properties on the market right now are affordable and only 0.2 per cent of that number are affordable if you are on the Newstart payment. We could change this right now. The Greens would support any motion in this place to do so, and we back this legislation because at least it admits that the policies of this government are part of the problem—that homelessness is not inevitable and that it is not a reflection of a social or personal failing; it is a reflection of a policy failing, policies which have been passed through this chamber within my lifetime. We could do these things, but we do not. Instead, we sit here and we fiddle. We fiddle while people die on our streets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this legislation. It spasms in the right direction, but it goes nowhere near as far as is needed. I would ask every senator in this chamber who does not sit with me on the Greens benches to reflect upon why they believe that serving the vested interests of those groups who lobby for the continuation of these policies, which do nothing but exacerbate this problem, is more important than serving the people who elected them to this chamber. Thank you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I rise, too, to speak on the bills that we have before us and to say that Labor will not be opposing the passage of these bills through this chamber. However, we should be under no illusion about the government's measures in these bill, despite the rhetoric that we've heard from those opposite. They will do nothing to make housing more affordable. Sadly, that action has not been forthcoming from the Turnbull government. We have two bills that do nothing to address the housing crisis, and we need a comprehensive response to the crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of the bills before us, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017, seeks to ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible and not recognised in the cost base of the property for CGT purposes. This is an integrity measure that is meant to address concerns that some taxpayers have been claiming travel deductions without correctly apportioning costs or have claimed travel costs that were for private purposes. The second bill, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017, imposes the vacancy fee and establishes the amount payable. Broadly, the fee, which will be payable when a dwelling is left vacant, is the fee that was payable at the time of the foreign investment application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must be clear: Labor is all for ensuring that tax concessions are targeted, but we are the party which has been leading the debate on this. As previous speakers have noted on the Labor side—and on the Greens side—this is not a housing affordability measure. As we know, housing is a powerful determinant of social and economic participation. Australia is in a housing crisis—a crisis of supply and a crisis of affordability. This housing crisis has far-reaching consequences: people experiencing homelessness, people in rental stress, first home buyers and people relocating or downsizing. Recently, at the ACT Housing and Homelessness Summit, Labor's shadow minister for housing, Senator Doug Cameron, outlined the challenge for us:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government's Affordable Housing Working Group has estimated that an additional 6,000 social housing dwellings will be required each year just to keep pace with future population growth, without addressing the backlog of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A more comprehensive estimate prepared by Dr Judith Yates for the Council for Economic Development of Australia is that Australia needs 20,000 extra affordable housing dwellings each year for at least a decade to address the backlog of need among those on low to moderate incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Using the most recent estimates for the number of households in rental stress, of which there are 527,500, even if half of all the 220,000 new dwellings built each year were made affordable and available to low-moderate income households, it would take over 5 years of new supply to address rental stress amongst Australia’s poorest households. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In April this year, Labor announced a package of measures that included $88 million over two years to improve transitional housing options for women and children escaping family and domestic violence, young people exiting out-of-home care and older women under financial stress who are at risk of homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Labor government will develop and implement a national plan to reduce homelessness through the Council of Australian Governments. There is a massive gap in housing policy, and we need national leadership to address it. Labor's response to the housing and homelessness challenge requires a concerted, cooperative effort across all levels of government and society. Labor's current policies to address housing affordability include reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax and support for the creation of a bond aggregator to facilitate investment in social and affordable housing. They are important steps, but we are not stopping there. Labor is providing the national leadership that is necessary to drive a concerted national plan to address the housing crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is in the midst of a housing affordability and homelessness crisis. House prices in many major cities have skyrocketed. Home ownership rates have plummeted, and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing. The housing crisis is only getting worse. Since the government came to office in September 2013, capital city house prices have soared by 30 per cent, with increases of nearly 50 per cent in Sydney and over 30 per cent in Melbourne. Home ownership is at a 60-year low, and home ownership rates for 25- to 35-year-olds have collapsed from around 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent in the past 30 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Skyrocketing house prices have long been an issue in cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, but they are now becoming a major issue in my home state of Tasmania, with house prices in Hobart now the second highest in the nation in terms of growth, according to a recent report commissioned by the insurer QBE. The report that was put out and reported on by ABC News on 25 October 2017 notes that the median house price in Hobart is forecast to rise by 11 per cent to $470,000 by 2020, while the median price for units is expected to rise by nine per cent, reaching $360,000. These sorts of prices mean that the Australian dream is very fast getting out of reach for so many Tasmanians. It has also resulted in a further tightening of the rental market, putting further stress on those already doing it tough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot afford to ignore the human face of this. There are currently 3,000 Tasmanians on waiting lists for public and social housing. If you're on one of the lowest income support payments like youth allowance or Newstart, the possibility of just renting is getting out of reach. Something needs to change. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, if current policy settings remain in place, Australia's housing affordability crisis is likely to continue for another 40 years. In Labor's view that is completely unacceptable. This is a situation that requires action. According to the recently released Rental Affordability Index, relative to wages Hobart is the second most unaffordable Australian city after Sydney in which to rent. It is more expensive to rent a house in Hobart than it is in Melbourne or Brisbane. This disproportionately impacts on young people, who are also being priced out of the home ownership market. While Hobart's annual nine per cent growth in house prices might be appealing to people lucky enough to own their own homes, it means the door to home ownership for many young people is being slammed shut. Cashed-up speculators, many from interstate, outbid young Tasmanian first home buyers for the limited housing stock. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals, this government, do not have a good story to tell us on housing affordability. Under their watch, home ownership rates have fallen lower than at any other point in the last 60 years. First home buyers now make up only around 17 per cent of all home purchases. This is well below the historic average of 20 per cent. The coalition government appear to have no clue on how to go about fixing this problem or, if I was being unkind, I would say they didn't care, and in government the Liberals have made things worse. Since coming to government, first under Mr Abbott and now Mr Turnbull, they have refused to address unfair and distorting tax breaks for investors. They closed the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was essential for a number of complexes and projects in Tasmania that have been now completed. Without that National Rental Affordability Scheme those projects that now house hundreds of people would not have been able to go ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government defunded homelessness and community housing peak bodies. They failed to appoint a housing minister, so there is no-one leading the charge within the government. They abolished the National Housing Supply Council. This list is not the complete story on the government's failures. Unlike the Liberals, Labor has a plan for making more Australians have access to the housing market. Labor's policies will see the construction of over 55,000 new homes in Australia over three years and boost employment by 25,000 new jobs per year. Labor plans to improve housing affordability, increase financial stability, reduce homelessness and boost jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague Senator Gallagher noted in her contribution yesterday, Labor will reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. We will limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds. Labor will facilitate a COAG process to introduce uniform vacant property tax across all major cities, and Labor will re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and reinstate a leader on housing—a minister for housing. We will implement those measures, along with others, because, unlike this government, Labor believe that the current affordable housing crisis in Australia is completely unacceptable. It requires the federal government to step in and fix it. We cannot sit on the sidelines and just hope the market will sort it out, because it won't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Saturday in Australia, first home buyers are outbid at auctions by wealthy investors and property speculators who are taking advantage of some of the most generous tax concessions in the world. The current arrangements provide a bigger tax concession to an investor buying their fifth home than a young couple buying their first. How is it fair that an investor buying their fifth home receives a bigger tax concession than a young couple buying their first? Demand for housing is being turbocharged by unsustainable and distortionary tax concessions for investors. More than 90 per cent of lending for investment properties is for existing housing stock. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will take action where the Liberals are unwilling to. We will limit future negative gearing concessions to new housing and reduce the capital gains tax discount from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. These changes will moderate the growth of house prices and redirect generous tax concessions to where we most need investment—in new housing. Redirecting investment in new housing will increase housing supply and in the process will create jobs in the construction and building sector. The McKell Institute has estimated a 10 per cent increase in construction as a result of these changes, creating up to 18,500 new homes and, as I previously mentioned, as many as 25,000 new jobs per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not believe in retrospective tax changes. No current investments will be impacted by this change. The independent Parliamentary Budget Office has recosted the fiscal impact of this policy. This would improve the budget by $37.8 billion over the medium term. Labor's housing policy will create jobs, it will assist in budget repair and it will begin to fix the current housing affordability crisis. Housing prices in many major cities, as many of the senators that have contributed have indicated, have skyrocketed. Homeownership rates have plummeted, and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing—all while the government continue to sit on their hands. The current situation cannot go on. What do we have from the Turnbull government? It is a government that continues to defend existing negative gearing arrangements and capital gains tax discounts, the vast bulk of which go to those in the top 10 per cent of the income distribution. The government knows that. I'm sure Senator Smith knows that. The vast bulk of those discounts go to those in the top 10 per cent of income distribution. Change is needed and it is needed now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, Labor will not oppose these bills, but make no mistake: these measures have nothing to do with housing affordability. In fact, as I said, two of these are very clearly described as integrity measures. Any housing affordability package that does not deal with negative gearing and capital gains tax discount is a sham. The government needs to deal with both negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, otherwise it will stand condemned. Labor has been leading the way on housing affordability through Senator Cameron, as the shadow minister for housing, and only Labor will properly deal with a system that advantages investors over first home buyers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to once again put on record what is happening in my home town. As we know, in Tasmania, there have been reports produced about the housing property market squeezing out those who are most disadvantaged. Meg Webb of Anglicare's Social Action and Research Centre said that the rising prices—and I'm paraphrasing here—may be good for the market, but the same cannot be said for the 3,000 Tasmanians on waiting lists for public and social housing. When Senator Duniam came in here yesterday to make his contribution on this legislation, he also talked about Hobart and the fact that house prices are rising. But, as far as I can recall from his contribution, he made no mention of the fact that 3,000 Tasmanians are currently on waiting lists for public and social housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said when I started my contribution, Labor won't be opposing these bills, but these bills do not make a policy on housing affordability. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  Tonight about 100,000 people across Australia have no home to go to. But, meanwhile, across Australia there are many more than 100,000 homes that are vacant. That's clearly a scandal. It's a scandal that's one of the many housing scandals that's been dominating headlines for the past year. We know how serious it is. We know how hard it is for people to buy their first home. Young people, and particularly older women, are really finding it tough to stay in the housing market. So many people are close to being in a very serious situation. It's estimated that 2.3 million people are in housing stress. That means that they're one disaster away from being on the slippery slope to joining the more than 100,000 people who are homeless. If their kids get sick, if they lose their job or if they have an accident at work and their income stops, then their ability to pay their rent or their mortgage can suffer, and it's all part of this housing crisis that's been dominating the news. The issue relating to vacant houses really has scandalised people. We see more and more people sleeping on our streets—literally on our streets—and there are so many vacant houses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we have this legislation before us. What does the government come up with? The vacancy fees bill. It sounds good—fees on vacant houses. Who can argue with that? But we need to look at it more closely, because the fees only apply to foreign investors. Now, you really have to ask, when you get to this point and you realise what the government is up to: what's the difference between an investor from China and one from Point Piper, Double Bay, North Sydney, or you name it? What's the difference with who owns this vacant property? What's going on here? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government knows exactly what it's doing. There are a few reasons it has come up with this vacancy fees bill. It has come up with it because it needs to appear to be doing something, because the housing issue has been dominating the headlines so much for so long. But it's not just working-class families; many middle-class families are really worried about what the future holds for their children and for their loved ones, so the government had to come up with a position that gives the appearance they are doing something. And they need to deliver for their constituency: the big end of town, the property developers, the investment speculators, the real estate agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's also a racist aspect to this, because this is dog whistling. You can get out there and do your grabs and say: 'We're doing something. We're pursuing the foreign owners.' Why do that? There's absolutely no difference at all, but the Liberal-National Party government under Prime Minister Turnbull is doing the classic dog whistling: getting out there at every turn and talking about foreign ownership of houses. People do raise it with me. They're certainly hearing that, and they're picking up on the fear. There's no need to be fearful. We need action—we certainly need action on vacant houses—but what the government is doing here is totally minimalist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said another reason that they're doing this is to deliver for their constituency. The constituency is very generous to the Liberal and National parties and also at times to the Labor Party. Over the past 10 years, property developers, property speculators and the real estate industry have donated more than $21 million to the Labor, Liberal and National parties. I'm not saying it's Labor's constant constituency, but there have been some years when Labor have picked up more donations from the developers than they have from unions. That's a pretty worrying state of affairs, because this is a powerful industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at what goes on in our respective states, you'll see planning laws being weakened for the benefit of those companies, because, when the planning laws are weakened, they can make more profits. That's what's going on here. Again, what's the job of the Liberals and Nationals when they get into government? Deliver for their constituency. At the moment that means not going hard on the housing crisis that is making life so difficult for so many people, where they don't have certainty about their future and where many people are in insecure housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government might pay lip service to addressing the housing crisis, but for their constituency a housing crisis works for them. What I mean by that is that they make more profits, which is what their donors, the property sector, need to do. They do it very handsomely—the profits they pull in. When you look at Meriton, Mirvac and many of those other big companies, they're making millions and millions of dollars profit every year. They're pulling in big money. That, again, is why the bill before us is so absolutely minimal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the destructive side of the bill, but, even if you look at the foreign ownership side, they're not handling the issue of vacant properties in the way it needs to be. It's not a tough one. What we need to be doing when it comes to housing is recognising that we need universal housing. Housing is a human right. It's something that's recognised along with other human rights, but we barely hear about it in Australia. We have arrived at a shocking situation in this first part of the 21st century. As I said, about 100,000 people will be on the streets tonight. If 100,000 children couldn't get a place in our public schools, there'd be an outcry. It would be on the front page of the paper. If 100,000 sick people—people who had had accidents or had some worry with their health—arrived at hospitals and they couldn't be admitted, that would be scandalous. It's just not possible that it would happen. It's widely recognised, even by people who have their kids in private schools and who have private health insurance, that we need a strong public sector. When it comes to public housing, what's happened around the country, helped by successive federal governments, is that public housing has been smashed, totally discredited. The people who live there are presented as losers, people who are really just not functioning in life. The whole dignity of housing, which should be absolutely the foundation of our approach, has just been decimated in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was excellent to hear the Greens new senator Senator Andrew Bartlett speaking about the fantastic plans that the Queensland Greens are taking to this election. This is precisely the approach that we need, where we have governments committed to public and social housing in such a way that it becomes much more mainstream. I'm not talking about ending the private housing market—there is still a role for that—but we need to resurrect public housing, restore respect for it and restore its dignity so it can get back to the form that it has been in the past. The plan in Queensland, for the Queensland housing trust, is very exciting. They'll start building a million affordable homes. One of the fantastic spin-offs is that, as well as the homes, this will also provide jobs—16,000 jobs a year, over 10 years, to deliver those million affordable homes. These will be homes for life, providing people with certainty because they will be able to afford their home. They will be able to gain support from this trust according to their needs and make repayments according to what they can afford.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This might sound pie-in-the-sky in Australia at the moment, when you consider what the housing market has become. Housing effectively has become another form of money, because it is a way for those who have got two, three, four or five investment properties to be able to use the tax breaks that this government won't do anything about. People who have already got money can make more money out of the way housing works in this country. Yes, we've got to get rid of those tax breaks, but we also need to rebuild the public and the social housing system in this country. Much of Europe already has this. It is not dominated by housing which is stuck in the marketplace, with people really battling and very uncertain about what their future holds because of the price of housing and the price of rents. This really is the healthy way to go; it's the responsible way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government, the Liberal-National government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, were serious about housing, what we would be debating tonight would be the winding-down of negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, because that's a rort for those who already have money, because of the way it works. It is literally robbing billions of dollars from the public purse—money that could go into something similar to the Queensland housing trust that the Queensland Greens are taking to this election. We need something at the federal level like that. We need something like that in all states. This is the responsible way for any government to be taking Australia. Housing is going to become more of a crisis if we do not deal with it. Housing is a human right. Universal housing should be the foundation policy of all parties that are really serious about addressing people's needs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  This legislation purports to address the housing challenge. As many other participants in the debate have pointed out, it is not going to do a great deal about that. We support the legislation. We support measures to improve tax transparency, but in no way is this legislation an adequate response to the challenges which are facing Australians in relation to housing, and in no way has the government provided more generally an adequate policy response to the challenges of housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in the not very long time that I've been here, 2½ years, all I have witnessed is a government completely unable to come to grips with this challenge—organisationally in terms of their ministerial and shadow cabinet arrangements but also bureaucratically. Every time we seek information about how the government is responding to the housing crisis, we get given about three different departments—the names of three different groups of people who may or may not be responsible or leading a particular initiative. We get told that one group of people in Treasury is responsible for leading an initiative and then we find out subsequently that actually Prime Minister and Cabinet have had to step in and they are now leading some sort of working group that's convening, and shortly to be replaced by, an IDC. There is total confusion within the Commonwealth about what the goals are for housing policy, who is responsible for leading it within the bureaucracy and what the key actions are to reach those goals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the bill before the chamber today purports to be a bill to address housing but, in fact, really addresses important but, in the context of housing policy, relatively insignificant tax measures says a great deal about how the government's approaching this. It's a great shame, because we do actually have quite a significant problem. There is a very big problem with a lack of affordable rental properties. Every year, Anglicare do this terrific survey where they look at what proportion of the rental properties on the market would be available to certain kinds of income groups. When they looked at it last year, they found that singles on the age pension could afford just 2.1 per cent of the 75,000 properties that they surveyed. Think about that: if you are on the age pension and trying to exist in the private rental market, just 2.1 per cent of the properties available would be suitable for you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a kind of a myth—and I hear the National Party say this often—'All you have to do is move to Orange' or 'All you have to do is move to the country.' It's a problem in regional areas as well. People on Newstart would only be able to afford 15 per cent of the 18,000 regional properties that were surveyed in this process. Even double-income families struggle. A household with two kids and two parents on a minimum wage would be able to afford just 26 per cent of the surveyed properties. If that same family were trying to get by on Newstart, they'd have access to only 1.9 per cent of the surveyed properties. It's a big problem and it requires a serious solution. We know that one solution that works is public housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we measure housing stress, a common measure of housing stress is when your housing costs are greater than 30 per cent of your disposable income and the household income is in the bottom 40 per cent of all households. Well, only half a per cent of people in public housing are in that category. One of the key benefits of public housing is that it does represent a serious and effective response to housing stress for very low-income people. Unfortunately, more than 40 per cent of all Australians who are receiving Commonwealth rent assistance are in housing stress. They spend more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. Horrifyingly, 13 per cent of them spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent. These are issues that should shock us and it should be a time when we're thinking about how to provide more public housing and how to provide more social housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a very significant decrease in the number of public rental housing households. Between 2007 and 2014, the number of public rental households decreased from 331,000 to 317,000, a fall of four per cent. Quite a bit of that reflects a transfer of stock from public housing to community housing, because in the same period the number of mainstream community-housing households has almost doubled. It's risen very substantially. But this shifting, this pea-and-thimble trick, doesn't really go to the core of the problem. There is simply not enough affordable housing available for people who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk a lot about the pressures in capital cities. In fact, you sometimes get the impression that the main thing that drives our capital city newspapers is the property section. It's hard to go by any day of the week where there isn't a story about house prices in Sydney or Melbourne. But, actually, it is a really big problem in regional areas. I think senators will know that I grew up on the Far North Coast of New South Wales, and as a senator I have occasion to visit the communities on the North Coast of New South Wales. I spent a little bit of time earlier in the year with the Coffs Harbour Neighbourhood Centre. They tell me that Coffs Harbour actually doesn't have any crisis accommodation at all. The neighbourhood centre is in a lovely building. It's an old school. It's got one of those old school verandahs that people might remember from when they went to school—you used to hang your bag on the peg on the verandah. The good people at the Coffs Harbour Neighbourhood Centre have repurposed that area of their building. It's now a shelter for sometimes 20, sometimes 30, people living in Coffs Harbour who really don't have anywhere to go each evening. There is no crisis accommodation. The neighbourhood centre is not in a position to provide crisis accommodation for these people, but they are able to provide them with a place out of the rain—albeit not inside, but a place on a verandah out of the rain—where they can get a little bit of food in the morning and actually get a little bit of care. They assist these desperate people in their desperate circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's troubling that there isn't a more structured response to these problems in our regions. Places like Coffs Harbour might not be growing as fast as the rest of the state, but it's still projected to grow very significantly between now and 2050. I struggle to get any real sense that either the state government in New South Wales or the Commonwealth government is thinking seriously about how these coastal areas cope with some very specific challenges that they face in terms of housing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shelter NSW, the peak group that represents housing providers and advocates on housing issues, did some great work, which they released in March this year, which took a look at regional perspectives on housing and homelessness. It's a very useful document, and I encourage senators to go and have a look at it. They go region by region and create a very specific breakdown of the kinds of issues in each of those places that are confronting those communities. In Coffs Harbour, they're finding that house prices and rents on the coast are pushing people westward for affordable rentals. Locally, certain areas have remained affordable, but the housing is run down and the market is becoming very geographically stratified. In a small town everyone knows everyone else, and there are sometimes families—a lot of people with the same name—and it only takes one person with your surname in your family to do the wrong thing for everybody in that family to be shut out of the rental market, because real estate agents are willing to apply essentially discriminatory practices in accepting or rejecting tenants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The development of university campuses increases competition for housing. Students tend to displace locals, especially in low-end housing. In coastal towns like Coffs Harbour and my own community on the Tweed, there is huge seasonal variation in rental prices. Rents go up dramatically over Christmas and people can find themselves homeless at that point, particularly if you've got a lease that ends in the summer; it's likely that that won't be renewed because the owner is in a position to chase much higher rents from temporary holiday rentals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some real challenges in regional Australia with housing. There are real challenges across the country, but the problem with the bill before us and with all of the policy settings presented by the coalition is that they're not addressing this in any systematic, focused or energetic way. There is a disregard for the issue and an apparent unwillingness to take it seriously. Labor has put a range of policies on the table, particularly around tax, negative gearing and capital gains reform. Unfortunately, these—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  Today is World Diabetes Day. The theme for World Diabetes Day 2017 is women and diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 199 million women are currently living with diabetes worldwide. It is the ninth leading cause of death in women globally, causing 2.1 million deaths per year. People who have diabetes lose their ability to properly regulate their blood sugar. Out-of-control blood sugar can lead to nerve damage, heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and lower limb amputation. The total annual cost impact of diabetes in Australia is estimated at $14.6 billion a year. Around 1.7 million Australians already have diabetes, and they are joined by 280 Australians every day—about one person every five minutes. This means that eight per cent of the Australian population is already living with diabetes. This is expected to increase to 14 per cent over the next two decades. Diabetes is the leading cause of preventable blindness in Australia, and there are more than 4,400 diabetic amputations every year in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Socially and economically disadvantaged people in every country carry that great burden of diabetes and are often the most affected financially. Most people with diabetes have a form of the illness, like type 2, that disproportionately strikes people, young and old, who may be overweight and sedentary. But when a patient develops type 1 diabetes, their body attacks and destroys its own ability to produce any insulin at all. No-one knows why, but, at the moment, type 1 diabetes accounts for 10 per cent of all diabetes diagnoses in Australia, affects nearly 16,000 Australians and is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting children in Australia. Type 1 diabetes low blood sugar can end in hypoglycaemic fits or even death, while high blood sugar might develop into diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic coma and, within a week, death, to say nothing of the severe long-term health impacts that people with type 1 diabetes live with. Because of this, type 1 diabetes is responsible for significant financial and emotional burdens on those afflicted and their families and the community. Many who suffer complications lose their incomes because they cannot work and, moreover, treatment can be expensive. Insulin is unaffordable for many people in low- and middle-income countries, where most with diabetes are living, and, without insulin, type 1 diabetics die. Even in high-income countries like Australia, the cost of best-practice treatment, like continuous blood glucose monitoring, is beyond the reach of most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have come to learn a lot about type 1 diabetes over the years, as one of my staff has the disease. I have seen how well he manages. But that is all it is; it is just managing. Management of diabetes is all there can be, because there is no cure. While type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, a healthy lifestyle is an important part of effective management of the disease. Indeed, up to 70 per cent of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented through the adoption of a healthy lifestyle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are on record as welcoming the government's investment in diabetes treatment and research, including the provision of free continuous glucose monitoring devices to eligible children and people under the age of 21 with type 1 diabetes, but we do call on the government to extend this much-needed support at the very least to pregnant women and adults with severe hypoglycaemia and limited awareness of their condition who have never been able to afford the technology and the improvements in their health care that would provide them with a degree of safety. If the government wants to save lives, and in the long-term save taxpayers money, this is a decision the government must make. Today we mark World Diabetes Day, and we hope for all of those people who live with the disease that we find a cure and diabetes will be prevented in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  This is not my first speech, once again! Tonight I would like to challenge one of the persistent myths which surround my generation. There are those within this chamber and beyond who believe that we do not care about the world around us or what happens in this place. Well, we do. We are the ones who will live in the world that is being built here. This is why we are so frustrated by the petty game playing which now seems to pass for political debate in this place. It angers us, it saddens us and it causes us to disengage. You do not seem to care about our issues and so we do not care about you. You do not seem to take us seriously and so we do not take you seriously. But we do understand that, for our generation, everything is now on the line—our jobs, our homes, our education, the people that we love and the planet on which we live. We, the young people of Australia, do not have time to waste. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament should be a place in which our values play out. It must no longer be a place in which members of the political establishment serve the vested interests of those individuals and organisations who seek to hijack our democracy for their personal gain. Our generation, the young people of Australia, are not afraid to state this clearly. We are not afraid to confront the reality that, for so many Australians, the idea of living in a society based on justice, fairness and equality is becoming an ever more distant dream. We feel that fundamental urgency that drives us to act. For evidence of this, it is necessary to look no further than the vibrant and passionate work of groups such as the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and Oaktree or indeed to youth-led organisations which are so often, sadly, underfunded, such as headspace. However, as a recent entrant and rather unexpected member of this chamber, I can tell you that we look to this place and so often see nothing but wasted time—wasted time ignoring the housing crisis, wasted time denying climate change, wasted time avoiding marriage equality. Young people look to this place and are infuriated by the extent to which our politicians are willing to run the clock on our future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do in fact care about our world and our future. We are a generation alive with the desire to rise to the challenges of our time. Contrary to what many in this place might conveniently believe, our lack of interest and our anger is born not of ignorance but of knowledge. Through your words here and the actions that often play out, the members of this chamber show us that it is in fact you who do not care about our future, and we are so often left to wonder where and why that same desire has disappeared in all of you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I won't respond to Senator Dastyari's interjection. Too many people in this place are lured in by him in that very way. I congratulate you, Acting Deputy President Kitching, on your first time of serving on the Temporary Chairs of Committees. It's an honour to be in that chair and it's nice to be here on the first occasion of your time in it. Could I also just say in response to Senator Steele-John's recent contribution that I might not be as young as the senator, but, believe me, I still have plenty of passion in this place for the Australian people. I think we're better when we're all working together—youth and older people; country, city and regions—and that's why I'm very pleased to put on the record tonight some remarks around the suicide prevention trials that I visited in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased, frankly, to be assisting the<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span>member for Franklin, Julie Collins, in her role as the shadow minister for mental health. Labor is committed to continue to work with the Turnbull government in bipartisanship to reduce the very significant rate of suicide right across this country. We are also committed to rolling out 12 suicide prevention trial sites, as per the National Mental Health Commission recommendation. I'm pleased that the government adopted Labor's position, which was declared early in the 2016 campaign. They indicated eight trial sites initially but moved, finally, to 12. Indeed, there are now 12 suicide prevention trial sites being rolled out, including in the western part of New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the last sitting period, I've been fortunate enough to spend some time in western New South Wales. I visited the areas of Cobar, Bourke and Brewarrina. I met with inspirational people out there—inspiring mental health service providers and community leaders—who were more than willing to discuss the strengths of their community but also the very concerning issue of suicide prevention, which is on their radar. I met with mental health service providers, the local PHN and community leaders from, as I said, Cobar, Bourke and Brewarrina and Walgett as they were participating in a suicide prevention trial discussion. I welcomed very much this opportunity to meet with mental health service providers and listen to them about what's happening on the ground so that we can find ways to reduce the thousands of lives that are sadly lost to suicide each year. I would, personally, like to thank each one of them for their generosity in sharing their knowledge and insights with me. I acknowledge the passion and dedication they have to the task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extremely encouraging that New South Wales, given the size of our population, has two suicide prevention sites: one in western New South Wales and one on the North Coast, which I will certainly be visiting early in the new year. It is particularly promising that western New South Wales was chosen as a trial site. According to SANE Australia, suicide rates in rural Australia are consistently 40 per cent higher than the rates in metropolitan Australia. Rural and remote areas need policies that are tailored to their needs, which do not necessarily translate to the same as those in urban areas. My home place is only an hour and a half north of Sydney, but it might as well be 500 miles away for many people because of the limitation on access to services and the challenge of putting petrol in their car when they're in insecure employment and have, perhaps, one child who is unwell. These are the sorts of pressures that mount on people that end up putting them into a frame of mind where they see a tunnel and hopelessness descends. We need to be able to interrupt that and we need to be able to do it particularly for our Indigenous people—our first nation people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the four local government areas chosen in Western Australia, first nation people are very significantly represented. It is extremely encouraging that the western New South Wales PHN identified first nation people as a high-priority group for the trial site. But, as Senator Williams is here, I think they've got room for a few broken-down shearers, as you describe some of the people who are out in the bush. So it is a genuine community response, but noticing in that community that there are differentiated needs that require an adequate and differentiated response. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elders in Brewarrina, first nation elders in particular, made it clear that identity issues are contributing to the experience of mental ill health for our first nation people. We need to make sure that we are listening to the concerns of the first nation people and allowing them their voice in their own community. They made it extremely clear that they have plans to improve the wellbeing of the community. But can I put on the record my alarm at being in a state-of-the-art building for child health—a building that was $2 million in production—and hearing about women in the local area who were part of the CDP, were unable to attend their CDP and were losing their income because there was nowhere safe for them to put their children, despite the fact that there were two childcare rooms ready and waiting for use in that community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I've spoken in this chamber on a number of occasions of how sick and tired Gold Coast residents are of the LNP representation they've been getting, or not getting, for many years now. The Gold Coast is Queensland's second-biggest city. It is Australia's sixth-biggest city, but unfortunately it has been grossly let down by the LNP, who currently hold every state and federal seat. Now, you would think that an area that has consistently returned members of one political party would be recognised and rewarded by that political party, but unfortunately the Gold Coast has had its interests ignored and has been taken for granted by the LNP year after year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there is no better example of the Gold Coast being taken for granted by the LNP than when it comes to the M1, the highway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast that literally tens of thousands of motorists use every single day, going to and from Brisbane and going further afield. Everyone who drives on the M1 understands the magnitude of the problem that exists there. I am personally caught in traffic there on regular occasions; my staff are as well. Many people I know—businesses and residents from the Gold Coast—spend far too much time sitting on that highway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have the different parties done to deal with this problem? Despite Labor not currently holding any seats on the Gold Coast at a state or federal level, Labor has actually come through for the Gold Coast and has come through on the M1. Just in this last term, the Palaszczuk government has funded upgrades to the M1 in two different spots to the tune of $424 million. That money has been locked away in the state budget. Contracts have been signed to start at least one of those two upgrades and work is going to be progressing before too long. So the job is underway. In addition to that, during this state election campaign the Palaszczuk government has committed another $206 million towards a further upgrade of the M1 closer to the New South Wales border. Putting that together, those three different upgrades will mean that Gold Coast motorists travelling on the M1 will have at least six lanes between Brisbane and the New South Wales border. That will make a real difference to Gold Coast residents and businesses in years ahead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let's look at that record of Labor, which has not a single seat on the Gold Coast at a state or federal level but has delivered hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade that highway, and compare it with that of the LNP, which currently holds every state and federal seat on the Gold Coast. Let me take some time to tell you about the dollars and the commitments they have made to fix the M1: nothing. They have done nothing. They have every state and federal seat there and they have done absolutely nothing to upgrade the major highway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. In fact, they've actually done worse than nothing. The last time they were in government, when Tim Nicholls was the Treasurer, the aspiring LNP Premier, he did not spend a single dollar on upgrading the M1. What did all of those Gold Coast LNP members actually do when they were in state parliament last time with Tim Nicholls? Did they not do anything to get any dollars? They certainly didn't manage to get a single dollar spent on that highway by their own Treasurer. Tim Nicholls actually made cuts to road funding across Queensland. He didn't spend a dollar on the M1 and actually cut funding to improve roads around Queensland. He actually went even further and removed the idea of a second M1 from all of the main roads department's planning documents, which would have actually led to planning going ahead for a second M1. So, nothing at all done; no dollars; cuts to funding; and removing the corridor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let's not even start talking about the federal LNP and the fight that had to be had with them to get fair funding for the M1. The state LNP, in the context of a state election campaign, have finally discovered that the M1 is a problem for Gold Coast motorists, and they're running around now committing to build a second M1, what has been dubbed the M2. What we don't know is how they're going to pay for it. They say it will cost only $500 million and they say they've got half the money from the federal government, but we haven't got a federal government committing to it yet. The only way to pay for this and the $2.5 billion it will cost is to impose a toll on Gold Coast motorists. That is not what we need.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:41</span>):  It's sometimes difficult to recall where friendships begin. For me, a very special friendship began in the spring of 1996 at a local Chinese restaurant in Garema Place here in Canberra on a crowded table of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, liberally minded young people. All had descended on the nation's capital from different corners of our country, eager and excited to be doing their part in the newly elected Howard government. It was politics that brought us together, but a passing remark about our mutual love of Neil Diamond music cemented a 20-year friendship. Tonight I would like to share both my memories and the memories of others and have them recorded in this special place about a special person. Her name is Anna McPhee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the memorial service held for Anna on Saturday, 8 September at St Clement's Anglican Church Mosman, her friend of 20 years Michael Priebe reflected on a long friendship. Such was the warmth of the response from mourners to Michael's heartfelt and poetic reflections, they're worth sharing this evening. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My first impressions of Anna were cultivated at the parties she hosted,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Which quickly gained notoriety for all the right reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These parties often had a theme that required some form of dressing up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This was a deliberate tactic on Anna's part—it compelled attendees to make an effort and shed both their usual attire and their straight-laced demeanour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anna's parties were well-catered, raucous affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For me, Anna's enthusiastic hosting of revelry was initially perplexing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anna didn't drink or smoke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But it was Anna who instigated dancing,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anna's loud, infectious laugh created an overwhelmingly light hearted and inclusive ambience of fun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I once asked her why she loved hosting parties if she didn't partake in alcohol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Isn't being the only sober person at a party boring" I enquired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anna's response was telling "I just love watching people have fun".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anna was also a lover of politics—more than a lover; an active participant and influencer. While <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> has never recorded Anna's spoken word, it has regularly recorded her influence. For over 20 years Anna's contribution to contemporary conservative politics was profound: the first female chief of staff to a New South Wales Liberal Premier, Barry O'Farrell; the first female deputy campaign director in any Liberal Party division across Australia; and the key driver of the New South Wales Liberals 1996 marginal seats strategy delivering John Howard a prime ministership and the federal parliament one of the largest ever numbers of coalition female parliamentarians. This achievement was not the product of a silver spoon, but of years of old-fashioned blood, sweat and tears, honest effort and having had an earlier start than most. Delivering her father Bill McPhee's eulogy in September 2008 we were reminded that she had gone to her first political event in the womb in 1970: 'So I was saying, "Turn on the lights," well before Fraser and Howard in 1975,' she remarked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At her memorial service, former New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell remarked, 'Anna is undoubtedly one of the best MPs the New South Wales Liberal Party never had.' New South Wales Liberals got a glimpse of this in a courageous speech Anna gave not long before her passing. Most didn't realise Anna was very ill and in pain when she took those steps onto the stage at the New South Wales Liberal Party Futures Convention. Elizabeth Warner, who joined Anna on the day, said she was determined to have her say. When Elizabeth asked Anna what her plan B was, the response was clear: 'There is no Plan B. This is it.' With that, Anna mustered all of her strength and delivered a powerful call to action to the party, calling for preselection based on merit, not faction, arguing for and encouraging Liberals to listen to women. Australia's Liberal women have lost their strongest advocate before she even really got started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anna was a bridge. She weaved with ease through different worlds and connected people from different industries and walks of life. Anna was always a champion of and for women. She always knew her worth and empowered other women to know theirs. In 2004, the Howard government appointed her chief executive of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency. Later she was the chair of the employer-member organisation Diversity Council Australia. On her passing, the chairman of the Diversity Council, General David Morrison AO, summed up Anna's contribution wonderfully, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anna was a beacon of courage and resilience for all of us who seek to make the world a better and more equal place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The council has since renamed their annual oration the Anna McPhee Memorial Diversity and Inclusion Oration to honour Anna's contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there was always more with Anna. She represented Australia at the United Nations convention on women, addressed the topic of women in leadership at Stanford University forums and, until her illness, led the Retail Council as its chief executive. In Anna's eulogy to her father, she attributed her feminist passion to him, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Dad was a great feminist role model … Dad pioneered 14 years unpaid maternity leave, training and development and mentoring. He strongly believed that women had a role beyond the family in business, politics and the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Easter, Anna faced a choice. In January, Anna had gone into remission after spending a year courageously fighting against an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Anna shared with her family and friends her decision: 'To live as well as I can until I can't.' 'This,' she said to a dear friend, 'is so much more fun and impactful, in my experience, than living at cost.' Her response to her second diagnosis was inspiring and instructive. Bucket list drawn up, Anna embarked upon a series of other journeys—to Hawaii with her sisters, a State of Origin game in Brisbane with some of her favourite guy mates, a transcontinental trip on the Indian-Pacific and a seaplane ride to the Cottage Point Inn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anna always had strong male friendships, and none was more important than that with her husband, Reggie. So very proud was Anna of Reggie. She loved Reggie and she loved his love of his family, his love of his country, his service and, of course, his political banter. Our thoughts are with Reggie, now without his Anna. Anna's sister, Donna, summed up a life lived full at the memorial service. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anna lived a full life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She had a self-belief and always gave it her best shot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She didn't dwell on disappointments but learnt from her mistakes before fiercely moving onto the next project or goal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She showed that it is possible to be a woman with a high-powered career and still make time for family and friends,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To make the most of opportunities without compromising her values,</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">To be successful while promoting and supporting other women and men to be their best,</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">To be taken seriously but still look for and find humour in the most unlikely places,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To be decisive, strong, assertive</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And also warm, kind, caring and feminine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anna did not use illness as an excuse to relinquish the weight of responsibility. Her acceptance of her situation helped us to come to some level of acceptance of both her mortality and our own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my fondest and most easily recalled memories is dancing on a coffee table for what must have been hours and deciding to pull aside the curtains only to discover that a new dawn was breaking. I remember we were dancing and singing over and over again to that John Denver classic <span style="font-style:italic;">Annie's Song</span>. Written by John Denver for his then wife, the song is said to have become a prayer for him: 'You fill up my senses like a night in the forest, like a mountain in springtime, like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean. Let us always be with you. Come let us love you. Come love us again.' Preparing for Anna's final farewell, Nina Blackwell made this beautiful reflection: 'For all of us, we are lucky to have known her, but our lives are smaller without her.' Vale Anna McPhee.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Mr President, congratulations on your elevation to the presidency of this great chamber. I wish this evening to speak about the Davis Street Kindergarten program at the Uniting AgeWell Carnsworth Community aged-care home in Kew in Victoria. I want to state from the outset how impressed and moved I was by this program, and I commend Uniting AgeWell Carnsworth Community and the Davis Street Kindergarten, their dedicated staff, teachers and volunteers who make this wonderful program possible. I would especially like to thank Amanda Wallace, Ruth Wallbridge and Melinda Gregory for their dedication to this program. You really are changing people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The kindergarten program has been held one morning a week at the Uniting AgeWell Carnsworth Community aged-care home during school terms since 1 June 2016 and it has been an enormous success. Each week, an average of 28 children and up to 20 residents participate. The children are dropped off by their parents in the morning and then transported back to the kindergarten by bus, supervised by two teachers and a volunteer. The room is arranged and organised by the teachers with multiple stations and activities for both the children and the residents. A lot of research has been done on the benefits for older people when mixing and interacting with young children. I've seen this program implemented in the United States. To be able to see that here in Australia firsthand was a great privilege. Through this program, very special relationships are formed in an unhurried and relaxed environment. They read books, tell stories, paint, do puzzles together and, very importantly, listen to each other without any judgement. Listening to the chatter of young giggling girls talking about a birthday party with one of the residents was so natural—for them to be able to explain to the senior person that she really didn't fit the age criteria for this particular birthday party because she was a grown-up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was extraordinary to hear some of the great stories that have come out of this program. One particular gentleman was diagnosed with dementia and wasn't able to write his name or communicate for some five years. Through this program, he was able to write his name. Although this particular gentleman can no longer verbalise his feelings and talk to the children, his eyes follow them around the room. That, to me, is such a blessing for this particular gentleman. The comments that were recorded in the memory book that was created for this program by his lovely wife were so touching. This program is beneficial to both the residents and the children. It's been particularly beneficial for the children who have various challenges—children who, perhaps, aren't as engaged normally. The teachers explained to me how these particular young children have grown in their confidence and the way they interact with each other. It gives these children extra attention and helps them to develop greater empathy and self-esteem. Ruth and her team keep a diary to document the benefits to both parties. Alongside photographs of the children and residents playing and learning together, four-year-old Ella wrote that she has 'another grandma and her name is Thea'. I have to tell you about Thea. Thea is 106 years of age, and to see her talking and interacting with the children and with me that day was such a delight. I have to say, though, that by the time we were leaving she did tell me that she was 108. One of the staff said, 'Oh, she gets confused,' and I said, 'Well, at 106, I think she deserves to be whatever age she wants to be.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought this was so special, because so many children don't have grandparents and, as we know, so many residents in aged-care homes around this country don't have visitors. It was really warming to see these beautiful and meaningful relationships and the interaction between the generations. But I'd also like to commend the teachers who are undertaking a study so that they can document the benefits for the children, because, as I said earlier, we know that there's already data that verifies the success and the benefits for older, senior members of the community when they can interact with a kindergarten or a school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge that the HESTA Aged Care Awards are on again this year, and this program has been nominated for a national award. But, as far as I'm concerned, whether they win or not is irrelevant, because they are already winners. This is a win-win situation for the kindergarten, for the students, for the residential home and, particularly, for those older Australians, so congratulations to all of those involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I also had the privilege of visiting the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness &amp; Research Centre in Melbourne. In September this year the singer and actress Olivia Newton-John visited Canberra. We really know her more fondly as one of the favourite daughters of this country. She came to Canberra to meet Australia's political leaders and discuss how to support the country's medical researchers to continue making discoveries for people living with cancer. While I was speaking to Olivia, she encouraged me to visit the centre, and I'm so happy that I did, because what I saw firsthand—the dedication of the nursing and medical care staff, the world-leading cancer researchers and the research that is actually taking place in this centre—is leading the way in this country. It lived up to all expectations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I met with Cherie Cheshire, the director of cancer services, and Penelope Sanderson, the divisional manager integrated cancer services, who showed me around the cancer wellness centre. Olivia was very definite when she spoke about the benefits of the centre and that you need to treat the entire person. This is a holistic approach, and the centre reflected that with great empathy, support and encouragement. You can see that there are traces of Olivia throughout the wellness centre and that she has been hands-on in designing, along with the architects, the sort of centre that she wanted, even down to the point that there were a couple of tables that had been built from timber off her own property.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The research that's going on in the laboratories there is just magnificent. The way the whole centre is set out is that up on the top two floors you have a ward of people that are being treated for their cancer and you have the researchers. There's such interaction there between the clinical caring and researchers and the patients themselves. The benefits that are coming out of having patients so close to the researchers is testament to the sort of success that they've had in their research. I wanted to particularly thank Associate Professor Andrew Weickhardt, Dr Doug Fairlie and Dr Erinna Lee for the time that they spent showing me through the laboratories, which allowed me to have a greater understanding of the research that they're undertaking there. I want to encourage other senators and people who are listening here tonight. We have some magnificent research happening in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know those who have been touched—and we've all been touched and our families have been touched—by cancer. We know the important work that has been undertaken at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute and we know that its integration with the Olivia Newton-John centre will lead to better outcomes for those who have been diagnosed with cancer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't stress enough the importance of us continuing to fund the research. It was fantastic, when she was up here, that Mr Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Labor Party, committed $20 million to go to that research, if we are successful at the next federal election. When you're in a place where there are so many challenges for people's health, we need to invest and do more as far as research is concerned. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about the government's decision not to support the Referendum Council's key recommendation for a voice to this parliament. I stand with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are outraged at this blatant snub and disregard for the advice this government so clearly sought and ignored. Senator Di Natale and I have written to the Prime Minister, calling on him to reconsider his position and to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, parliamentarians and the community to achieve constitutional reform to establish a voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Referendum Council's recommendations were the result of a huge amount of work, commitment and consensus building in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Referendum Council's role was to lead the process for national consultations and community engagement on constitutional recognition, including a concurrent series of Indigenous designed and led consultations. The terms of reference outlined that the council was required to report to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition by 30 June this year. There were a series of things that it was supposed to report on, including the outcomes of national consultations and community engagement about constitutional recognition, including community led consultations; options for a referendum proposal, steps for finalising a proposal and possible timing for a referendum; and constitutional issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is deeply disrespectful of the government to ignore the recommendations and the work achieved by the Referendum Council. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was the result of bringing together over 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples at the first-nations national constitutional convention. The convention resolved to call for the establishment of a first-nations voice—commonly called 'the voice'—as an enshrined body in the Australian Constitution. The report suggested that specific functions of the body should be set out in legislation outside the Constitution and should include the functions of monitoring the use of the heads of power in section 51 and section 122. The body would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the first peoples of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart also called for another reform—the establishment of a makarrata commission. The purpose of the makarrata commission would be to supervise truth telling about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' histories, particularly, for example, dispossession, and to supervise the processes for agreement-making between governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In the words of the Uluru statement:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Makarrata is the culmination of our agenda: <span style="font-style:italic;">the coming together after a struggle</span>. It captures our aspirations for a fair and truthful relationship with the people of Australia and a better future for our children based on justice and self-determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The objectives of the statement were broad, reflecting the specific need for substantial reform, but did not specify any finer details of the proposed changes to the Constitution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The desire for substantial reform coming out of that national constitutional convention is really clear and was supported so strongly. The Turnbull government has rejected this call for the establishment of a voice. The rejection of the voice shows a blatant disregard for the very voices the government asked to hear from. It does, in fact, highlight the need for there to be a voice to parliament: what clearer demonstration of that need can there be than the government's rejection of this? It's so ironic. This is required so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' voices are no longer disregarded and they don't go unheard. In a joint response to the Referendum Council's report the Prime Minister and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government does not believe such an addition to our national representative institutions is either desirable or capable of winning acceptance in a referendum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens call on the government to reconsider this position and their position on constitutional reform. It is particularly disappointing that the government did not consult any key Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander bodies or representatives or go back to the co-chairs of the council to address any issues they found with the recommendations in the Referendum Council's report. It is devastating that the government has rejected this landmark work out of hand. It is obvious, from answers to questions in estimates, that the government did not seek to ascertain the level of support from the broader community for the concept of a voice to the parliament, and they have misread the community's response. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent polling shows that the Australian community are supportive of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to the parliament. The Greens believe that, with the right collaboration between the parliament, Australia's first peoples and the community, this proposal would be capable of getting popular support. A survey conducted across Australia in August by the University of New South Wales and Griffith University found that voters across the political spectrum strongly support an enshrined body in the Australian Constitution. The vast majority of Australians do want to see progress and a positive way forward for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. So, the truth is the government are out of touch with the community and they just don't support the concept themselves. They just don't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, Australia's federal, state and territory human rights bodies urged political leaders to work across party lines to deliver constitutional reform for Australia's first peoples. They issued a joint statement suggesting Australia's political institutions have failed to take into account the views of our first peoples. The joint statement supported the Uluru statement, as it would affirm the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which Australia has endorsed. They concluded that providing our first peoples with a national voice that is enshrined in the Constitution is an opportunity. We must listen.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to bring to the attention of the Senate a letter, written by a lot of people, but led by Fiona Stanley, calling for revision of the government's decision to reject the Referendum Council's proposal. This is signed by nearly a thousand prominent organisations and individuals and supported by thousands of members of the community. As representatives in this parliament, it is essential that, no matter the challenges, we do this work and commit to building support for a voice to parliament for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We need action on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' recognition in the form that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples support and have called for. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have been loud and clear in their view, and there is no more eloquent statement of what they are calling for than the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It is not radical to recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should have a formalised voice to make comment on legislation and policies that affect them. The Uluru Statement from the Heart is unanimous. It is a strong, clear and passionate call for action, and it should not be ignored. The Australian Greens strongly support the Uluru statement and the urgent suggestion of the Australian Council of Human Rights Authorities that our political parties should heed the Uluru Statement from the Heart and implement real change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens are willing to work across party lines to ensure there is action for real change and to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Referendum Council's recommendations. We stand in support of the right to self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and for a voice to parliament, to ensure that there is a powerful way for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be heard on legislation that affects them. We call on the government to reconsider their position, to support the Uluru Statement from the Heart and to support the recommendations of the Referendum Council. A vast amount of work, a vast amount of consensus building around these concepts, has gone into this. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples rejected symbolism and wanted real action, which is what the Uluru Statement from the Heart would deliver.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:10</span>):  I rise this evening to talk about salmon aquaculture in my home state of Tasmania and, in particular, the job prospects associated with plans to expand the salmon industry. The salmon industry grows and sells fish. For all intents and purposes, this is the industrial production of protein, with an eye on growing protein at the lowest possible unit cost, to remain competitive and outcompete other forms of protein. There are big plans to expand the industry. The industry is experiencing growing pains, polluting the environment and riding roughshod over local communities, mostly thanks to weak Tasmanian state Liberal and Labor governments, who have stubbornly refused to properly regulate the industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry is also at war with itself and in the courts over this poor regulation. Huon Aquaculture, the nation's second-biggest salmon farmer, is suing the state and federal governments over poor regulation and allegations of regulatory capture, or favouritism towards the No. 1 player, Tassal. It's hard to fathom a private company taking a state or federal government to court over lack of regulation, but that's exactly what's happening. Public support for and trust in the industry are at an all-time low. The expansion of fish farming, with its impact on the environment and local communities, is now a significant election issue, and we are expecting a state election in Tasmania by May next year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say here tonight that the Greens are the only political party who have consistently held the government and the industry to account. The Senate inquiry that I initiated in 2015 was very important in shining a light on the impacts of the industry and why it needed significant independent regulation and checks and balances. If some of the Greens' recommendations had been adopted, we probably wouldn't be in the mess we're in now. We'll continue to stand with Tasmanian communities and we'll continue to protect the environment. We are opposed to the expansion of the industry on the east coast of Tasmania and want farming at Macquarie Harbour wound back to pre-2012 expansion levels given the significant environmental damage we've seen in that beautiful part of the world. We want to see the industry go onshore, using sustainable closed-loop farming methods, powered by renewable energy, or we want to see the industry go way offshore rather than expanding around the beautiful inshore waters in our state of Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this background, the government and Tassal are spruiking jobs as the basis of their social licence to operate, and the industry continues to expand, especially on the east coast. Thus it has always been in Tasmania, starting with hydro's expansion and the damming of the Franklin—jobs. Then it was the Wesley Vale pulp mill—jobs; the Tamar Valley pulp mill—jobs; propping up a failed forestry industry—jobs; and now controversial salmon farm expansion—jobs, jobs, always jobs. In the case of salmon, how much of this promise is just a jobs mirage? Last week a document was sent to my office. It was sent anonymously. As such, I declare from the outset that I'm not able to verify its status. It doesn't say 'commercial-in-confidence', 'private', 'confidential' or 'internal', but it looks very much to me like an investment proposal to either invest company funds or seek finance to upgrade technology to enable the replacement of unskilled feeding jobs on salmon lots with much fewer skilled jobs and new technology. It clearly suggests that this is the future of the industry—it says 'exciting' future of the industry—if the industry is going to thrive and compete with offshore salmon companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After doing my own research and having discussions with stakeholders, I'm confident that the information is genuine and that it raises legitimate questions that demand answers—questions and answers clearly in the public interest. It would be a very elaborate exercise to have falsified this document. It has very detailed analysis of very specific subject matter, including detailed cost tables and technical specifications. Even though there is no indication that it is sensitive or commercial-in-confidence, I have assumed that it is and have therefore redacted any data not directly relevant to public and, indeed, political claims about Tassal's future employment of Tasmanians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The document I talk of is authored by the head of aquaculture and the CIO, chief investment officer, at Tassal, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Future Feeding</span>. It sets out a proposal to automate Tassal's feeding program. The document states:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is this automated feeding program such a good investment? Because it involves job cuts. The document states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Leveraging centralised feed systems and technology means that it will be possible for one feed operator to concurrently feed nine pens, whereas the current max is three.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The detailed tables set out labour cost savings and show a projected increase in feed staff under Tassal's current feeding method from 65 to 105 by 2025. However, using the automated feed system method, instead of an increase in staff over coming years, the number of feed staff in 2025 will be just 35, nearly a third. The document even sets out planned redundancies for workers who have yet to be employed by Tassal. The document helpfully explains that this land-based central feeding will result in a reduction in the number of feeders to a third of existing method requirements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, again, why is Tassal's feeding strategy and its commercial considerations of interest to this Senate and a matter of public interest? It is because Tassal, with the full-throated support of both the Liberal and state Labor parties, have been telling Tasmanians that their salmon farm expansion in Tasmania will create jobs—jobs in regional centres like Triabunna, adjacent to the pristine Okehampton Bay. When announcing their plan to put 800,000 fish into Okehampton Bay, the Tassal CEO said that it could create up to 40 local jobs. But this document sets out a very different reality. The document clearly shows that Tassal is at least planning to cut jobs if it upgrades its automatic feeding systems. This information document clearly outlines a loss of 20 jobs directly at Okehampton Bay under this future scenario, associated with upgrading to higher-skilled, better-paid workers, mostly based in Hobart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to the state government, who are spruiking a job-rich salmon industry as a basis for a social licence for the Okehampton Bay project, is: are you aware of a plan to cut jobs and use technology? Are you aware if it has been accepted by the Tassal board? Are the 40 jobs stated by the Tassal CEO in his public statements net of the 20 jobs to be lost as forecast in this document, or is it only likely to be 20 jobs at Okehampton Bay—half the figure publicly stated by stakeholders?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, it is up to a company if it wants to invest its shareholder funds or seek finance to restructure, upgrade or innovate and replace labour with technology. That's a sad fact of the commercial world, especially for workers. Indeed, it is the future of work, which we all have to face, across many industries. Fine, if that's your decision. I just don't want to see Tassal or Jeremy Rockliff or any other politicians running around telling porky pies, giving communities a false sense of hope and using misinformation to win political campaigns. It's important this is cleared up and, if it proves that this document is the future pathway for the salmon industry in Tasmania, it must be factored into social, economic and political debate on salmon farm expansion in Tasmania. In my last 10 seconds, I seek leave to table a document that I've referred to in my speech.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:20</span>):  On 27 June 2009, I attended a splendid book launch in Brisbane. It was a book about Hughie Williams called <span style="font-style:italic;">A Life</span>. I was surrounded by greatness at that launch. My friend Senator Alex Gallagher, who was then the TWU federal president, was there, as was the then Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, and the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. There were special messages from people like the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and Kim Beazley did the actual launch. They gathered together to celebrate a wonderful life, which was surrounded by struggle. In fact, Hughie, in his autobiography, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was a struggle through life. At birth, it was a struggle to survive—the struggle to live and survive a terrible early life of poverty and loneliness; the struggles in the trade union movement, helping workers and their families to enjoy a decent life; the struggle to help democratise the Labor party in Queensland; the incredible struggles through sport and many, many injuries; and the struggle to reach my ambition of being a champion sportsman and representing my country, Australia, at the Olympics. In my sporting, political and union life, there were many physical and mental injuries. I have survived them all and I believe my life can be a lesson for others if they're prepared to take up the struggle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the opening of the book, the wonderful Bill Hayden wrote one of the prefaces. In that preface, he continues this theme of struggle, and he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This book is the story of one man's lifelong struggle against the odds, from the cradle onwards—the struggle to exist, to succeed as a human being, has never let up for Hughie Williams. Hughie has never stopped fighting. He is still fighting and he will be locked in combat when the muffled peal of the bell sounds, signifying the end, the last round in life's battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That bell did sound in October. Hughie Williams, at the age of 85, passed away from this life, and he left such an inspiration for all of us. You can see that he was a man who had a tough fight through his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the book, he talks about the grinding poverty that he and his family survived in the Hunter Valley during the Great Depression. This was a struggle that was shared by many people, but, in terms of Hughie's life, he watched his dad die as a result of lingering wounds from World War I. His mother could not cope with a large family living with no income—actually no income. The struggle of these kids, who were poor, going to school when they could and not having any kind of support in their lives, indicates that this grinding poverty stayed with Hughie his whole life. In fact, for those of us who knew him—a strong, vibrant leader—there was always a sense that he had a feeling of inferiority, which came from that period of being the subject of bullying and isolation because of the poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then find out that the man moved forward and took up two of the great loves of his life. Many people talk about the loves of Hughie's life. Certainly the trade union movement lived with him for most of his life, but I want to mention something that was really important in Hughie's life before that. It was described in the book as one of his greatest loves, and that was his wrestling career. I said that he talked about his struggle in sport, through many injuries, to represent Australia at the Olympics. He was a champion wrestler. Having been quite frail in childhood, the fact that he could actually take up this very tough sport and work tirelessly through his life to promote the sport and to engage other people in it was one of his lifelong legacies. Throughout his life, this attraction to physical exertion and competition was one of the driving forces. Indeed, he was competitive in wrestling for many years. He talked in the book about the fact that he missed out on selection in a number of Olympic trials but came very close to being selected. But he did get into the Olympic team for the Tokyo Olympics and won through to several bouts. He talks about the pride in finally getting the chance to represent his country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met Hughie Williams at the Paddington Workers Club in Brisbane. This was a centre for union and Labor activity in the area. As you walked through the front door of the Paddington Workers Club—which is still there, although not as strong as it was in the past—there was a large picture of Hughie in his wrestling gear, in all his finery. It was a remembrance of the spirit and the courage of the man to see the fact that he was such a strong sportsman. But when you moved past Hughie as the wrestler on the wall, you saw his engagement in the trade union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paddington Workers Club actually brought together two of the giants of the labour movement in Queensland: George Georges and Hughie Williams. Not long after I came to this place I had the chance to talk about George Georges, who had died at that time. Throughout their lives, Hughie and George provided mutual support for each other. Also, they were great inspiration and strength to anyone who was involved in the trade union movement and, in fact, the labour movement. I feel sure that while George was in this place—in the Senate, in the other Parliament House—he would have spoken about Hughie Williams at some stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hughie was a trade unionist from the time that he started work in the transport industry in the late sixties. He worked as a guard in one of the Mayne Nickless vans that delivered money around the areas. That was one of his first really long-term, full-time jobs. Then he became a delegate in the TWU. Then, from 1972, he worked in the trade union for over 30 years. He worked originally as an organiser and then, through a series of struggles, in the leadership of this union. In fact, for those of us in Queensland—and I think across Australia—you cannot think of the Transport Workers Union without thinking of Hughie Williams. He was a stalwart of that union and inspired an ongoing fight to ensure that workers in a very tough industry received the best possible support they could get from their union. His tactics were tough. He was a strong man. But there were many occasions when he was able to deliver for his unions and for his members and to ensure that they had the most effective safety. He was an absolute fighter in ensuring that the very dangerous work of transport drivers was acknowledged and that they were protected from the range of pressures in that industry. He fought strongly for safe work rates. I'm just sorry that he was not able to be with us here in this place when we finally got that legislation through. He was a hands-on unionist who believed that the best way to support your members was to be with them in the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to mention a couple of occasions that live with me always in my memories of Hughie. One was during the MUA dispute in 1998, when I looked down the road near the port in Brisbane and I saw the transport workers marching up towards that port during that very, very difficult dispute. Hughie led hundreds of his members to show support for the MUA in their struggle. I know that meant so much to the people on the ground. He then also provided support at night to ensure that the workers and their families had food and support as they went through those terrible months of dispute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will always remember Hughie Williams for the inspiration he gave to me and to other women in the trade union movement. He spent hours providing advice and suggestions to me when I was working in the trade union movement and when I had the opportunity to get the preselection to come to the Senate. I don't think Hughie thought very much of a lot of politicians, but he actually felt that there should be workers' representatives in parliament and he wanted to give them the best possible support that he could give. He was never short of providing advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Hughie's death was announced, a number of key leaders talked about what Hughie Williams meant to them. Anna Bligh said: 'Whenever Mr Williams found injustice, he struggled against it. He stood up for the people of Queensland. He called it for what it was.' Peter Beattie, who was a lifelong friend of Hughie's, said, 'He was a man with plenty of courage, plenty of guts and plenty of determination.' Kim Beazley said, 'Hughie is in fact the real deal, the authentic article, the man you need to know.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hughie has lost his final fight. He had a really tough last few years of his life when he was very unwell, but he remained so close to the people for whom he cared. He spoke many times about the love he had for his grandchildren in particular and for his family. His funeral at the beautiful Red Hill Catholic church in Brisbane reflected the strength of the man. As he left the church on his last journey, across the beautiful church, the Toreador Song rang out to remind us of what a man Hughie Williams was. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:30</span>):  As a senator for Queensland, it would be remiss of me not to alert people listening to this broadcast and to remind people in Queensland that we have a state election coming up on Saturday, 25 November. I think it's very important for Queenslanders to understand the significance of what is at stake in that forthcoming election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that today we learnt that Queensland is leading Australia when it comes to business confidence. In the NAB survey for the month of October, Queensland was once again the highest-rating state in Australia in terms of business confidence. For 32 of the last 34 months Queensland has been either at the top or second highest for business confidence. It's no wonder this is the case, because the Queensland government has been involved in creating 122,500 jobs since its election in January 2015, and that's of course a reflection of the stability of the Queensland government. When Labor were written off after the 2012 election, nobody gave us much of a chance of getting re-elected in 2015, but, against the odds, Annastacia Palaszczuk led the Labor team to a quite amazing victory. A lot has been achieved in that period of time, and there is therefore a lot at stake. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is concerning to note that there is an arrangement between the LNP and One Nation in Queensland in relation to preference deals. This was finally admitted on 10 November by Mr Nicholls, the leader of the LNP in Queensland, who many Queenslanders don't know very much about, which is a bit of an unfortunate situation. The LNP finally admitted that they would be giving preferences to One Nation in more than 50 of the state's 93 electorates. This is a very concerning development. This has only happened because Mr Nicholls knows that he can become Premier of Queensland only if he has the support of the One Nation party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a return of an LNP government would see a return of the savage cuts that were made to jobs and other worthwhile programs under the previous LNP government of Mr Newman and Mr Nicholls. We also know that One Nation has four former LNP MPs standing for election this time. All of those former LNP MPs gave Tim Nicholls glowing on-the-record endorsements when he made those savage cuts across Queensland and also proposed to sell public assets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very concerned about the fact that this alliance that seems to exist now between One Nation and the LNP is going to lead to some changes in the LNP policy. Does this mean that they're going to look at accommodating some of the One Nation approaches when it comes to anti-vaxxers? Does it mean a watering down of domestic violence laws, or perhaps looking at the GST review that Senator Hanson promised when she was in Western Australia? These are all things which would be detrimental to our state. We know that Senator Hanson's voting record in this place is that virtually 85 per cent of the time she supports the LNP, and this has led to the abolition of $2 billion in family payments and the handing of jobs to foreign workers on 457 visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With pre-polling having opened yesterday in Queensland, we know that cooperation has continued between the LNP and One Nation, and we know that, in the state seat of Lytton, One Nation volunteers are actually handing out LNP how-to-vote material. This just shows the extent of the alliance that now exists between the LNP and One Nation and the extent of the desperation on the part of the LNP to once again attain office in Queensland. This is something which I am very concerned about, and it puts at risk many of the achievements of the Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From my own perspective, some of the highlights of the Queensland government's record include, very early on, restoring the rights of injured workers to pursue common-law actions against their employer. This was something which was cruelly removed in Newman-Nicholls era of government. There was legislation for a new public holiday for Easter Sunday. We have recently seen the introduction of industrial manslaughter legislation. There was the introduction of licensing arrangements in respect of labour hire companies to try to address some of the concerns we have in that area. That is only a very small part of the record of the Labor government. Some of the more significant achievements that impact across the whole of the state are in the area of jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the areas of the economy which was amazingly neglected by former Premier Newman was the manufacturing sector. It did not rate when it came to the pillars of the economy that former Premier Newman envisaged. He completely neglected the manufacturing industry. I'm glad to say that our government has fixed that issue, and I am so proud of the fact that the government has acted to diversify our economy, to reach out to manufacturing and to strengthen the state's economy in that regard. One thing that was greeted very warmly was the decision that all future rail rolling stock and associated infrastructure—for which we have the manufacturing capacity in Queensland—will be manufactured and maintained by Queenslanders to support jobs in Maryborough and other regional centres. Under the previous, LNP government, the construction of trains was outsourced to India and jobs were lost as a result, and we're still dealing with the ongoing ramifications of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an eye-wateringly long list of Labor's commitments to manufacturing, which I won't go through, but it's extremely impressive. Some of the things being looked at include up to $30 million to establish manufacturing hubs to drive regional economies, initially in Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton, and continuing the 'buy Queensland' procurement policy. I wish I could spend half an hour talking about that. That is a very significant development to ensure that local manufacturers have the best opportunity to win government procurement contracts worth $14 billion. This may well cut across some of our free trade agreements, but the government has made clear its commitment to give priority to Queensland businesses. The Labor government is also looking at Defence jobs and setting up a dedicated agency to build on Queensland's strengths there. Time eludes me in relation to all of those issues, but there is so much at stake in this election that I think people need to be aware of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge some of the very hardworking Labor candidates who are out there at the moment with whom I have worked: Bart Mellish in Aspley, Chris Whiting in Bancroft, David Kerrigan in Gregory, Shane King in Kurwongbah, Ali King in Maiwar, Corrine McMillan in Mansfield, Steven Miles in Murrumba, Michael Hoogwaerts, who is doing a fantastic job in Pumicestone, Stirling Hinchliffe in Sandgate and Dr Anthony Lynham in Stafford. I am going to be getting around to some of our other candidates, such as Linus Power in Logan and Yvette D'Ath in Redcliffe, over the remaining days of the campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a great deal at stake in this forthcoming state election in Queensland. I think a lot of Queenslanders are in danger of not knowing about the track record of Tim Nicholls, a former Treasurer under the Campbell Newman government. They don't understand that Mr Nicholls was there under the Newman approach, standing silently by while all of that was happening, so it is incumbent on me to let people know that. I look forward to working with a re-elected Palaszczuk Labor government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DT6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  I note for the record again that this is not my first speech. I would like to also speak about the imminent state election happening in my home state of Queensland, a state election that offers the greatest chance Queenslanders have had in decades to fundamentally change politics for the better. Pre-poll voting is already open around the state for people in Queensland to be able to vote any day between now and the final official polling day on Saturday week, 25 October. There are Greens candidates standing in every single seat around the state. Every Queenslander has the opportunity to put the number 1 beside a Greens candidate and voice support for the vision and the policies that the Greens are putting forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to particularly focus on three seats that I have been campaigning in where, amongst a number of others, the Greens are poised to break through and be directly elected for the first time into Queensland parliament. Queensland is sometimes mistakenly perceived and portrayed as being a conservative state, even sometimes a reactionary state. Certainly it has had that strand of politics as part of its history. But it also has a proud history of being a radical state, a state that has been at the forefront of defending social justice, of putting forward a radical new vision that has delivered positive change for the people of Queensland on many occasions over the years. Many, many Queenslanders recognise that our current political system is badly broken. It needs a complete reworking and this is one of those times when it needs a strong new vision to really fix our broken political system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three seats I want to particularly focus on. Our candidates in those areas, all of whom I know very well and would personally vouch for, would be excellent representatives in the Queensland parliament to really shift the political direction of that state in a progressive direction. There is Michael Berkman for the seat of Maiwar, which is a new seat. The incumbent of that is an LNP former minister, Scott Emerson, who, as Senator Ketter has just mentioned, is on board, as his party is on board, with giving a massive leg up to the One Nation party to get back into Queensland parliament and create once again, no doubt, the shambles that my state experienced the last time they were in that parliament. The Liberal incumbent in the seat of Maiwar is on board with trying to get his party a hold on power by giving a leg up to One Nation. The only way that the Liberal National Party in Queensland can possibly hope to get anywhere near governing that state is by being beholden to One Nation and its agenda and values. By contrast, Michael Berkman has been a defender for the environment and for the interests of the community. He's been a public interest lawyer working pro bono in community legal centres to ensure that the community have a say in defending their environment, their values and their future. Maiwar is a new seat. Part of it was in the old Mount Coot-tha electorate where the current Labor environment minister was the incumbent. By contrast, he was so committed to his local community that, as soon as the new boundaries were announced, he departed for electorates far away which he thought would be a safer bet!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are committed to winning that seat off the LNP and really ensuring a strong antidote to any One Nation presence in the state parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to mention Kirsten Lovejoy, the candidate for the seat of McConnel, a local community activist of long standing who has been fighting against overdevelopment in that area, fighting against the massive increased pressure on local schools and transport because of the lack of investment in infrastructure in that area and the massive influence that developer donations have bought in that area, and fighting against the impact of the lockout laws in our CBD and our entertainment precincts that are having a really negative impact on the small venues, the small businesses and the artistic communities in Fortitude Valley and other areas. It is also an electorate where the state government has given over 10 per cent of public land to the massive development of Queen's Wharf casino—again, not coincidentally at all, to casino developers that have been major donors to both of the establishment political parties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to mention the seat of South Brisbane, where Amy McMahon is challenging and, as people would have seen in the media this week, running neck and neck with the Deputy Premier. It is a seat that is also notorious for appalling overdevelopment and development that has ignored the needs of community. There has not been adequate investment in local schools and in infrastructure to ensure that the community amenity is properly protected and community say in the future of their own communities is taken into account. We all know it's not taken into account, because of the pressure of developers. Developer donations are a key part of it, but it is not only developers; it is the resource lobby and the gambling lobby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The corporate dollars flowing into the coffers of the two parties of the establishment are a key part of why our political system is so broken. That is the key message that I've heard from doorknocking and calling people on the phone in all of those seats and, indeed, other parts of the state where I've also been supporting some of the other fabulous Greens candidates. I was in Ipswich last weekend and Toowoomba the weekend before that. In places such as Rockhampton, the Sunshine Coast and Cairns, the message is the same. The local issues may have a different twist to them sometimes, but the core message is that our political system is broken. We are at a crossroads, a time when we need to make that choice about how we fix that broken system. We can either pick the approach of the politics of division and fear that, as we've seen, people pick in other parts of the world or follow the approach that people like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn have put forward, of changing our politics so that it puts people first and makes politics work for everybody rather than just for the corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people say our political system is broken, what does that broken system actually look like? A broken system is where overdevelopment ignores the community, puts massive pressure on schools and on our infrastructure, and public investment is not provided, because the corporations and the mining companies are not paying their fair share. A broken system looks like big, wealthy for-profit property developers whose pursuit of profit has created a situation which has laid waste to the fundamental rights of Queenslanders to have a safe, secure and dignified home. It has property developers and investors who allow apartments and homes to sit idle, vacant and uninhabited, while right now 20,000 Queenslanders are homeless and 29,000 people are on the waiting list for housing. There are more vacant houses just in the city of Brisbane at this moment than there are homeless people across the whole state of Queensland looking for a home—somewhere to live, somewhere safe and affordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A broken political system looks like our government lining the back pockets of mining companies, who enjoy ridiculous royalty holidays, tax breaks and free access to water that should be made available to our farming communities, with zero accountability when they pack up, ship out and leave families and communities behind with the clean-up. A broken political system looks like electricity companies, who would rather pocket $7.2 billion in profits—that is up to 40 per cent of our current electricity bills in the last year—while 21,000 families across Queensland had their lights shut off because they couldn't afford to pay their power bill, the second highest rate of disconnections in Australia. Why is this? Why do we see people suffering at the hands of corporate greed? Because those corporations are buying influence from the two parties of the establishment and from the far Right parties, who all find it easier to ignore those they're elected to represent so that they can enjoy their positions of power and influence—the self-interest of the few, of the absolute elite and the political establishment, at the expense of the many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens say politics does not have to be this way. Indeed, the Greens say it is urgent that we put an end to politics as usual, and Queenslanders have an opportunity to put an end to politics as usual and really, seriously change politics for the better at this coming state election. The Greens say politics does not have to be held captive by the wealth of the few. Instead of reacting to this crisis by succumbing to false, doomed non-solutions of fear and division, which will only make things worse, it is clear there is a better way. Fear and greed do not stop corporations and politicians from being in bed together at the expense of the people they are meant to represent. The way to fix a broken system is to bring people together and put people back at the centre of politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have created a bold new vision for the people of Queensland with a range of policy initiatives that will effectively address the problems that are facing everyday Queenslanders today. They are fully costed and will be funded by simply taxing those who are currently not paying their fair share. The Greens say that, by fairly taxing the big end of town, all people can have a right to affordable, secure housing; to food; to affordable, reliable electricity; to upgraded schools and hospitals; and to better public transport and other social infrastructure. It is time to put people at the heart of politics and political decision-making and to put people before profits.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="269583" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GEORGIOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  A few weeks ago Pauline Hanson and I launched a new gas policy in Perth. It is aimed at benefiting Australians and ensuring that as a nation we get full value from the sale of our offshore gas. This all came about because, before becoming a senator back in March, I was shocked to learn that neither major political party have been willing to address the generous taxation regime which has resulted in Australians paying foreign-owned multinationals to take our gas and never pay for it. Before I go on, I do want to acknowledge that there is a lot of heavy investment in setting up shop. INPEX, for example, a Japanese-owned company, has invested billions of dollars in WA and in Darwin to produce a gas project which has a 40-year life span. That is all well and good and there have been thousands of jobs created in the construction phase, but where the situation gets ridiculous for me is the way oil and gas companies are allowed to treat expenses when calculating their profits. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next time you look at your gas or electricity bill, just remember this government allows petroleum and gas companies to claim more in expenses than they actually paid, which in effect represents a subsidy by the Australian taxpayer. Let me explain. These gas giants are able to claim 18 per cent more than what they pay for goods and services in the first year when calculating their income tax. If they don't make a claim then the expense of the previous year compounds at 18 per cent, year upon year, until it offsets income derived from production. But here is the kicker, Acting Deputy Speaker Leyonhjelm. A clutch of gas companies represented by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, APPEA, are sitting on $250 billion of Australian tax credits, which mean that these multinational companies will never pay income tax on the profits they make. The companies will, however, make billions of dollars from our gas, and those profits will find their way to some tax havens and to their shareholders. The Reserve Bank has suggested Australians buy shares in these companies if they want to benefit from Australian gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation has proposed changes to the tax regime which will see gas companies pay something for our gas. But these companies want to pay nothing and they are prepared to spend big to destroy anyone who suggests Australians should get something for their natural resources. Mining companies paid Western Australia $39 billion over the past decade, so what is wrong with One Nation's policy proposing a payment for WA's gas off the coast of Western Australia? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation proposes a uniform royalty of 10 per cent on the wellhead value of gas, which means these companies pay something for the gas they take. The proposal is vigorously opposed by the companies and their peak body, APPEA, which has accused One Nation of having anti-energy policies. APPEA says that a federal royalty, like the one on the North West Shelf, is a bad idea, comes at the worst possible time and will raise less tax than the petroleum resource rent tax. Only gas projects on the North West Shelf pay a royalty. All other fields pay absolutely nothing. I understand multinational gas companies would like to pay nothing for the gas they take and pay nothing on the profits they make by selling our gas, but this is not fair to all Australians as this gas is owned by all Australians. The budget papers show that, in 2017-18, the government expects to receive $800 million in tax for oil and gas, but most of this tax is related to the waters off Victoria and is paid by BHP. Nothing is paid for the gas taken off the coast of Western Australia, other than the North West Shelf, which makes us the biggest exporter of LNG in the world. The gas companies are willing to consider paying for our gas and want to discredit One Nation for suggesting they pay more than nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to royalties, One Nation wants a 'use it or lose it' policy applied to proven gas reserves, but companies with leases as old as 30 years say they want to hold onto them for as long as they want. The effect is to limit supply and drive up gas prices, which is what they accuse One Nation of doing. Our 'use it or lose it' policy would see more gas on the market and prices fall. Let it be clear and let's call out the elephant in the room: Australia faces a crisis because we do not have internationally competitive gas prices in the eastern states. The problem could be overcome with a pipeline from west to east or by shipping LNG to the East Coast and putting it into the eastern coast states' grids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AGL have already announced and are looking at floating a regassing platform in Victoria. We have abundant conventional gas off the West Coast of Australia and we have the right to benefit from it. Other countries have negotiated much better deals with multinational gas companies, and it is not too late for us to be paid for our gas. APPEA can huff and puff all they like, but One Nation is not giving in to their tactics. One Nation cannot be bought, and that presents a real problem for APPEA because that has worked well on so many other parties.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:58</span>):  Tomorrow, 15 November, is Palestinian National Day. It is the day that the state of Palestine was proclaimed in 1988. I'm moved to make this speech tonight not just because it is Palestinian National Day tomorrow; it also follows my visit to Palestine earlier this year, when I witnessed firsthand the struggles and the oppression of the Palestinian people by the government of Israel. I want to make this speech tonight having done my best to put myself in the shoes of others—in particular, the people of the Jewish faith. I know what a touchstone Israel is to Jewish people. The Jewish homeland is somewhere to be safe and cherished as a Jew after millennia of persecution. I can only try—and fail—to imagine what the prospect of settlement in Israel must have been like after the horrors of the Holocaust: having lost so many, having survived through unimaginable horrors, having been liberated from Nazi Europe, having been the sole survivor of one's family, having been rejected as refugees from around the world and then having to find a safe haven in Israel. I know many Jewish people in Melbourne who are the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors—my first serious boyfriend, my brother-in-law and many dear friends inside and outside the Greens and progressive movements. In fact, my university years in the early 1980s seemed filled with friends who had spent time in Israel, worked on kibbutzim and were committed to what they believed were socially progressive policies and a society that was developing in Israel. I remember hearing of Palestine around the same time and being confused. 'But Palestine doesn't exist, does it?' I thought. I thought that Palestine existed in biblical times. It wasn't part of modern-day geography. I knew vaguely that injustices were occurring but, hey, the Middle East was a complex, complicated place. And it was the Jews, wasn't it, who were the persecuted people? Story after story and novel after novel about the Holocaust confirmed that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a decade later that my sister lived in Palestine for a year, living and working in Nablus and Tulkarm, and that's when the issue of Palestine became real to me. That's when I properly began to realise that of course Palestine existed, that of course Palestinians existed, that the wars being fought—the conflicts, the attacks—were deeply rooted in the takeover of their land by Israelis and that the Israelis always came off best. They were stronger, more powerful, more supported by the international community. Yes, Palestinian terrorist attacks would take Israeli lives and were to be condemned, but the provocation and the reprisals were always a magnitude more extreme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I facilitated the development of the Greens policy on Israel and Palestine in the early 2000s. It calls for recognition of Palestine, an end to the occupation and an end to the settlements that are illegal under international law. It also calls for a two-state solution based on the 1967 border. It condemns violence from both sides. I still think that facilitating that policy and reaching consensus on that policy was one of the most significant facilitation tasks I've ever done. It has stood the test of time, but, sadly, it's increasingly aspirational. In the 15 years since, the prospect of a two-state solution is further away than ever. Settlements have become entrenched, and this year has marked 50 years of military occupation of the West Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Palestine has stayed a touchstone issue for the Greens. We know that there are many Jewish people, including Jewish members, who think our position is too pro-Palestinian, doesn't sufficiently recognise the importance of Israel to Jewish people and doesn't acknowledge sufficiently the threat to Israel's existence from hostile forces. They think that we focus too much on Palestine. 'There are so many other places in the world where human rights are being abused. Why just pick on Israel?' the argument goes. Then, equally, there are probably more people who are deeply moved by the ongoing, deep injustices being wrought upon innocent people—aided and abetted by Australia and the US in particular. Those people think that we, as Greens, should be speaking out much more, taking much more strident action, and supporting and calling for much greater action against the Israeli government, including through boycotts, divestment and sanctions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the context in which I visited Israel and Palestine for the first time earlier this year. I've previously spoken in the Senate about this trip briefly but not at length. So this speech tonight is topical not just because of Palestinian national day tomorrow but because of our Prime Minister's recent trip to Israel and Palestine. I was saddened and angered by the insensitivity of our Prime Minister—my representative—to the plight of Palestinian people on his trip and by his kowtowing to and his appeasement of the Israeli government in the appalling human rights abuses that they are meting out to innocent people. The twisting of the significance of the Battle of Beersheba was another prompt, as was the 100-year anniversary of the signing of the Balfour Declaration just two weeks ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the main driver for me making this speech tonight, some six months after my trip, is that what I experienced in Palestine has stayed with me. Once seen, once experienced, it is never forgotten. I've sought out more knowledge and information since my return, and the plight of the Palestinian people is literally keeping me awake at night. My trip was organised by the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, and I'm pleased to see that there has recently been another APAN trip. This time some of my Labor Party colleagues attended, including senators Claire Moore and Anne Urquhart, who are both here in the chamber at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When looking at Israel and Palestine and thinking about why I'm speaking here tonight, I mentioned Beersheba and the Balfour Declaration, because history matters when you are looking at the current-day Israel and Palestine. From the Palestinian perspective, it is their land and their homes. From a Jewish perspective, the claim is that historical ties and religious traditions link Jewish people to the land of Israel. But, from that historical perspective, we then move to the 1948 Palestinian war where, with international support, the Nakba, the catastrophe, occurred when 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, and 80 per cent of the Arab inhabitants of what became Israel left or were expelled. Then we jump forward to the 1967 war, when a further 300,000 Palestinians fled the West Bank and the military occupation of the so-called Palestinian Territories began—50 full years ago. Since then we've had ongoing wars, skirmishes and peace talks, and everyone seems to have ended up with more areas being designated as Israeli and smaller and smaller areas being in Palestinian control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to give a historical treatise here tonight or try to say what might have been different if different actions had been taken; I just want to set the context of why. When I was in Israel and Palestine we spoke to many people. We spoke to Israelis and Palestinians and people who were working to end the illegal military occupation of Palestine and to remove the illegal Israeli settlements. We spoke to the Israeli human rights organisation, B'Tselem. We spoke to the New Israel Fund and to Gerard Horton, an Australian lawyer, who heads up Military Court Watch, which has a focus on trying to get justice for Palestinian children who are being imprisoned and trying to make sure that even what is set out in Israeli law is actually being followed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We observed the massive impact of the military occupation of the West Bank—the huge military presence; the illegal Israeli settlements; the massive number of homes that are being demolished; the huge number of arrests of children and adults; the harassment, the violence and the control; and the jailing of Palestinian children. I took the opportunity to be the first Australian federal parliamentarian to visit one of the Israeli military courts, the Ofer military court, which is near Jerusalem. There had been no Australian federal politician—not even a diplomat—who had visited these courts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met some of the families of the children who had been arrested and were serving time in jail. In fact, I met with a number of mothers of children who were there, waiting for the trials of their 12- or 14-year-olds, and they described to me the process that they were going through. They'd been there since six o'clock in the morning, because they were not given any particular time when their child's trial was going to be heard. Sometimes if the weather was bad they would have to wait out in the boiling sun or the pouring rain because of inadequate facilities for the families. We talked to mothers—there were about half a dozen of them the morning we were there—and we heard the same story from each of them. They told us of their teenage sons being arrested at gunpoint at about two o'clock in the morning and the arrests occurring with 10 to 15 Israeli soldiers bashing down the doors of their home, coming into the house with their machine guns pointed at all members of the family and saying that they were going to arrest this young person. In many circumstances, they told us, they were not even told what this young person was being charged with. One of them said that all they were told at that stage was that he was a troublemaker, and she told us that she was admonished: 'Why don't you stop your son being a troublemaker?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What then happens is that, given half a chance, these soldiers drag off this 12- or 14-year-old in their pyjamas. Often the parents have to struggle to even get their child properly dressed before they are dragged away in the middle of the night. They are then taken off, often in very violent ways, in the back of a truck to be taken into detention. The two charges that we heard about them being charged with were throwing stones or incitement on Facebook. They were being charged with putting a comment on social media that was critical of the repressive regime that the Israeli government was keeping them under—of the oppressive military occupation that is recognised internationally as needing to end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We attempted to attend one of the trials of one of those teenagers, but we were barred from doing so, even though Israeli standing orders for the trials say that, if there's support from the family, the trials of juveniles can be open and observers can be present. But the judge said no. It was his ruling that, because it was a juvenile, we weren't to be there, so we were barred from attending his trial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did, however, manage to attend the trial of a 23-year-old. The story of this 23-year-old is typical of the stories of what young people in Palestine are up against. He had already served six months in prison, and his six months had been served because of incitement on Facebook. He'd served his time and had managed to get back to his studies and do his exams—he was studying accounting at a local university. Then he was arrested again, and the charge this time was that he had been talking to some friends. He was not even accused of leading the conversation. He was just talking to some friends who, it was alleged, had been talking about acquiring weapons. That was enough for him to be arrested again, in the middle of the night, and taken off to prison, and he was now there shackled in the military court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the fact that we were there at the court hearing actually had a significant bearing on the trial. We heard that the Israeli military courts have a 99.7 per cent prosecution rate. That is because, if you're a 14-year-old or a 23-year-old who is being accused of something like incitement on Facebook, you're encouraged to plead guilty. If you plead guilty, you're likely to get a prison term of three to four months, but, if you don't plead guilty and you contest the charge, you're likely to be in detention for over six months. But we were there, and the judge, I think, knew that there were observers in that courtroom, and there was what seemed to be a blue-moon miracle—that 0.03 per cent of circumstances where the charges are dismissed. The family was extremely happy about our presence there as observers in that military court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the context as to why it's important for observers to be present and why other countries, but not Australia, send observers to be present—to let the Israeli government know that the world is listening and that their human rights abuses and complete abrogation of international law are being seen and being watched. This is something that Australia can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ongoing harassment of young people by this military state is doing its job. The Israeli military forces are very good at picking out any young person who shows any leadership, who is showing that sense of not wanting to just acquiesce to the military occupation that they are under. With anyone who is identified like that, the military forces will find the opportunity to arrest them very early on and let them know that it's not worth protesting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We of course observed the illegal settlements—the Jewish settlements that are illegal under international law that are spreading across the West Bank. The expansion of these settlements has continued in the six months since I was there. In fact, in the last month there have been more settlements approved by the Israeli government, including settlements in Hebron and in Jerusalem, in extremely contested Palestinian neighbourhoods. Of course, with these settlements come the roads that connect up the settlements—the apartheid roads that are only open to the Jewish inhabitants of the settlements. The Palestinians who live in surrounding villages aren't allowed to use them. There is a separation of people, with more and more areas off limits to Palestinians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We visited Hebron and the sterilised Shuhada Street, which used to be the main street of Hebron and is now closed to Palestinian people, and the checkpoints. Palestinians living in Hebron cannot get around their own town. We met the activist Issa Amro, who is fighting for Palestinians to be able to continue to live in and access their home of Hebron. He is now on trial for his activism. We saw the separation wall—the wall that is set up to divide Palestinians from land that the Israelis want to have control over; the wall that cuts people off from their agricultural land if they live in villages and cuts them off from their work if they are going to access work on the Israeli side of the wall. We saw the checkpoints that they have to be corralled through. This is all about control. It's all keeping people under military occupation and making life as difficult as possible. We didn't get to Gaza. Nobody gets to go to Gaza. Nobody is allowed in, so we could only imagine the horrors that are unfolding in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of the very strongest allies of Israel in the world. So, as one of Israel's very best friends in the world, we are in a position where we can do what other nations can't: we can be honest with our best friends and tell them, when they're doing something that is not appropriate, that it should cease. I think it's of critical importance that our diplomats take up that opportunity. Our Prime Minister, when he visited, should have taken up that opportunity. It's something that we can do to keep the pressure on Israel, to tell them that they have to be true and serious about their expressed intent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state of Israel says that they support a two-state solution. My visit to Israel and Palestine, and everything I have learnt since, shows me that the only way to get Israel to the negotiating table and seriously negotiating for a two-state solution is through international pressure, and Australia has a critical role to play in that international pressure. We should recognise Palestine as an independent state and join the majority of countries in the world that have done so. It's a particularly important thing to be calling for on the eve of Palestinian National Day tomorrow. We should be calling for an end to the illegal settlements, not just saying, 'Oh well, they're there,' and just acquiescing. We should be calling for an end to the 50-year military occupation of the West Bank. We shouldn't be co-operating with military sales and military agreements. I'm horrified to think about what this government has been talking about in recent months: increasing military ties and increasing military sales with Israel—connecting Australia with the horrors of the military might of Israel. But, above all, we as Greens are asking that Australia be critical publicly, not just in private conversations. Israel has to know that we are watching, that we care and that human rights matter to us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:17</span>):  In recent weeks I have met with representatives and supporters of some of the diverse communities that are active in Sydney. Tonight I will share with the Senate the information I have been provided with. These reports are deeply shocking, highlighting the brutality of colonialism and the tragic consequences of war and oppression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Yemen right now. After 2½ years of war, a severe blockade is stopping crucial supplies from reaching desperate people. I'm speaking about this in the Senate because the Australian government is deeply complicit, through weapons exports to Saudi Arabia. First, I will detail the suffering that is occurring. Rathwan Alasbahi needs a kidney transplant. He is forty years old and he urgently needs a kidney transplant. The ABC's Sophie McNeill has reported that the hospitals in Yemen, because of the blockade and the war, can no longer perform transplants. Due to the blockade, Rathwan cannot leave the country to get a transplant either. What a shocking situation for him to be in and for his family to watch. The Yemeni ministry of health estimated that, even before these new measures, 10,000 patients died in the past year waiting for medical care—10,000 in one year because there was not sufficient medical care. That figure alone is shocking and should be a wake-up call for us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The blockade is affecting the most basic of human needs: food. On 8 November, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, commented on the tightening of the blockade. These were his words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have told the Council that unless those measures are lifted and five particular steps that I am going to run through are taken, there will be famine in Yemen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It will not be like the famine that we saw in South Sudan earlier in the year where tens of thousands of people were affected. It will not be like the famine which cost 250,000 people their lives in Somalia in 2011. It will be the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a quote from a UN representative identifying that millions of people in Yemen will die if the blockade is not lifted. Twenty-three humanitarian organisations, including Care, Oxfam, Save the Children and the UN, have issued a joint statement on the blockade restricting aid supplies. This is from their statement:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are over 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance; seven million of them are facing famine-like conditions and rely completely on food aid to survive. In six weeks, the food supplies to feed them will be exhausted. Over 2.2 million children are malnourished, of those, 385,000 children suffer from severe malnutrition and require therapeutic treatment to stay alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The current stock of vaccines in country will only last one month. If it is not replenished, outbreaks of communicable diseases such as polio and measles are to be expected with fatal consequences…</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's from the statement of 23 humanitarian organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where does Australia stand? Australia is complicit in this suffering through its cooperation with Saudi Arabia. 'Cooperation' is probably too kind a word. Australia is actually bragging about its arms sales with Saudi Arabia as this war intensifies. On 30 October this year, Minister Christopher Pyne announced he would be visiting Saudi Arabia. These were Mr Pyne's words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… to promote Australia's world-class defence materiel and strengthen bilateral defence industry relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And in Saudi Arabia he would—and these are his words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…meet with senior government representatives to discuss the bilateral defence industry relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, we all know that the people of Yemen are dying. Even though there's not much publicity, I think we all know that something shocking has happened there. And Australia is spruiking arms that kill these people! That's what is going on in this part of the world—Saudi Arabia is permitting terrible crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't actually know the arms trade or value of the trade Australia is engaging in with Saudi Arabia. Despite a motion from former Greens senator Scott Ludlam which called on the government to provide details, the government is continuing to hide what is being sold to Saudi Arabia. But we know it is being sold. At the very least, the Australian people deserve to know that Australia is complicit in this war, which is driving the famine. When you're spending money on war and when you're waging war, however it plays out it costs lives. The global community needs to place an arms embargo on parties to the conflict. The way we profit from the misery of the people in Yemen is a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred years ago, Britain, responsible for so much death and destruction in its colonial zeal, sowed the seeds of Palestinian dispossession of the Nakba, the impact of which is still being felt by everyone living inside the borders of historic Palestine and around the world. The Balfour Declaration, delivered to Lord Rothschild of the British Zionist Federation 100 years ago, was a moment in history that is still unbelievable. As Israeli journalist Gideon Levy wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There was never anything like it: an empire promising a land that it had not yet conquered to a people not living there, without asking the inhabitants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historians, such as Ilan Pappe, have shown that the Zionist leaders understood 'the promise' meant the country as a whole. This also meant that the Zionist leaders had no intention of honouring the partition plan, which was also a violation of the rights of Palestinian people. From the moment Lord Balfour penned those 67 words to the implementation of Ben-Gurion's Plan D, which started the 'ethnic cleansing' of the land of Palestine, the intention of the Zionist leaders was to colonise the whole of Palestine. Today 78 per cent of historic Palestine is colonised and the remaining 22 per cent is under Israeli occupation. Today there are over nine million Palestinians living as second-class citizens inside Israeli borders, under military occupation in the Gaza Strip and West Bank or living as refugees in surrounding Arab countries and in the wider diaspora. All of these Palestinians have been personally impacted by the violent dispossession of their homes and lands that began in 1948, and none have been granted the right of return. If you are Palestinian, you can't return to your land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decades of human rights violations, war crimes and deaths on all sides can all be attributed to the arrogance of the colonial British at the hand of Lord Arthur Balfour. This year, the Palestinian people called on the British government to recognise and apologise for the 100 years of destruction and dispossession instigated by the declaration. It is unfortunate that not only did Britain fail to recognise their hand in the Palestinian Nakba but also British Prime Minister Theresa May attended a gala dinner celebrating the declaration, saying that Britain is 'proud of her pioneering role in the creation of the State of Israel'. The centenary came and went without an apology from Britain. But that should come as no surprise. The lack of recognition of the genocide that was perpetrated by British colonisers on this land and indeed around the world in so many other countries still remains unrecognised. Talking of a resolution between Israel and Palestine, or indeed talking of recognition in this country, without first recognising the history and cause of the problem can never result in a just peace—and surely peace with justice should be the starting point for any negotiations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kurds of the Middle East have common ethnicity, language and identity, but their land flows across four modern state boundaries—Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. For centuries the Kurds have struggled for recognition and autonomy and repeatedly this has been denied in the wider geopolitical struggles in the region. Again and again the Kurds have assisted in the overthrow of oppressors, in defeating the Ottomans and most recently in defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Despite promises of recognition, history is littered with broken promises to the Kurds; in fact, they continue to be oppressed by the nation states in which they are embedded, being denied citizens' rights. Considering the level of abuse, it is no wonder that the Kurds in Turkey at least have resorted to violent military action in defence of their rights. Their recognised leader, Ocalan, has been jailed for many years. Only mutual negotiation and recognition can solve this running sore. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kurds, as we know, have no homeland state of their own. In each country they live in they form a sizeable minority and in each country except Iran they have struggled for autonomy for centuries. Such has been the fate of Kurdish people for millennia—constantly being attacked, massacred or deported. In each case the dominant rulers of the state have frequently refused to acknowledge the Kurds as citizens and denied them basic rights. In Turkey, Kurds account for 18 per cent or more of the population, mainly in the east and the south of the country. Following the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey denied the very existence of Kurds and any expression of ethnic identity by the Kurds was harshly repressed. The use of Kurdish language was repressed, especially in state schools. Sadly, these practices continue across different countries where Kurdish people now live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Human Rights Watch have documented many instances where the Turkish military forcibly destroyed houses and villages. Three thousand villages were virtually wiped off the map and it displaced more than 378,000 people. The struggle continues to this day, greatly increased since the failed coup and autocratic rule of Erdogan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PKK is a Kurdish militant organisation which has waged an arms struggle against the Turkish state for cultural and political rights and self-determination for the Kurds. The PKK has been labelled a terrorist organisation by Turkey's allies, including the US and the European Union, but, interestingly, not by the United Nations, Switzerland or Russia. To this day, the Kurds remain the largest group of stateless people on this planet. Many feel far more kinship with their fellow Kurds in Iran, Iraq and Syria than with their nominally country folk in Turkey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Iraq, Kurds make up around 17 per cent of the population and form the semi-autonomous state of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yet, between 1975 and 1978, 200,000 Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq. During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Iraqi forces were responsible for the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the destruction of 2,000 Kurdish villages. Most recently, the Iraqi Kurds held a referendum resulting in an overwhelming vote for autonomy. However, the Iraqi government quickly moved into Kirkuk, regaining political control and reclaiming the rich oil fields of Kirkuk. Many thousands of civilians fled towards the northern border with Turkey fearing further retribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Syria, Kurds make up approximately 10 per cent of the population, living mainly in the north. In some areas, the Kurdish language is banned. As well, in some areas children cannot be registered with Kurdish names. Around 300,000 Kurds have been denied Syrian nationality and any social rights, yet Kurdish militias in Syria, in support of US forces, were the only ground forces that so far have managed to take on ISIS and win. The Americans supported the Kurds when it suited them, but then refused to support their bid for autonomy. The Turkish government has long feared Kurdish independence outside its borders lest it provoke similar aspirations inside Turkey. Thus, Turkey felt threatened when Iraqi Kurds held and won a referendum for independence and threatened potentially crippling restrictions on oil trading, and have even have threatened to invade Iraqi Kurdistan. In Syria, rather than supporting the Kurdish militias fighting ISIS, Turkey has actively attacked Kurdish regions in northern Syria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Turkish Kurds, the double standards are extreme and discriminatory—that's what they have to endure. Kurdish fighters were celebrated around the world in 2014-15 as they withstood a month-long siege by the Islamic State but were then ignored in their own struggle for human rights. Kurds quite rightly condemn as hypocrisy the US policy of supporting Kurds when fighting for their rights against ISIS but not when doing the same against Turkey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abdullah Ocalan has achieved a status among Kurds much like that of Nelson Mandela. He's also been jailed for a very long time. Ocalan is a political theorist who first pursued a Marxist national liberation struggle uniting the Kurds across four countries: Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. He co-founded the PKK in 1978 and led the movement in a protracted guerrilla resistance in the 1980s and 1990s. He was captured in 1999. Ocalan has developed the theory of loosely federated Kurdish communities that would not necessarily cause the break-up of Turkey's national territory. I give emphasis to that because the Kurdish, in their negotiations and in their campaigns, are being very practical in terms of the current situation, where there are now four nation states, and are trying to work within that to advance their rights for some level of autonomy in that area. Ocalan has become a symbol of struggle that crosses many of the divides in Kurdish national politics. While there are large differences among Kurdish national movements, Ocalan is supported by many Kurdish groups. For the PKK, real negotiations can only begin when Ocalan is released from his island prison and leads the Kurds at the negotiating table for greater autonomy, peace and cultural rights. Thank you, Mr President.</span>
