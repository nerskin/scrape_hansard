            </a>  Madam Speaker, I respect what the minister has said—that he arrived after the proceedings had started but was here during them. The significance of a member of the executive being present at all times, as you would appreciate, is quite fundamental. It would be appreciated if the appropriate communications could take place between you and the executive for the efficient running of the parliament. That rule is there for a very significant reason—one that advantages the parliament and, indeed, the government—and I would just ask that appropriate process be followed.</span>

            <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The minister will resume his seat. The fact of the matter is that the standing orders do in fact require certain things to occur. I have spoken about that already. The Manager of Opposition Business has made a request of me, which was a reasonable request to make in the circumstances. However, I do concede that some activity might be anticipated this morning by the attendance on the opposition side which is not normal at the opening of proceedings. It is very nice to have so many present. I can only say that I think we saw a bit of game playing this morning. Nonetheless, the rules are the rules.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are most important matters which do need to be debated by the House. We have seen chronic underperformance in the Defence portfolio since this government was elected. We have seen this government systemically undermine security by trashing confidence in our platforms and capacity; undermine the reputation of Australian industry and the economy more widely; and destroy the morale of the Royal Australian Navy and their confidence in their ships and submarines. </span>

It is—not that the government would care about it—a shocking insult to the thousands of Australian men and women working at the Australian Submarine Corporation. Indeed, this is part of the consistent record of incompetence and intemperance that we see from this minister. Does the defence minister still have the Prime Minister's confidence?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion should be debated. After the defence minister's bombshell yesterday, where he trashed the reputation of our submarine builder, we saw the Prime Minister last night issue a startling repudiation of the Minister for Defence's comments. But does this hapless defence minister realise the hot water he is in? Not at all. That reflects his general lack of awareness of his portfolio. But this morning the opposition are saying: if the government want to draw a line under this Defence confusion, this melee, then the Prime Minister should come in and simply say those magic words which every minister on the ropes, every minister cut adrift, has desperately wanted to hear from their leader: 'I have full confidence in the minister.' There is deafening silence. The Minister for Defence has been abandoned by his government—but there are good reasons why the Minister for Defence should be abandoned by his government. </span>

There has been no progress on the Land 400 project to replace our armoured vehicles. The SEA 1000 Future Submarine is an absolute debacle, where we see decisions made about where we spend billions of dollars—</span>

We have given them the opportunity today for the Prime Minister to come into this chamber and decide whether or not they have a defence minister worth defending. One by one, they have all lined up and said, 'No'. They would rather not have the debate. They would rather not have the discussion or be forced into a situation where someone on that side has to claim, 'We have a fit and proper person in the Defence portfolio.' Last night, the Prime Minister of Australia hung his own defence minister out to dry. We had the member for Mayo going out as a member of the executive, completely disowning the comments of the Minister for Defence. We have Senator Birmingham completely disowning the comments of the Minister for Defence. We have the Prime Minister, in a statement, distancing himself from it. This is now a test of leadership for the Prime Minister of Australia. Either he backs his defence minister or he backs his federal Liberal MPs. The Prime Minister, if he has no confidence in the defence minister, should accept the challenge to get rid of his defence minister. </span>

The Prime Minister should be called into the chamber now.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ROBERT:</span>
                  </a>  If there was ever a shiny example of a whitewashed tomb and hypocrisy, it is this. Not content with handing over to our government a situation where $16 billion was ripped out of Defence, the Labor Party had a revolving door of three Defence ministers. The first one Labor took into power was described as an electrician in a suit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not content with taking levels of Defence funding as a proportion of GDP to levels not seen since 1938, not content with reducing project-spending capability—the Labor Party impacted 46 per cent of all projects through their cuts—and not content with having 14 ministerial reshuffles over their six moribund years in parliament, the Labor Party comes in this morning to cry foul. Seriously, are you kidding the nation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legacy that Labor left when it comes to defence should have their heads hanging in shame. A 2009 white paper went completely and utterly unfunded. Capability was thrown to the winds. At the height of what the Labor Party was doing in Defence, capability spending as a proportion of the total budget was a mere 18 per cent. That is absolutely and utterly appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the party that decided to cut counter-IED phase 2 funding whilst we were doing combat operations in Afghanistan. And this party has the hide, the temerity and the audacity to come in and lecture this government about how defence is done. This is the first year in seven years when Defence funding has been stable—$3.9 billion more in Defence funding has been provided, in macro terms, this year than the previous year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence funding as a proportion of GDP is 1.8 per cent this year. What was it under the Labor Party? It was 1.56 per cent—the lowest level since 1938. I do not think that any of those opposite were born prior to 1938, which means that there is no-one on the other side that has seen Defence funding drop to such a low level under their watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that as a background—as a history; as a stinking, rotten carcase sitting over the shoulders of the Labor Party—they walk in here and have the temerity to lecture this government on exactly how defence should be managed. Let's look through the history of exactly what the Labor Party did in government. The then Prime Minister—the ultimate minister when it comes to national security—Prime Minister Gillard, could not be bothered attending the National Security Committee of cabinet. Who did she send? She sent her bodyguard. That is how the Labor Party treats defence. Their Prime Minister sent her bodyguard along to the National Security Committee of cabinet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did Prime Minister Rudd do? Let's look at the consistency of the Labor Party. Prime Minister Rudd sent an adviser to the National Security Committee of cabinet. That is the extent to which the Labor Party treats the National Security Committee. It is simply extraordinary.</span>

                  </a>  He has been extraordinarily honest in terms of his comments. We all know that the submarine process has at least six months to go. Why does it still have six months to go? Because for six, long, horrid, wintry years, the Labor Party made zero decisions on submarines. Zero decisions were made on our submarine capability—to the point where we are facing a very real capability gap. The Labor Party refused to make a call on the next generation submarine and now demand that we as a government clean up all of their mistakes. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. It is no wonder we were forced to shut down the Leader of the Opposition. Not even his own side could sit quietly and believe what he had to say. It is extraordinary.</span>

As members will be aware, the existing security arrangements for Parliament House have been enhanced and strengthened over the past few weeks, following the national terrorism public alert level being raised from medium to high. As I have said before in this House, the security arrangements in the parliamentary precincts are under continual and careful assessment, and I am working closely with a range of departments including security and intelligence agencies, in carrying out the necessary security works within the parliamentary precinct. </span>

We have also increased the armed presence guarding our parliament, which now includes long armed weapons. Whilst we have taken the necessary steps on security early, building occupants will notice significant building security works being undertaken in the weeks and months ahead. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the physical security enhancements, we have been reviewing the governance arrangements for security matters within Parliament House. This bill seeks to further strengthen those governance arrangements in two important areas.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, this bill will enable a representative of the Australian Federal Police to be a full member of the Security Management Board, a board which is established under section 65A of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999. This Board provides advice to the presiding officers as required, on security policy and the management of security measures, for Parliament House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other members of the board include representatives from the Department of the House of Representatives, the Department of Parliamentary Services, and the Department of the Senate. The function of the board is to provide advice to the presiding officers on a range of security measures, and having the Australian Federal Police as a member of the board will boost the board's capability and reach on security matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill will amend the remit of the board, which is set out in subsection 65A(5) of the act, to allow the board to provide advice to the presiding officers on the management or operation of security measures for Parliament House. This will mean that the board may provide a wide range of advice to the presiding officers on both short-term and long-term security matters. </span>
                </p>

                    </a>  by leave—I rise to speak on the tabling of the 16th report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights to the 44th Parliament. The committee considered 15 bills. Of these, four do not require further scrutiny as they are compatible with human rights. The committee has decided to further defer its consideration of eight bills. The committee has identified three bills that it considers require further examination and for which it will seek further information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the bills considered, those which are scheduled for debate during the sitting week commencing 24 November include the Broadcasting and Other Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014, the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Amendment bill 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report outlines the committee's assessment of the compatibility of these bills with human rights. I encourage my fellow members to the look to the committee's report to inform their deliberations on the merits of the proposed legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make some remarks to remind members of the context in which the committee undertakes its task of assessing legislation on compatibility with human rights. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, or PJC, is one of only three legislative scrutiny committees established or administered by the Senate. It is sometimes forgotten that legislative scrutiny committees perform a unique and important institutional role in the parliament, which is to undertake technical—and I stress that—assessments of bills and legislation against scrutiny criteria or, in the case of the PJC, establish human rights standards. Those points are extremely important to bear in mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This unique function of scrutiny committees has always been reflected in the bipartisan spirit in which they operate. With this bipartisan approach and with the support of well-respected external legal advisers, the scrutiny committees' reports have been trusted and credible sources of information since the establishment of the parliament's first scrutiny committee, the regulation and ordinances committee, in the 1930s.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting the many opportunities that exist for members of parliament to engage in the robust party and political debates that are a familiar feature of our parliament, the scrutiny committees therefore provide a balanced and objective source of information to educate and inform parliamentarians. However, if scrutiny work is not to have the character of contest that we are also familiar with in this chamber, what is the role of a scrutiny committee member if not to prosecute the case on the merits of policy? The answer to that, I believe, is that the role of scrutiny committee members has been and is to ensure that scrutiny committee reports are legally and technically credible as well as consistent with past practice. That is naturally done at meetings through testing and questioning of the issues and through the analysis provided in the committees' reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members also contribute to directing the tone and nature of the committees' dialogue with ministers and to shaping the committees' actions in cases where legislation may offend a relevant scrutiny principle. Hundreds of parliamentarians have served on the parliament scrutiny committees and have conscientiously worked within the constraints of the scrutiny approach to serve the parliament's ethos of informed inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is equally important to note that scrutiny committee members are not and have never been bound by the contents and inclusion of scrutiny committee reports. They are obviously free to otherwise engage in debates over the policy merits of legislation according to the dictates of party conscience, belief, outlook or even prejudice, as the case may be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scrutiny committee members may also legitimately apply the technical knowledge gleaned from their service as scrutiny committee members to mount arguments outside the technical scrutiny arena. Clearly involvement in the scrutiny dialogues enhances members' technical knowledge of legislation and enhances their capacity to prosecute their own views with reference to established and well-known principles, be they of a human rights or parliamentary variety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I therefore encourage members who may not have yet performed service on a scrutiny committee to consider, understand and appreciate the distinct character of scrutiny committees and the particular benefits they provide in relation to not only informing debates in this place but also the broader ability of members to engage in informed and principled debate on the merits of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn very briefly to the minority report in this particular case. The committee concluded that one piece of legislation looked at in this report infringed upon privacy, equality and non-discriminatory rights in this country. I note that the minister declined to answer questions in regards to proportionality. I note that it was said that the person who would in future have to have all of their previous names on the back of their citizenship form controlled that document. That is clearly not the case because employers can ask for access to that document.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly say that in a week where we all in this parliament were running around wearing a white ribbon the particular provision that in future people would have all of their various names listed on the back of a citizenship form could create a situation for people who have chosen to change their name because of very dire domestic violence histories. We could have situations where people have changed their gender. We could have situations where people have changed their name because in parts of the world their name would identify them as a particular ethnic or religious group. Cases that come to mind very quickly are the Tutsis and Hutus from Rwanda; different tribes in South Sudan, where there is conflict; and Christians and Muslims—and different types of Muslims—in the Middle East, northern Nigeria or Afghanistan. People might not travel on passports. They might choose to have these documents as a form of identification in those countries when they visit them. They may have changed their names to avoid being identified, and yet they could be identified, pulled off a bus and shot dead—by the Taliban, for instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very serious matter of proportionality in this. It would be extremely dangerous for this country to allow an extension of people's private information to documents such as this, especially when the case has not been made that this would fundamentally aid the alleged campaign to reduce fraud. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  Labor welcomes the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014. The bill amends the Australian War Memorial Act to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian War Memorial is located in my electorate and combines a shrine, a world-class museum and an extensive archive. The memorial's purpose is to commemorate the sacrifice of those Australians who have died in war. Its mission is to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this mission, the Australian War Memorial offers, on a fee-for-service basis, a number of additional services such as venue hire and educational and school holiday programs. The fees from these services contribute to the funding of the Australian War Memorial. These services will not be affected by the amendments in the bill that prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell. The Australian War Memorial will continue to provide, and charge a fee for, these additional services. The amendments in the bill will also not prevent the Australian War Memorial from receiving voluntary donations at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the aftermath of the Battle of Pozieres in 1916, Australia's official war historian Charles Bean began to develop plans for a national memorial to commemorate the sacrifices made by his fellow Australians. He felt it was important for such a memorial to include an extensive military collection in order to help Australians at home understand the wartime experience. In the words of Charles Bean:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It had always been in the mind of many Australians soldiers that records and relics of their fighting would be preserved in some institutions in Australia, and to several of us it had seemed that a museum housing these would form the most natural, interesting, and inspiring memorial to those who fell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the War Memorial commemorates the sacrifice of Australians who have died in war. It helps Australians remember and understand through maintaining the Roll of Honour and conducting national commemorative ceremonies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day the memorial holds national ceremonies on the Parade Ground. These are attended by thousands of official guests and visitors, and are followed by the wreathlaying at the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. Official visitors to the memorial usually pay tribute to Australia's war dead by laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier or at the Inauguration Stone. School groups and veterans' groups also conduct commemorative wreathlaying ceremonies in these areas. The War Memorial's main building and grounds are conserved and developed as a national memorial to Australians who served and died at war. As well as the Commemorative Courtyard, the Sculpture Garden provides another dignified and attractive focus for commemoration within the memorial grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of the grounds, I cannot help recounting a story of one of my constituents, Gerry, who served in Vietnam. His tank was placed in the War Memorial grounds. While on service in Vietnam his unit had written on the side of the tank, and he went back to show his wife the graffiti that they had placed on the side of the tank. Overhearing this conversation, one of the local guards was shocked and raced up and said: 'You can't graffiti on the tanks!' Gerry said: 'I'm sorry, mate; we did. We did it in Vietnam.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The War Memorial's galleries showcase one of the world's greatest military collections, thus fulfilling Charles Bean's vision of a national memorial. The displays provide direct evidence of the lives, actions and fate of the men and women who served and died for Australia in war and military operations. The loss of over 60,000 Australian lives in the First World War and 40,000 in the Second World War, as well as the numerous deaths in other conflicts, might become little more than statistical information were it not for the memorial's national collection, which illustrates the effect of war on individuals, families, and communities. The memorial's historians research and foster research into Australia's military history. This provides the depth and breadth of knowledge required to support the memorial's unique displays and commemorative functions. At the heart of the memorial building is the Roll of Honour: a long series of bronze panels recording the names of over 102,000 members of the Australian armed forces who have died during or as a result of war service, warlike service, non-warlike service and certain peacetime operations. The database is compiled from data used to create the Roll of Honour and is available on the memorial's web site. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.</span>

I note that the need for those to be conducted was due to an administrative error at the opposition end and that you, Madam Speaker, followed the necessary protocols in terms of making information available to the opposition. Having now had a chance personally to go through the bill, I can say that it is completely consistent with the oral briefings which had been given. It makes sense for the running of the parliament and particularly for the responsibility that you as one of the Presiding Officers have with respect to the security of parliament itself and for the expertise that is able to be added by the Australian Federal Police. The opposition is happy to support the bill and to see its quick progress through all stages.</span>

The board provides advice, as required, to the Presiding Officers on security policy and the management of security measures for Parliament House. It is an important change and will ensure the best advice is provided to the Presiding Officers to ensure the security of the House and all who work and visit here. I want to commend both you and the President of the Senate for your work in relation to these most important matters.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  The Commemorative Roll commemorates Australians who died during or as a result of service in wars, conflicts or operations identical with the Roll of Honour but who are not eligible for inclusion on the Roll of Honour. The Australian War Memorial, in my electorate of Fraser, is the centre of the nation's tribute to the courage and sacrifice of generations, the men and women who have helped defend our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is often a need to pause history, to be sure that people will remember what has happened. The Australian War Memorial stands forever as an eternal reminder, as testament to Australia's war heritage and as a symbol of national mourning. It is located on the parliamentary axis so that we in this building who have the solemn duty of sending Australian forces into conflict must look out upon the War Memorial as a reminder of that duty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">War memorials have a number of functions. They are a fixed point for grief, a place for people to remember those who died and they also represent those who are absent. For many Australians, the War Memorial's commemorative focus provides a deeply emotional and personal link with those who have served the nation in a time of war. The Australian War Memorial links the past to the present and enables Australians to remember and respect the sacrifice of those who died during conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian War Memorial is also an important source of information for young Australians in understanding the sacrifices made by past generations. The sheer scale of suffering of these major wars is almost beyond our comprehension. The Australian War Memorial stands as the official and public recognition of that pain and those sacrifices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year the Abbott government cut the Australian War Memorial's popular Travelling Exhibitions program, effective immediately. This heartless cut will mean hundreds of thousands of Australians will no longer have access to important history about Australia's involvement in wars and the sacrifice of so many. The Travelling Exhibitions program ran continuously for 17 years, as part of the memorial's National Collection Branch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its inception, the Travelling Exhibitions program has seen 40 exhibitions travel to venues in every state and territory in Australia and to many international venues. To date, an audience of over 3.8 million visitors outside Canberra viewed those exhibitions. The exhibitions in the memorial's galleries take advantage of the exceptional and diverse national collection to deliver interactive visitor experiences that are both engaging and educational. It is a disgrace that, while the government cut the entire funding for this valuable program, they have ticked off on $810,000 in media monitoring and market research programs for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This is yet another broken promise from the Prime Minister, who, before the election said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition will take the action necessary to preserve, protect and enhance the Australian War Memorial.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian War Memorial commemorates the service and sacrifice of Australian service men and women who have died in the wars and conflicts in which Australia has participated. It is a cultural institution of international standing and one of Australia's leading major tourist attractions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the time of its inception, the memorial was conceived as a shrine, a museum that supports commemoration through understanding and an archive holding key war records. Its development down through the years has remained consistent with this concept. The memorial is regarded as a unique and special place by many Australians. For many Australians its commemorative focus provides a deeply emotional and personal link with those who have served the nation in time of war. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exhibitions in the memorial's galleries are supported by high-quality, authoritative scholarship in military history, and by conservation techniques and practices that safeguard the memorial's collection. For the beginning of the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac it is more important than ever that Australians have access to our proud history. Australians visit the Australian War Memorial to remember and pay tribute to those who have lost their lives in war, conflicts, or peacekeeping operations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Anzac Centenary is a milestone of special significance for all Australians. The First World War helped to shape us as a people and a nation. During the Anzac Centenary we not only remember the original Anzacs, who served at Gallipoli and the Western Front, but commemorate more than a century of service by Australian service men and women. The Anzac Centenary program encompasses all wars, conflicts and peace-keeping operations in which Australians have been involved. It aims to give all Australians the opportunity to honour the service and sacrifice of all those who have worn our nation's uniform, including the more than 102,000 who have made the supreme sacrifice. It also aims to encourage all Australians to reflect upon and learn more about Australia's military history, its costs and its impacts on our nation.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>): It is my great pleasure to rise to speak in the debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. Before we got to the details of the bill, we had the unfortunate circumstance of sitting through the contributions from the member for Griffith and the member for Corio last night. I would like to make some comments on the contributions from that side of the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, the proposition put forward that Comcare simply do not have enough inspectors to enforce this legislation is plain wrong. My understanding is that, effectively, every state has some accreditors and inspectors from the state population who can enforce not only this legislation, but the state legislation and a whole pile of other things—including electrical safety acts and a wide range of legislation, including Comcare legislation. I wonder how those opposite think that this has been done for the last 15 years or more. Quite simply, we have public servants; we have federal activities; we have federal ownership of assets all over this country. Comcare has been providing those services for well over a decade, to the best of my knowledge. So it is quite simply outrageous that opposition members make these claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now turn to the bill itself. This is a bill which effectively allows employers who operate over multiple jurisdictions to insure through one agency, which is Comcare. It is about reducing red tape. As someone who has worked in the industry for many, many years, I know that it is exceptionally difficult for companies to cross state borders and operate across a range of legislation. I will give you some very simple examples. Currently—and these are some changes that we have just made—if you wish to construct a building which has a contribution from the Commonwealth valued at over $5 million you need to be a construction firm which is accredited with the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner. Unfortunately, to gain an accreditation with the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner it takes a substantial amount of people and money, and you then need to maintain that accreditation. When you cross the border to Queensland, for example, you need to be accredited under what is called the PQC system for construction in Queensland. Not only do you need federal safety accreditation but you also need to be a prequalified contractor between levels 1 and 4.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that we have is that in regional areas projects like this simply cannot be built by a local builder—someone who could easily do the work and someone who is accredited inside one of the state systems. Unfortunately, they do not have the capacity to pay to be accredited at the federal level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good piece of legislation. It provides an opportunity for a large organisation to simply have one system for insurance which looks after their employees. If staff such as electricians in these organisations—and this is a different set of legislation—are moved around different states, they need to be relicensed in other areas. Quite simply, you could be working at the southern end of the country. If you gain employment at a large construction project in the northern end of the country, you would then need to pay for a whole lot of licensing to be accredited in that state as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is not just around this legislation that this is an issue. It costs an enormous amount of money and it adds onto something that is commonly known as pass-through. Unfortunately, pass-through is costing the Australian taxpayer an enormous amount of money. It means that every organisation that gets involved in a project from top to bottom takes their little piece—their little cut—as they are entitled to. Pass-through could add up to 30 or 40 per cent. Unfortunately, that means that you get less value on the ground. An absolutely outrageous example of this was the BER projects put forward by the opposition when they were in government. BER projects were some of the most expensive projects I have ever seen. Pass-through on those projects was enormous. The actual square-metre rate was outrageous. There were lots of builders who made an enormous amount of money on things which were unnecessary. </span>

                    </a>  Thank you, very much.  The cost to the taxpayer is important. The bill deals with a number of different areas, including, for example, changes around serious and wilful misconduct. I do not think that it is reasonable, and I am sure that the people of Australia would not think that it is reasonable, that if you leave your workplace in your lunch hour and you go down the road and perform hang-gliding—or go rock-climbing, go for a run, or play Rugby League—you would expect the employer to cover these things if you are injured. Quite simply, this is a good change and it is something that should be supported. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The responsibility for self is something I think we have lost over some decades. You should be responsible for yourself and the actions that you take. The multiple layers of legislation—whether it in OHS, WorkCover or common law—makes it very, very difficult for people to be self-aware. One of the complaints I get from tradesmen, in particular—older tradesmen who have been around for some time—is that the skill base has been lost by those in the younger generation. The things that they need, to have to be safe and to be able to perform the activities that are required, have been lost. Older tradesmen talk about working at heights as something which they were trained in. Now it is something that you receive a certificate for, which in my view is just unhelpful. Unfortunately, all of these layers of legislation result in reams and reams of paperwork for these organisations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has been a lead auditor, accredited with RAB/QSA, to assess construction sites and a whole pile of other activities, I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what this results in is risk-shifting. Quite simply, organisations now try to ensure that they pass audit to be able to get their work done, because if they do not pass audit they quite simply get knocked off the list and no longer win any more construction projects. There are ways that they manage to do this. For instance, as an auditor, you will roll up to the site and in some circumstances there will be no workers there, because on that day they just happen to be unavailable, or the concrete pour was not ready and so they all had the day off. You end up at a site which is literally empty. There is no machinery, no equipment, but there is an office full of paperwork for you to look through. Now, paperwork, unfortunately, does not help in improving OHS risks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the contribution from the member for Griffith and I agree that 159 deaths or any death in a workplace is unacceptable. However, as someone who has been involved in investigating any number of these things, unfortunately, it is atypical that it is something very simple which causes a fatality. A person steps forward, they step back, they step sideways and they do not look, and that is something which is very difficult to manage and control. It is an absolute tragedy for their families; it is a tragedy for the organisation; it is bad for morale; and it is bad all round for the nation. I agree 100 per cent that we do not want any fatalities in workplaces. The member for Griffith also commented on common law damages in Queensland and how there might be opportunities for these to shift; they are not available under Comcare. Unfortunately, the best benefit out of common law goes to funding lawyers. Lawyers make an enormous amount of money out of common law claims and processes. I think there is a better way to deal with that, and it is something which we should look at in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is all about reducing red tape, and that is something which I support. As I said previously, there are a number of organisations which Comcare already covers for insurance, including Defence and the Public Service. There are systems in place already that are able to deal with enforcement of the act, and of course investigation of that should be warranted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill which I support. It allows companies who operate in multiple jurisdictions to reduce some of their costs. One of the great benefits of reducing costs for employers is that it gives them the ability to employ more people, and that is something which we should all be concerned about. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to make this contribution. I support the bill. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, if enacted, will directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. Some of the speakers on this bill have highlighted why this bill is so important. I want to draw out one of the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, to show just how out of touch some members of this parliament are. I seriously doubt the majority of workers in Australia go hang gliding in their lunchbreak. I am yet to meet a worker who in their 40- or 50-minute lunchbreak can go hang gliding and that is the reason they should not qualify for workers compensation if an injury occurs. That simply does not happen in Australian workplaces. I have never met a cleaner, I have never met a child-care worker and I have never met a nurse or an ambo who, in their lunchbreak, rather than eating their lunch, rather than doing whatever personal jobs they may have, like going to the bank or paying their bills or sitting down and just resting, has gone hang gliding. That is the quality of the contributions from, and the understanding of, some of the members of the government. It is simply outrageous to attack workers in that way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to do one thing. This bill seeks to weaken the protection and support for workers who have been injured in their workplace—but we should not be surprised by that, coming from this government, because attacking workers seems to be the No. 1 job of this government. They will tell you that this bill is about reducing red tape and about reducing the cost and the impost on business. That is just simply not true. This bill is about removing the rights of Australian workers to fair and reasonable cover when they suffer the misfortune of a workplace related injury. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government, in drafting this bill, did not consult or flag these changes prior to the election, prior to their gaining government. So this is another example of where they have not been honest with Australian workers and the Australian people about what they intended to do in government. We on this side of the House are concerned—I am concerned—that the proposed changes will create huge costs in the future by effectively creating high-risk gaps in the health and safety monitoring within this country. What we are saying is that, if people move into a system that does not have the correct care, if workers rights are put at risk, if their safety is put at risk, the long-term costs could be enormous, not just for workplaces, not just for premiums and not just for what businesses will pay but also for our health system. The government must immediately guarantee that no worker will be worse off under this system. That is something they have not done. The government have not come in here and guaranteed that no worker will be worse off—but I am sure they did prior to the election! They seem to be doing that a lot at the moment: there is what they said before the election and what they say after the election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is again attacking the fair wages and conditions and the workplace health and safety of thousands and thousands, if not millions, of workers in this country. An example of the way in which the government is attacking workplace health and safety is through this bill. The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 proposes seriously negative changes to the Comcare scheme. This bill will directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. As I said, the government must stop this from happening. They must fix the problems in this bill before they put workers at risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the government has little understanding of this issue; they have failed to meet injured workers. Not every professional job is a desk job. Not in every professional job do people have the luxury that we have of donning a suit and being able to walk around. The majority of low-paid workers jobs—whether they be in construction, cleaning, nursing or age care—are manual jobs, they are physical jobs and injuries do occur </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the cleaning industry repetitive work—the lifting, the cleaning and all the rest of the manual work—quite commonly leads to long-term injuries to the back and shoulders. People have to retire early because of serious injury and then are not able to work. To offer those workers decent schemes for occupational health and safety and compensation is not red tape. It is not red tape to ensure that those workers get the support that they need. A survey by United Voice of Spotless Cleaning members found that they do not have enough time to do the job properly and that increases the risk of injury. In fact, almost 60 per cent of Spotless cleaners said that they suffered from stress as a result of unreasonable workloads, and we are not just talking about the emotional stress; we are talking about the physical stress on the body. Stress takes its  toll on cleaners, with many reporting physical injuries, personal breakdowns and even sometimes pressure at home because they are simply crippled by their workloads. If these cleaners do sustain an injury, it means that they can no longer work, but what is this government's solution? It is not to support them, but to move to a scheme with weaker support for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In construction, forestry and mining industries a worker is seriously injured or dies every six minutes. These are high-risk physical jobs, and rather than offering those who are seriously injured a decent insurance system and the best support, this government, in this legislation, is weakening their rights and their access to decent support. Construction workers frequently rank safety as the No. 1 priority. To give you one example of CFMEU member: Kym was only 17 at the time and he said it was a scary day down there at the Barcoo Outlet. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of our fellow workers did not come home from work that day. He got pinned up against a panel and got squashed. It was very scary. He was only 24.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kym's experience unfortunately is not unique in the Australian construction industry. Too many people have attended funerals of friends and family who have died from workplace related injuries; too many have had serious injuries that prevent them from working for the rest of their lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just look at the statistics: the agricultural, forestry, fishing, manufacturing, transport and storage industries have had the highest incident rates of serious injuries for many years. In fact, in 2011-12 the rates were up 80 per cent on other industries. Given these results, there is more need than ever for stronger support for workers compensation—not weaker, but stronger support. Labourers and those in similar occupations—production workers, transport workers, tradespersons—have the highest incident rates of serious injury. The physical and manual jobs have the highest rate of serious injury, and we need to ensure that they get the best support. Yet, as many speakers from this side of the House have noted, this bill seeks to weaken that support. These occupations have consistently had double the rate of injuries of all other occupations. Within the current make-up of the workforce there are some jobs that are incredibly physical and they do take a toll on the body. We need to make sure that there is a workers compensation scheme that can support them to the rest of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget the day that the county court in Victoria handed down a record fine resulting from the death of a worker at the Fosters Abbotsford Brewery. The Fosters Group was fined more than $1.25 million after pleading guilty to two workplace safety charges. Following the upgrade of the Victorian Occupational Health &amp; Safety Act, the fine was the highest ever imposed for an individual. I will never forget the sadness of the workplace delegates on that day. The death of their co-worker could have been avoided, had the company worked with their OH&amp;S committee and complied with various directives and key notices from Worksafe. Worse still, a worker had been seriously injured in a similar accident only 12 months earlier. To this day that worker is still not able to work and requires support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I will tell the story of Rosa, who was a Crown Casino shop delegate and who worked as a security officer. She turned up to work one day and out of nowhere was king hit. It was an awful incident. As a result of that king hit, Rosa suffered a brain injury, has terrible short-term memory loss and can never work again. Where is the support for Rosa? It is up to us and to states and the Commonwealth to ensure that she gets the best possible compensation and support. But this bill weakens her position and makes it harder for Rosa and people like her to receive the support that they need and deserve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government in this bill seeks to weaken the support for any worker and their family who find themselves in tragic situations like Rosa's. Let us put to one side that these workplace injuries could have been avoided with stronger occupational health and safety practices. I am sure it is another area of red tape that this government would like to dismantle. This bill seeks to weaken the support for workers who have been injured. To make a small saving for businesses, injured workers and their families will have to bear the financial and emotional hardship of being excluded from certain aspects of workers compensation. This bill proposes the reintroduction of the exclusion from eligibility for workers compensation during recess breaks. The government's justification for this is that, on their recess breaks, they are not having lunch in the tearoom, but are out there hang-gliding. That is why they have put forward this legislation—because they believe that people are not sitting in the tearoom; what they are doing is hang-gliding or playing rugby. Who on earth does that on their lunch break? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current act provides for an employee to be covered for temporary absences from work during ordinary recesses. That provision should stay. This bill also seeks to weaken common-law damages claims and common-law rights that should exist. The bill is a series of exclusions from compensation that will make Comcare an outlier for Australia for the harsh and unjust way it would treat injured or deceased workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further issues include that Comcare is not equipped or designed to cope with this level of expansion. Only 44 health and safety inspectors currently work for Comcare. If the government are serious about this bill, are they going to increase the number of inspectors employed by Comcare? Are they going to start talking about a new employment plan? It is really important. If there are currently 44, one of those 44 will probably never make their way to Bendigo for an inspection to look at what possible breaches there could be. So is the government planning to increase the number of inspectors that we have? In my state of Victoria we have already seen a weakening and a reduction in the number of safety inspectors, which is already down to 212. This is why some unions in our state have increased the number of health and safety representatives—because they know that they are not getting the support from their governments that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, this bill is a bad bill. It will create confusion, anomalies and unfairness. It is sadly true of the government's entire approach to working people. They seek to demonise workers, not support them. They seek to say that laws and acts that exist to ensure that workers get the best possible support in a moment of tragedy, when they incur a workplace injury, are red tape. This bill is a bad bill and it should be opposed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  We oppose the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 because it is a vicious attack on workers' safety and on their protection at work. It is a throwback to the Howard years, to those years of Work Choices and attacks on workers. It disregards workers' interests and their safety at work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would observe that this bill is completely inconsistent with the Abbott government's supposed attitude to federation. What this bill represents is a centralisation of workers compensation by stealth, by loophole, by the back door, by raiding other governments' responsibilities—in this case, raiding the state government responsibilities on workers compensation and workers' safety. There have been no discussions, no conversation with interested parties, no dialogue and no warning that the government will take this approach. There is nothing about it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Real Solutions</span>, that infamous document. This is simply reaching back into the old jumbled toolbox of the Howard years to come up with a bill that viciously disregards people's safety at work. It is completely intellectually inconsistent with every other piece of legislation and act of direction that they might be putting forward. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had the Commission of Audit, which the government has relied upon to justify their very unfair budget—$80 billion worth of cuts to health and education and a GP tax on everybody who walks through a waiting room, everybody who gets a blood test or a scan. Yet recommendation No. 7 of the Commission of Audit, 'Reforming the Federation—clarifying roles and responsibilities', talks about the roles of Commonwealth and state governments and then being informed by:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the government's Commission of Audit said. What do we find in this bill? We find a completely incoherent raiding of state government responsibilities. Is it supported by state governments? Has there been a dialogue with state governments? No. The shadow minister, the member for O'Connor, pointed out that this is opposed by the Queensland government, opposed by the Territory government—and for very good reasons: this bill has not been thought out, it undermines workers safety and it runs completely against good order between state and Commonwealth governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been very impressed by some of the speeches and contributions of those opposite. People have been talking about hang-gliding—maybe we should call it the 'hang-gliding bill'; I do not know. There is that sort of fanciful disregard for workers. As if anybody is going hang-gliding on their rest break. It is just a bizarre assertion. I took note of the speech by the member for Lyons yesterday. He was complaining that roofers, people in the building industry, had to wear steel-capped boots. Where is this guy? He is back in the pre-1930s; he is back in the 1890s. It is bizarre. In talking about health and safety, he states in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is, quite frankly, insidious.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the word he used in relation to safety at work—'insidious'. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Collins English Dictionary</span>, which has been going since 1819, describes 'insidious' as 'stealthy, subtle, cunning, or treacherous' and 'working in a subtle or apparently innocuous way, but nevertheless deadly'. I would submit that he should not be saying that about health and safety in this country, about people having to wear safety boots—steel-capped boots. He should be saying that about this bill and about the government's approach, because it is insidious. It is insidious and it is treacherous, for all the reasons I said before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The details of this bill—and we saw this during the Howard years—basically act to undermine state government workers compensation schemes, because it plucks very large employers, national employers, out of the state-based schemes and puts them in a scheme that was basically designed for Commonwealth public servants. So it does not matter whether you are a retail worker in South Australia, or you drive trucks, or you work in warehouses, or you are an electrician. Suddenly, you are plucked out of a system that you might have been employed under for years—and not just a compensation system, but also the regulation of your workplace in relation to health and safety. Suddenly, you are plucked out of the system that you know well, that your employer knows well, that your union might know well or your representative might know well. You are plucked out of that system and placed in a system that is designed for Commonwealth public servants, and nobody else. I have seen cases of workers who have been in that situation—Australia Post is a pretty clear example of where this has happened—and if those workers had a choice of which system they were given, or which system they were to be employed under, they would choose the state-based schemes every single time. And they would be wise to do so, because there is a lot of red tape in the system. It might not be red tape for employers, but it is red tape for workers. They have to jump through many, many hoops as compared to the state-based compensation systems.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are just 44 inspectors. I think we have about 70 in South Australia, from memory. That might be a bit old now, but it would be at least a third higher than the current Commonwealth number is for the entire country. Yet we expect these 44 people not only to inspect the workplaces of Commonwealth public servants but also to now get on planes to go and inspect workplaces in Adelaide or Port Hedland—</span>

It sounds good if you are on conservative talkback radio, or at the front bar. It sounds good if you just shoot your mouth off. But it is not actually that good, because what you are doing is moving away from a no-fault scheme to a scheme that does apply blame and fault. If you want that system, we will start having industrial manslaughter laws in this country, and we will start assigning blame not just to workers but to companies, to company directors and to managers who act in the same way—who act with wilful disregard for people's lives or for injuring people. That is what happens when you move away from a no-fault scheme, which is the basis of all of these health and safety schemes since they were first introduced in the United Kingdom in the 1970s. I forget the Lord who made the recommendations.</span>

In this case, they try to tell us that they are for small government, they try to tell us that they want to make changes to our Federation, and then they walk into this parliament with a bill that centralises health and safety in this country without any cooperation or consideration or thinking or consultation with the states, with the unions, with companies or with anybody else. This is a bad idea. It is a bad bill. It is bad for workers, bad for the country, and bad for state governments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  What this government does not realise is that one person's red tape is another person's protection. For people who have to earn a living by going to work to bring home an income, that protection can literally be the difference between life and death. That protection can be the difference between whether you come home safe and sound or whether you come home with an injury. And so to say that we can just look at this bill simply in the context as part of a reduction in red tape is to miss a fundamental point. What we should be debating here in this place is how can we make Australian workplaces safer. What we should be debating is how can we make sure that everyone who goes to work at the start of the day or the start of their shift comes home safe and sound. That should be the guiding principle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we have this bill. What will this bill mean in practice? This bill will mean that when someone in an affected workplace fronts up for work there will be fewer requirements that their workplace is safe. It means that if someone who fronts up for work gets injured, they will have fewer rights, and their family will have fewer rights, and less compensation. How will this bill do that? This bill will make it easier for employers to slip out of at times rigorous safety standards in state-based schemes and move into a federal scheme that was not designed to look after people's safety in the same way that state schemes were. The federal scheme has in many significant respects some lower standards. It has less enforcement, so fewer inspectors who go around and make sure the scheme gets enforced, and it provides fewer rights if a worker is injured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand why this is the case it is important to understand how these schemes developed and why there is a difference in our federated country between the Commonwealth scheme and the state schemes. The state schemes have traditionally had primary responsibility for looking after most of the workers in this country—looking after their rights when it comes to safety and looking after their rights when it comes to compensation. Regulation for most of the more dangerous work we have in this country, including in areas like construction and mining, has been developed in the state systems. That is just the fact—it is a reality of our federation and of our Constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also a fact that these industries are much more dangerous than other occupations. Safe Work Australia tells us that over the last five years almost one worker dies a week in the construction industry—211 over the five years from 2008 to 2012. That is nearly twice the national rate for other industries. They also tell us that the rate of getting serious injuries in the construction industry is nearly 50 per cent higher than the national average. You only have to look across to New Zealand and see the disaster of the Pike River mine, you only have to look at Beaconsfield in Tasmania and you only have to look at the serious diseases, such as black lung, that mineworkers get elsewhere around the world to understand the dangerous nature of working in the mining sector. There are many other dangerous industries. Over time, in the state-based systems we have developed good systems of safety for those industries. They could always be better but the systems that have been developed in many respects are world leading. After the Pike River collapse, New Zealand looked at the check inspector system of regulating mineworkers that we have here, and they picked up a lot of what the Australian states are currently doing. In mining, for example, people whose job it is to look after the health and safety of workers have a seat at the table and have the ability to ensure that laws are enforced. No-one is going to look out for a person's safety at work quite like someone who is working in the workplace themselves, or who comes from it. They have the strongest interest in making sure that the workplace is safe and they deserve a seat at the table and to have a role in determining whether or not health and safety requirements are being complied with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Separately from all that, we have had developing over time the Commonwealth system. Because, again, of the division of powers between the state and federal parliaments, the Commonwealth system has been largely developed around white-collar workers who work in Commonwealth agencies or, over time, with privatisation and the like, in competitors to those Commonwealth agencies. When you compare the two, you find that the standards are quite different, the level of rigor is quite different, the level of involvement of people at work in enforcing their own safety at work is quite different and the capacity of the various agencies to enforce safety at work is different. Comcare has 44 inspectors. Queensland has 216—that is just in Queensland, let alone the rest of the country. They are the people who are responsible for doing the jobs you see in the ads that the state agencies run regularly on television, where an employer fears the knock at the door from the workplace inspector, who is able to come in and check that health and safety regulations are being complied with. So there are 216 in Queensland and 44 for the whole of the Commonwealth in Comcare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not only much less regulation and enforcement going on at the federal level; there is a massive difference in what happens if that regulation is breached and a worker gets injured. Under the Commonwealth scheme you cannot sue for damages at common law in the same way that you can in the states. You cannot go and get the payment that you are entitled to if the employer has been guilty of negligence. Instead, you get the equivalent of a pension-style payment under the Comcare scheme. Under the existing federal scheme, and under this bill, you will not be covered when you are on your breaks. It may come as news to those in the government, but most people when they are on their breaks are not necessarily on free time at the place they would choose to be if they did not have to be at work. Most people do not voluntarily on their day off come into the office and sit in the lunch room. Most people on their day off do not voluntarily go out at 10.30 and sit somewhere in the city to have a 10-minute break. You are having a break, because you are having a break from work. That is why you are covered in the state schemes. But under this bill you will not be covered, if people move you into this new federal scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you move into this new federal scheme, you also will not be covered in cases of misconduct. This is important. This bill says that if someone dies on the job, for example, and their family is then seeking compensation for them, the employer or the insurer can say, 'Hang on—they weren't doing the job properly. I think they were committing misconduct. I'm going to challenge this.' Then, when the person dies, the family is now going to have to be put through a court case to prove whether their mum or dad, who has just been killed at work, was committing misconduct at the time. And their payments will be held up while all of that is happening, because the employer or the insurer will be appealing it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will move away from the no-fault scheme that we have at the moment to one that is based on exactly that kind of litigation. As the previous speaker alluded to, you are not going to see, on the other side, the Commonwealth government saying, 'Oh well, it's time to reintroduce Commonwealth industrial manslaughter laws to make sure that employers are held to account and sent to prison if they do the wrong thing.' You are not going to see a lifting of standards. Instead, you are going to be putting families and people who rely on compensation for someone who has been injured through double the pain: the pain of losing someone who has been injured or killed at work and then the pain of having to go through a court case to determine whether they committed misconduct. That is how this government thinks that people who die or get injured at work should be treated. Of course, the dispute settlement procedures under the federal scheme are much more difficult to access than for people in the state system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that misconduct point: the government refers to the various reviews all the time during their speeches and in the explanatory memorandum, including the Hanks review. The Hanks review said there was no problem with that clause and did not recommend any change, but that does not stop the government from saying, 'We're going to make life even tougher for people at work.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this government want to do? Faced with those two different schemes and standards of work, the government is asking, 'How wide can we open the door for employers to move as quickly as possible from those state schemes that give workers better protection into the federal scheme, so they can save a bit of money? How quickly can we encourage people through so that standards of safety and compensation can be dropped?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to have a discussion about harmonising national safety and compensation laws, then the questions should be, 'How can we lift safety for people at work? How can we ensure that everyone has the best access to compensation, if they are unfortunate enough to get injured or someone in their family is getting injured?' Instead, the government is doing it the other way round: 'How can we race to the bottom as quickly as we possibly can?' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a surprise to some of us who followed what this government has done when it comes to protecting people's rights at work for a number of years. It may well come as a surprise to people who voted for the government, because the government did not tell them before the election that this was on the books. The government did not tell them before the election, 'We're potentially going to make your workplaces less safe and give you less compensation if you get injured.' It is becoming clearer day by day that there is a reason this government did not tell people what they were doing or what they intended to do before the election: had they told them, they would have been completely unelectable. Had they told people, 'We're going to charge you more to go and see the doctor, we're going to take money out of public schools and hospitals and we're going to make your workplaces less safe,' no-one would have voted for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill that was not promised or put up in lights before the election. It is a bill that will reduce safety for people at work and will reduce the compensation for people who are injured. On that basis this bill should be opposed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I have followed this debate across the chamber and I am sad that we had the member for Lyons refer to the insidious creep of health and safety. You would have thought that even the most conservative member of this parliament would understand the importance of health and safety in the workplace, the need to regulate it properly and look after the interests of workers—as well as employers, I might say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of this bill is very clear, to me at least. It will tear away safety protections for many all over this country. It will have the effect of directly and indirectly risking the workplace health and safety of Australian workers in every state and territory. It will remove the rights of workers to a fair and reasonable cover when they suffer workplace injury or illness, if their employer comes under this legislation. This is from a government who, as we were reminded before the last election, said there would be no changes to workplace relations in their first term. This is a change to workplace relations, let there be no doubt about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in the preparation of this proposal there has been no adequate consultation with those who will be affected by it or their representatives. It was not flagged before the election; it is not part of their election policy; and it is legislation without a mandate but also without any real policy justification. It undercuts all existing workers compensation around this country—that is what its effect will be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that workers compensation legislation should have two main principles: to prevent work-related injury or illness from occurring in the first place; and to provide fair benefits to help and compensate those workers who suffer injury or illness as a result of their work. This will do precisely the opposite. It is indeed a sad indictment of this government and of those who sit on the government benches, because it will mean that there will be workers who will suffer the consequences of work injuries for the rest of their lives without any assistance from a workers compensation scheme, potentially. It means that potentially, workers doing the same job but with a different employer, who suffer a similar injury or injuries, will have different workers compensation rights and different health and safety standards applied to them—even though they might live in the same jurisdiction. How can this be sustainable? The worker who is covered by Comcare will have fewer rights and fewer health and safety protections, all in the name of small savings, apparently, and of cutting red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard discussion around the issue of no coverage under this legislation for ordinary recess breaks. How can anyone contemplate that you should excise recess breaks out of a workers compensation arrangement? It is worthwhile contemplating for a moment the history of this: the Hawke government in 1998—and I was a member of that government; I remember the debates around the country at the time—established the Comcare scheme, which protected workers temporarily absent from work during an ordinary recess like a lunch break. That was in 1988. Is it any surprise to us that in 2007, under the Howard government's Work Choices scheme, this was removed? So why should we be surprised that the Abbott government chooses to reintroduce this precise proposal—to exempt ordinary recess breaks from coverage? That is just a damnation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also proposed in this bill, as we know now, that there be no coverage for death and serious and permanent injury if wilful misconduct is alleged. What a mean and gratuitous proposal this is. Nearly all jurisdictions across this country have exclusionary provision that deny compensation for injuries caused by wilful misconduct; however, in the case of a death or serious and permanent incapacity, Australian workers compensation schemes have historically, over tens of years, made an exception. This bill, if passed, would mean that Comcare will be the only workers compensation scheme in the country to exclude assistance in cases of deceased or seriously permanently incapacitated workers, if the death or incapacity happened as a result of what is described as 'wilful misconduct'. This is really hard to understand. What penny-pinching government would want to deny the capacity for the family of someone who is deceased or permanently incapacitated to have access to support? But that is precisely what this legislation does. And this also: Comcare currently denies workers compensation to those who voluntarily and unreasonably submit to a normal risk or injury during an ordinary recess. This bill extends that conclusion to usual working hours. This change means that what is and is not a voluntary assumption of abnormal risk when undertaking work will be the subject of endless and costly legal disputation. It means no protection for vulnerable workers; those who are asked or directed to do dangerous jobs by their coworkers, who are afraid of losing their jobs. It means—and I notice that some people have just arrived in the gallery—no protection for police, or for nurses, or for workers who are exposed to risk as part of their normal working day. Some workers who are injured or ill because of their job may have no workers compensation whatsoever: no assistance with medical bills, no support for rehabilitation, and no income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not my intention to traverse the whole of the legislation, because others have done that. But I want to go to some of the submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill. In particular, I want to go to the submission from the Northern Territory government. I do it for two reasons: firstly, I think it is not a bad submission, because it raises some serious questions; and secondly, it makes it very clear how this bill is discriminatory in its effect and impacts upon every community across the country. In that submission the Northern Territory government say: 'It is difficult to estimate how many employers would pursue an option to participate in the Comcare scheme but the potential consequence could be: …loss of an NT based claims service for injured workers.' That is really important, because what they are concerned about is the size of the premium pool, the potential for rates to increase, and the cost of insurance going up. I mention that because I think it is a very good submission, in that context. Yet at the same time, this week—this very week—the Northern Territory government of its own volition has taken the step of selling off the Territory Insurance Office to Allianz. This is going to mean that on the one hand we have them saying, 'we are concerned about this piece of Commonwealth legislation which could have a significant impact on people who need insurance on the Northern Territory for workers compensation'—employers and employees—and on the other hand they are actually selling the Territory Insurance Office—a government insurance office. It will—absolutely—mean that premium rates across the Northern Territory will go up, and that some insurance will not be available. There is real concern about the impact of that stupid decision—that really asinine decision—by the Northern Territory government, and the impact it will have on communities across the Northern Territory, including the people of Darwin, who will potentially suffer some cyclonic event into the future; or floods in Alice Springs; or floods in Katherine. We know that some of these products which are currently supplied and underwritten by the Northern Territory government through the Territory Insurance Office are potentially not going to be provided into the future. And if they are provided, we can absolutely guarantee—absolutely—that every Northern Territory insurance holder who is under the TIO insurance policies and is now transferred to Allianz will have their rates increased, we think by anything up to 200 or 300 per cent. That is a condemnation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, if you accept on the one hand the importance of the submission that the Northern Territory government has made, around this insurance issue of Comcare in the Northern Territory, and around this bill, you have to say to yourself: how can they do that then—and now actually sell off the Territory Insurance Office? The Northern Territory community is awake to them and the Northern Territory community will mark them down. I am positive that they will get the retribution they properly deserve when the next Northern Territory general election comes along.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear to us that this piece of legislation should not be supported. It is unfair, anomalous and confusing for small business and for workers. Injured workers lose rights and benefits. It weakens occupational health and safety. It reintroduces three unfair and unnecessary exclusions to injured workers claiming workers compensation. It saves little, if any, money. We will oppose this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise to sum up the debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">2014</span> on behalf of the Minister for Education and the relevant minister in the Senate. Let me make this point from the outset: having heard much of the debate from the opposition and the representative from the Greens, I would note that throughout the period of the home insulation program we warned, industry warned, the community warned and the media warned of safety risks. Recently, the royal commissioner Ian Hanger QC made profound findings that warnings had been ignored, that the government had ample opportunity to heed the advice given in the public domain and elsewhere and, most profoundly and significantly, that the deaths that occurred could have been avoided. I will restate that: the deaths that occurred could have been avoided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, where we had such significant findings by a royal commissioner, which have led to the government engaging in a process of rightly and appropriately working with the families to provide compensation and working with the effected small businesses to provide compensation, I do not think that those on the opposition benches are in any position to provide any commentary whatsoever in relation to safety matters. Their performance in government was a matter of deep and profound regret for the families of those affected, for the businesses affected and for the nation as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all members who have participated in debate but note that, to my regret, the opposition are either being wilfully ignorant or making statements about the provisions of the bill that are simply not sustainable. As we know, employers operating in multiple states have to deal with different workers compensation schemes and work health and safety regulations in each jurisdiction around Australia. This myriad regulation increases red tape for employers and is confusing for workers, who are subject to different regulations and benefits depending on which state or territory they are employed in. For example, an employee of a national bank working in a branch in Perth will have different work health and safety rules and a different workers compensation scheme than an employee of the same bank working in the Sydney office. This simply makes no sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with the government's deregulation agenda and simplification and streamlining approach, this bill will reduce the cost of the regulatory burden on the economy by implementing the recommendations of the review of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, a review commissioned by the former Gillard government and undertaken by Mr Peter Hanks QC and Dr Allan Hawke AC, both of whom are distinguished in their field. Allan Hawke of course has a long tradition of service to Australian governments of all persuasions and has assisted recently in matters in relation to the Northern Territory. Additionally, costs will be reduced by removing injuries from the coverage of the Comcare scheme where those injuries occur in circumstances outside the control of the employer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, the bill proposes amendments to (1) remove the requirement for the Minister for Employment to declare a corporation to be granted a licence for self-insurance while maintaining the ability for the minister to issue directions to the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, which will streamline the current two-stage self-insurance licensing process for certain corporations under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; (2) remove the outdated requirement that a corporation must be in competition with a Commonwealth authority or former Commonwealth authority to enter the Comcare scheme; (3) enable corporations currently required to meet workers compensation obligations under two or more workers compensation laws of a state or territory to apply to the commission to join the Comcare scheme as self-insuring licensees—this is the national employer test; (4) enable the commission to grant licences to related corporations; (5) make consequential changes to extend the coverage provisions of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 to those corporations that obtain a licence to self-insure under the SRC Act; and (6) exclude access to workers compensation where either injuries occur during recess breaks away from an employer's premises or a person engages in serious or wilful misconduct, even if the injury results in death or serious and permanent impairment. The amendments contained in the bill will reduce the regulatory impact on the economy by approximately $32.8 million each year for the next 10 years, which are savings that businesses will then have available to invest, including, potentially, in more jobs and better safety in those enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to issues raised during the debate, the opposition has claimed that the amendments will do a number of things. These claims are not accurate. It was claimed during the debate that the bill was not widely consulted upon by the government and therefore the government has no mandate to bring this bill to the parliament. Not surprisingly, this statement is flatly, plainly false, untrue and incorrect. The amendments in the bill arose largely from the recommendations of the review which was announced by the Gillard government in 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the development of the report of the review and after the report's release in March 2013, public consultations with key stakeholders occurred. Key bodies consulted included, amongst others, unions, workers, employer organisations, insurers, health practitioner bodies, legal practitioners plus licensees and premium payers under the Comcare scheme. Relevant issues raised in the consultation period were considered by government. This bill flows from the recommendations of one of Australia's most distinguished former public servants, respected by both sides of parliament, Allan Hawke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, relevant state and territory officials were consulted on matters, including allowing national employers to join the Comcare scheme, with responses that were obtained from states and territories being taken into consideration by the government prior to the introduction of the bill on 19 March 2014. If I may speculate, given the provenance of the review, the history of the review and the nature of the recommendations, it is my contention that had there not been a change in government a similar bill with identical or almost identical provisions would have been put forward. That is my opinion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, during the debate, it was suggested that the commission and Comcare do not have the experience and capacity to manage the changes proposed in the bill and because of this workplace health and safety would be put at risk. The government clearly rejects this claim. The commission and Comcare have the capacity and experience to manage the proposed changes, and this will not risk workplace health and safety. I repeat that—it will not risk workplace health and safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Self-insurance under the Comcare scheme is funded by regulatory contributions by the licensees that reflect the cost incurred by the commission and Comcare in the performance of their respective regulatory functions. As such, the increased costs of meeting the regulatory responsibilities for both workers compensation and work health and safety will be resourced through the increase in regulatory funding due to the predicted increase in the number of licences. For example, if more companies decide to self-insure, Comcare would need to expand the number of inspectors. Further, Comcare has over the past decade shown it can increase its capacity to regulate non-Commonwealth licensees, including self-insurers , from a wide range of industries, including banking, defence, transport and telecommunications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the SRC Act requires the commission must not grant a licence to an applicant if the applicant's past and likely future performance in complying with work health and safety legislation reveals that it has not met the standards of state legislators in the past and is not likely to meet those required by Comcare as the regulator of the WHS Act and the commission in the future. This compares favourably and dramatically with the loose and unsafe arrangements which were in place during the Home Insulation Program, which defied the warnings of unions, industry and state bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the question of the work health and safety needs of higher risk industries, such as mining, for example, it is the government's expectation that the commission would not approve a self-insurance licence until Comcare has built the necessary capacity over time as it has already done for other industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was further asserted on the topic of the impact of the bill and state and territory workers compensation schemes that changes in the bill will undermine all the existing workers compensation schemes in Australia. There is simply no evidence to support this assertion. During the review and the development of the bill, concerns were raised about the possible impact on the viability of state and territory work health and safety schemes and workers compensation schemes due to a potential exodus of large employers from those schemes. In short, the concerns are that, if large employers move to the Comcare scheme, premium rates will increase for the remaining employers in the state and territory schemes. However, the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks noted that concerns such as these were not supported by the evidence. In particular, actuarial assessments concluded that, the larger the employer was, the closer the premium the employer paid would be to the true cost of claims and expenses for it such that the impact of the exit of such employers would be relatively neutral for state and territory schemes. Advice provided to the government is that circumstances in the work health and safety and workers compensation areas have not changed materially since the 2004 assessment such that the impact will remain minimal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it was claimed in debate that the bill contains a third new exclusionary provision related to voluntary assumptions of a normal risk. That statement is simply incorrect. No such provision exists within the bill. As clearly explained in the explanatory memorandum, the change to the section that deals with voluntary and unreasonable assumption of risk that has been in place since 1988 has merely been consequentially amended. The section that has been in place since 1988 has merely been consequentially amended—I repeat that for emphasis and for the House to understand clearly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the bill excludes access to workers compensation where injuries occur during recess breaks away from an employer's premises where a person engages in serious and wilful misconduct, even if the injury results in death or serious and permanent impairment. This replicates and represents the position that exists in both South Australia and Tasmania and which has done so for some time. I would note that one is currently a Labor jurisdiction and, until recently, the other was a Labor jurisdiction. Where a worker is away from the workplace and undertaking activities, be they dangerous not, associated with the employee's employment or at the request or direction of the employer, they will still be covered if they are subject to injury. In conclusion, I would again like to thank members who participated in the debate on this important legislation. I commend the legislation to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I rise to raise some specific matters, particularly in relation to the summing up by the minister at the table in response to genuine concerns by a number of stakeholders, not least of all state and territory governments that have raised questions around the impact of this legislation. Let's be very clear here: this legislation, in terms of its impact, is broad and deep if enacted and, therefore, it is absolutely critical that the government fully understand the implications of this legislation upon those jurisdictions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I accept that the minister, on behalf of the minister acting on behalf of the Employment Minister, in summing up, responded in the most oblique and brief way to the questions about the impact on other jurisdictions, there needs to be a better understanding, and indeed a better inquiry, as to the impact. I, therefore, rise to make reference to a submission made by the Queensland Newman government in relation to this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a Senate inquiry in relation to this bill, and the Queensland government stands opposed to this bill for a variety of reasons. In that inquiry they submitted that, if enacted, the bill has:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the potential to lead to increased red tape, increased costs and reduced productivity resulting from duplication and overlap in the regulation of work health and safety arrangements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Queensland government has said: rather than reducing red tape, this legislation will increase red tape and will increase costs for employers in the state jurisdiction and reduce productivity. The Queensland government's submission also went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… small businesses may not be in a position to absorb premium fluctuations from a reduced premium pool.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister at the table referred to a Productivity Commission report conducted about 10 years ago, but these are submissions that were made this year in response to this bill because of the adverse impacts they anticipate in the state compensation schemes if this bill is enacted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the fact that the minister may have been sincere in connecting, for example, the home insulation program issues and reviews and the terrible consequences, the deaths of those four young men, to this bill. I would contend that this bill is in direct contradiction to the submissions made by the minister in summing up, because this would take away the oversight of inspectors of workplaces. There are only 44 inspectors in Comcare and hundreds of inspectors in the state compensation scheme. I ask the minister, on behalf of the government, to answer the question as to why he believes there is greater oversight, greater protection for workers and greater likelihood of prevention of an accident or of injury—or, even worse, of death—as a result of the enactment of this bill. I think that is absolutely vital. If one were to support this bill, one would have to believe the minister's assertions that, indeed, Australian workers would be better off. Yet, of course, that is not borne out by the lack of inspectors currently employed under the Commonwealth scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also ask the minister, on behalf of the government, to answer the questions put by the Queensland government—namely, that this is indeed an increase in red tape, an increase in costs, a reduction in productivity and an increase in duplication between the jurisdictions. It is the case that the Prime Minister likes to refer to Federation, the federal structure, the regard for state powers and the responsibility of state governments to conduct their own affairs. It would seem that, if enacted, this bill would fly in the face of the Prime Minister's own views about ensuring that state governments are responsible for their own jurisdiction and therefore the responsibilities they have held since Federation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of the questions I would ask the minister at the table, on behalf of the government, to answer. These are serious questions, and they have been raised by the Queensland government. I think they deserve an answer.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  Let me initially deal with the second of the issues, in relation to the states. Concerns have been raised by the opposition about the impact on the viability of state and territory work health and safety and workers' compensation schemes due to the potential exodus of large employers from the scheme. Let me say this: the Productivity Commission inquiry into national workers' compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks specifically noted that any concerns that exiting premium payers would lead to volatility was not supported by the evidence. In addition, what we have is the review commissioned by the Gillard government and led, of course, by Allan Hawke, who was strongly supportive and in fact provided the basis for the actions we are now taking. So, both the Productivity Commission and one of Australia's most distinguished public servants have provided advice over time in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, actuarial assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission concluded that the larger the employer is, the closer the premium is to the true cost of claims and expenses such that the exit of such large employers would be relatively neutral to the state and territory schemes. In the department's assessment and in the advice that we have, the circumstances have not changed since the Productivity Commission report in any significant material way. Against that background, we have the advice of the Productivity Commission, we have the advice of the Gillard government commissioned reviewers and we have the advice of the department. Unlike—and here I turn to the issue of safety—the previous government, which ignored the advice of the states, of the industry and of the unions in relation to safety under the home insulation program, we have listened to the advice of the Productivity Commission, of the reviewers and of the department. That is why I am confident that not only have we learned from their mistakes on the home insulation program—and we are in the process of having to fix and rectify those tragic errors—but we are making real and significant efforts across the whole of government to ensure that safety and structure are protected in the way in which the reviewers and the Productivity Commission envisaged.</span>

I think it is fair to say that the Queensland government is also not convinced, given the extensive submission they made to the Senate inquiry. There are, of course, other concerns that have been raised with respect to the bill by other jurisdictions. I turn to, if I can, the Northern Territory government, which made a very significant submission to the Senate inquiry in relation to this bill. It included:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are clearly concerns that the Northern Territory government, a conservative government, along with another conservative government, the Queensland government, have raised with the federal government. I would have to argue that in relation to the summing up and in the second reading speech by the minister there has been no attention to many of the matters that have been raised in the submissions by these two jurisdictions in terms of the potentially adverse impacts of this bill on their jurisdictions, on small and medium enterprises, on premium costs, on the way in which those schemes will operate and on job losses that may arise. I ask the minister, therefore, to respond, on behalf of the government, to those specific concerns that have been referred to by the NT government in terms of the impact that may arise if this bill were to be enacted. Clearly, the Northern Territory government has serious concerns not only for workers in that territory but also for businesses that are likely to be adversely impacted upon as a result of this bill being brought into law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister to respond to those matters raised by the NT government. There are currently 44 inspectors in the Comcare scheme. If large employers flee their obligations in the state and territory jurisdictions and go to the Comcare scheme, can the minister on behalf of the government explain the extent to which there will be an increase in inspectors under the Comcare scheme? Inspectors do the very important job of preventing injury in workplaces. Is the minister aware of the detail on whether that would be commensurate with the number of workplaces added to the Comcare scheme insofar as their responsibility to inspect sites? In other words, if Comcare were to double, would that mean Comcare inspectors would double, at the very least? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fair enough to ask a question about what impact there will be on preventing injury and death of workers under this scheme. There is nothing more important than health and safety in workplaces. When you are dealing with employment matters, there is nothing more important than preventing the serious injury or death of a worker on a site, and yet there have been no answers in the submission made by the NT government and no answers about resources dedicated to preventing industry in Comcare, if it were to increase in size, if large employers fled state schemes and joined the national scheme.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  We are traversing ground which has been discussed at length and in repetition. Let me make this point absolutely clear. In relation to the states—as we have said on multiple occasions and as the responsible minister has said—the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks specifically noted that concerns that exiting premium payers would lead to volatility in premium rates are not supported by the evidence. That was backed up by actuarial assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission itself. They found that the larger the employer the closer the premium is to the true cost of claims and expenses, such that if there were to be any exit of large employers this would be relatively neutral to the state and territory schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the answer. Further, the departmental assessment is that circumstances have not changed since the Productivity Commission report in any material way and any impact would therefore be minimal. This is, of course, drawn upon and based upon the work of the widely recognised, esteemed and respected Allan Hawke. In addition, I will say this in relation to safety. The last people to be raising safety issues—given the manifest failures during their last term of government—in the face of statements from industry, unions and the states, to talk about safety, are the now opposition, the then government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to inspectors, and I quote specifically on advice from the department: 'Comcare has shown over the past decade it can increase its capacity to regulate non-Commonwealth licensees, including self-insurers, from a wide range of industries, including banking, Defence, transport and communications.' That is the express, clear and absolute advice we have.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is more efficient for national employers, because of the density of employees under their employ, the logical extension of that is if large employers leave a state or territory scheme to just small and medium enterprises it leaves those remaining enterprises worse off under that state or territory system. They do not have the economies to reduce costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the Northern Territory government has raised concerns. That is why the Queensland government has raised concerns. That is why employers have raised concerns. Small and medium enterprises are concerned about the commercial impact on their businesses. For a government that likes to say they are the government for small business there are adverse impacts that will arise if this bill is enacted. I do not believe the minister on behalf of the government has adequately justified and explained the impact on the remaining enterprises that will not be eligible to shift from the state and territory jurisdictions to Comcare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I invite the minister to add to his answer. If you take out of the state jurisdictions the more efficient, larger employers that have economies of scale and which are more efficient because of those economies of scale, you will leave the smaller and medium enterprises having to pay, per capita, greater amounts to sustain a compensation scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest here. We know that the biggest advocates for the changes to this bill are not conservative or Labor governments at the state and territory level and they are not small and medium enterprises. This is something that Coles and Woolworths and other large employers want, to escape the obligations of superior schemes in terms of entitlements for injured workers and in terms of more resources to prevent injury and death in workplaces. This is something that has been demanded of the government by larger businesses but it will leave small and medium sized enterprises having to pick up the slack, having to pay for the costs associated with those larger enterprises leaving the state and territory jurisdictions. Again, I invite the minister to explain. On the face of what he has said, it does not make sense that large employers will leave and the costs will not go up. Indeed, they will go up. The organisations affected will be small businesses, mum and dad businesses, enterprises that do not have the capacity to pay and, unlike larger enterprises, do not have the capacity to have more efficient means to resource compensation for workers in the event of injury or death.</span>

We are now embarked upon repetition and recitation. The opposition may choose to ignore the advice of the Productivity Commission and the advice of their own reviewers, including, I repeat, the eminent Allan Hawke and the advice of the department. They have history and form in having done so, in terms of the home insulation program, which sadly and tragically, as the royal commission found, had the most profound of human consequences.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast we have laid out before the House the sources of advice—the Productivity Commission, the reviews commissioned by the Gillard government and the department. We will simply have to disagree as to whether the Productivity Commission, the reviewers, including Allan Hawke, and the department are credible and authoritative sources of advice. We stand by all three of those sources. It is up to the opposition to reject them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental point here, which has been set out by the Productivity Commission and others—indeed, it is the latest advice that I have—is that scaling, whether it is the federal or state systems, will come through the insurance process itself. The more there are in one, the more it is scaled up. The fewer there are in others, the more it is scaled down. That is the simple answer. I repeat that the actuarial assessments commissioned by the Productivity Commission concluded that, the larger the employer, the closer the premium is to the true cost.</span>

Our position is clear and that is final. We are the party that has put in place safety measures. As the home insulation program showed, the previous government for, sadly, the worst of reasons took the worst of processes with the worst outcomes. That is my final word.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I offer the support of the opposition for the passage of this bill. The Customs Amendment Bill proposes a number of minor amendments to modernise and remove anomalies in the Customs Act, which provides an important update to these laws. Firstly, in terms of domestic travellers on international flights, the bill extends Customs' powers of examination to the bags of domestic travellers on international flights and voyages and domestic cargo on international flights and voyages. Currently Australia's Customs and Border Protection officers have powers to question all travellers, whether international or domestic, on a domestic leg of an international flight or voyage in relation to dutiable, excisable or prohibited goods. They can also conduct personal searches of travellers on international journeys, including domestic travellers on a domestic leg of international flights and voyages. However, they do not currently have the ability to examine the personal effects of domestic travellers and domestic cargo on an international flight or voyage. Domestic travellers on such journeys have the opportunity to mingle with international travellers during embarkation or disembarkation processes on the aircraft or on the ship and in transit lounges. The advice that was given to the opposition by the department is that this provides an opportunity for bag switches and the like if someone is seeking to break the law. This can occur before international travellers are cleared on arrival or after international travellers are cleared on departure. And this issue is particularly pressing for countries with a considerable land mass like Australia, which feature some cities some distances apart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These factors increase the prevalence of international flights that make numerous stops within our borders before making a leap overseas or, alternatively, flights returning to Australia from overseas making numerous stops once they are back in Australia. This ability to mingle at various stages presents a border risk as dutiable and prohibited goods can be transferred between domestic and international travellers to avoid detection by Customs and Border Protection staff. The mixing of domestic cargo and goods for export presents risks for diversion of cargo from one stream to another, especially prohibited goods or goods subject to border related duties and taxes. The new section proposed, section 186AA of the act, will provide Customs and Border Protection Service officers with the powers to examine that domestic cargo and the personal effects of domestic travellers who complete a domestic leg of an international flight or voyage. We also note that there is no intention to require domestic cargo to be reported. This is a positive development. It clears up an anomaly in the act and is something that we offer support for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends control to places where ships and aircraft arrive that are not proclaimed ports or airports. Currently certain ports are proclaimed under the Customs Act for arrivals purposes. The ship owner reports that the particular ship and cargo will arrive at a specific destination as designated under the act for checking by Customs and Border Protection staff. But with the growth in Australia's offshore resources and cruise ship industries, we have increasingly seen ships requiring to arrive from a place outside of Australia that is not a proclaimed port. In 2013 Australian cruise ship passenger numbers hit a record of 833,000, making Australia the world's leading cruise market in growth and market penetration. Australia's impressive 20 per cent growth in passenger numbers was more than double the rate achieved by any other key cruise market in 2013, with more ships deployed in local waters in 2014 than at any other time. And Australia's growth trajectory seems set to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the legislation currently stands, Customs do not have the power to control goods that arrive at unproclaimed ports under section 58 of the act. These amendments will extend Customs' control to correct that anomaly. Section 58 states that a master of a ship or a pilot of an aircraft must bring the ship or aircraft to a proclaimed port or airport unless suffering from stress of weather or other reasonable cause. Rather than requiring ships or aircraft to arrive at a proclaimed port or airport where border activities can be managed, the Customs and Border Protection Service will be able to manage risks and conduct necessary activities at places which are not proclaimed ports to provide equivalence of search and examination power. And definitions of a designated place and customs place will be amended in sub section 58(1) of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will standardise the application process for permissions to load and unload ships and aircraft stores, transfer goods between certain vessels and apply for certificates of clearance. The act sets out arrangements for permissions to be granted on several activities at wharves, airports or at sea—for instance, to load and unload ships and aircraft stores, to transfer goods between vessels and to make an application for a certificate of clearance before departure. Currently there is a lack of detail about the nature of these forms and what they must take. The amendments propose to introduce an approved form for such applications. These amendments will give consistency to reporting arrangements that allow for reporting to occur online, so it will simplify the process and make it much more user-friendly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of reporting arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and the reporting of stores and prohibited goods, the bill provides for amendments to provide greater flexibility to the CEO of Customs in dealing with reports of arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting stores and prohibited goods on such vessels and aircraft. Currently ships and aircraft that arrive in Australia must report to Australian Customs and Border Protection Service particulars of their arrival and of stores of any prohibited goods contained in those stores at the time of arrival—for instance, firearms and certain narcotics. These reports must be made in relation to the ship within 24 hours of a ship's arrival—disregarding weekends and public holidays—and within three hours of an aircraft's arrival. It has proved to be somewhat of a burden and an inconvenience particularly in respect of the arrival of ships. A ship may arrive at a designated port with prohibited stores on a Friday afternoon but will be unable to have those stores inspected and the appropriate measures put in place until the following Monday and in some circumstances the following Tuesday if it is a long weekend because of the operation of the act. This will simplify that process and make it much more user-friendly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reports are necessary for Customs and Border Protection staff to assess risks of items that may be on board and to establish a plan to deal with them especially, as I mentioned earlier, firearms and narcotics that may be required to be detained or managed in a certain way. These changes do not apply to cargo, only to stores and prohibited goods. These arrangements will allow for the CEO of Customs to specify by legislative instrument, which will be disallowable, when the reports must be made for different kinds of ships and aircraft in different circumstances. That will simplify that process and remove that anomaly that exists in respect of weekends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reports will be required to be made at a time that would be more appropriate to minimise impacts on the master or owner of the ship or the pilot or owner of the aircraft or that would enable the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to deal with the information in these reports at a more convenient time and to allow earlier assessment, prioritisation and efficient deployment of Customs and Border Protection resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the operation of infringement notices, the bill corrects a technical error in relation to the interaction of the Customs and Border Protection Service's Infringement Notice Scheme and claims process for seized goods under the act. In February 2014 a new infringement notice system in the act commenced. The infringement notice system allows for the issuing of an infringement notice for strict or absolute liability offences under the act, including imported prohibited items. But there is an unintended consequence of the new act that is not operating the way the act intended. Prohibited imports can also be seized under the act and are then dealt with under the claims process in division 1 of part XXII of the act. Since the commencement of the INS, a technical error has been identified relating to the condemnation of goods. The INS provides that goods that will be taken to be condemned to the crown if the goods are prohibited imports. The person pays a penalty under the INS and the INS is then subsequently withdrawn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the act, if a seizure notice is served a person has 30 days to make a claim for the return of the goods. And, pursuant to section 205C, if a claim for the return of the goods may be made and is not made within 30 days after the seizure notice is served then all goods are taken to be condemned and forfeited to the crown. However, a claim for the return of the goods may not be made if goods have been taken to be condemned as forfeited to the crown. The legal status of the goods is therefore complicated. If a seizure notice and an INS have been issued and the penalty in the INS has been paid but the INS is later withdrawn and the goods are condemned and forfeited to the crown, you cannot get them back, basically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will ensure a cleaner interaction with each other and with the operation of those provisions to correct this error. The changes will mean that the condemnation of the goods will not apply if an INS is withdrawn and will allow a person up to 30 days after the INS is withdrawn for the person to make a claim for the goods in circumstances where the goods have been seized and the seizure notice has been served, an INS for an offence in relation to the importation has been given, the penalty notice has been paid within the required time and the INS is therefore subsequently withdrawn. So, it clears up that anomaly that currently exists within the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill improves the administration and appointment of authorised officers by class under the Customs Act. There is currently no provision in the Acts Interpretation Act for statutory authorisations. The current provision only allows for the CEO of Customs to authorise a class of persons. The law remains unsettled as to whether an authorisation will apply to future officers or positions within an authorised class that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The amendments will change the definition of 'authorised officer' so that authorisations can apply to offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation to a class of offices is given. This is a clearing up of that anomaly that, again, exists in respect of authorised officers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this omnibus bill, proposing a number of minor amendments to the Customs Act, has been in the making for some time. It is important that we continue to refine our border protection measures through such bills as this to ensure that the broader Australian community is well protected and international and criminal enterprises are stopped from perpetrating our borders. This act and these amendments respond to a number of issues that have been identified by practitioners and by the owners and operators in the cruise ship industry particularly. It improves the operation of the bill, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment Bill 2014 and follow on from the member for Kingsford Smith, and I thank him for his support for the bill. Every Australian has an inherent expectation to be safe and protected in their homes and in the community. We have this expectation, which ultimately goes hand in hand with our expectation that those who are tasked with or select the job of enabling this protection are being provided with the appropriate powers and mechanisms to do so effectively and efficiently. In our community this level of protection varies between a number of different tiers, from our volunteer Neighbourhood Watch to the different levels and organisations within our state and federal police forces. At our borders, however, we have a different organisation altogether—our Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officers—who are tasked with protecting the safety of every Australian from prohibited air and sea cargo, protecting us while we travel both domestically and internationally, and protecting personal luggage or cargo when people are trying to enter our country or travel within it with prohibited items.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past year the coalition government has worked with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to identify those areas where officers' powers need to be enhanced and legislative areas that need to be amended or have additional provisions inserted to support officers' ability to appropriately protect our borders and ensure everything that can be done is being done to protect the safety of every Australian. We have introduced vital amendments and new provisions in this place to effectively respond to the very real threat that Australia is facing to its national security both from home-grown terrorism and from those who seek to enter our country to harm us. We have also introduced a number of amendments and provisions with respect to Australia's Migration Act, which will work with many of the proposed measures in the bill before the House today to ensure that our borders are protected from illegal maritime and air arrivals. In many of these measures our Customs and Border Protection officers' powers have been reviewed, and in some cases expanded, to reflect concerns from officers and from the government that the current legislative provisions do not afford them with the powers they need to protect our borders to the best of their ability. Many of these proposed changes to date have been technical in nature to reflect the need to better streamline such things as reporting requirements or to expand officers' ability or the ability of the responsible minister to assess the risk that particular circumstances pose to the community and how these can be better responded to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every member in this place would understand the importance of our Customs and Border Protection officers' role and would understand that no person knows the areas where practices could be better streamlined or provisions enhanced than those who are on the ground responding to these instances. That is one of the reasons why I recently welcomed the opportunity to join with the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon. Michaelia Cash, at Perth International Airport's Customs House to see firsthand how our Customs and Border Protection officers are working to keep every Australian safe and to understand the scope of prohibited items that organised crime syndicates in particular try to smuggle through our borders every day. I also note that that particularly Immigration and Border Protection office at Perth International Airport's Customs House is in my electorate of Swan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From January to October this year alone, over 12 kilograms of methamphetamine, also known as ice; 1.5 tonnes of molasses tobacco and over 2,000 prohibited weapons, including firearms knuckledusters, automatic knives and laser pointers have been seized from air cargo by Perth's Customs officers. This is a significant achievement by officers, as many of these items were expertly concealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not, however, always our Customs officers who detect these prohibited items. Our officers and this government take great pride in the abilities of our detector dogs, who contributed to the detection of almost 2,379 illicit imports and exports in 2012-13. It is because the coalition government is one which recognises the importance of such programs and listens to our departments' views about those areas they believe to be lacking or in need or additional support that, in February this year, the government committed $88 million of additional funding to Australia's Customs and Border Protection measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This significant funding commitment was specifically focused on increasing screening of international mail and air and sea cargo, while an additional $8.5 million was also committed to expand our Detector Dog Program. In Perth alone, this funding boost has provided for an increase in inspections of 250,000 mail articles and 50,000 air-cargo consignments and has prevented a range of prohibited items from arriving on our streets and in our communities. It has also provided an additional 15 detector dog teams to support the increased inspection and examination of cargo across Australia, including three detector dog teams in my home town of Perth. They are now receiving world-class training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2014-15 budget, we also committed a further $480.5 million over a four year package to bolster the enforcement capabilities of Australia's Strategic Border Command, intelligence systems, trade and travel systems and workforce measures and training. By making these significant funding commitments and introducing legislative amendments in this place, the coalition is ensuring our Customs and Border Protection officers have the appropriate powers to do their jobs effectively. We are being proactive in responding to the ongoing threat to Australia's national security. We could turn away and hide our heads in the sand with the attitude that everything will be okay, but we are a government of reality and we are government which accepts and responds appropriately to our responsibility to protect every Australian and our assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Customs Amendment Bill 2014, which is before the House today, seeks to amend the Customs Act 1901 to extend the powers of Customs officers, make technical amendments to better streamline the act's provisions and correct a technical error in the legislation. Key provisions will therefore be amended or added, with the focus of these measures being in regards to current differences between Customs officers examination powers in relation to domestic travellers on a flight or voyage to that of international travellers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I highlight the proposed amendments to Customs powers, I will first outline a number of technical amendments that are proposed in the bill. The first technical amendment is in relation to the definition of an authorised officer. Currently, the act precludes authorisations by the chief executive officer of Customs applying to any offices or positions which come into existence after the authorisation to a class of offices is given. The proposed amendment seeks to amend this definition to extend such authorisations to an office or a position that comes into existence after the authorisation is given. While this amendment is largely technical in nature, a key proposed amendment in the bill before the House seeks to address an identified vulnerability in our Customs control for goods on ships and aircrafts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, all goods on board a ship or aircraft are subject to Customs control while the ship or aircraft is within the limits of any port or ship in Australia. There are, however, a number of incidences where a ship or aircraft may go to a place other than a port or airport, including when there is bad weather or permission has been granted. An example of an industry where this regularly occurs in Australia is for those industries involved in resource activities who request permission to bring vessels directly to an offshore installation. In these instances, the goods on the ship or aircraft are not subject to Customs control and can therefore not be examined by Customs officers. The bill before the House seeks to rectify this vulnerability in our Customs control orders by amending the definition of a 'designated place' to include a place where a ship or aircraft has been brought under stress by weather or other reasonable cause to ensure that Customs officers are able to exercise certain seizure, detention and personal search powers. Further amendments will also be made in relation to the reporting of goods on board these ships or aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the act's current provisions, an international ship that arrives in Australia must report the particulars of their arrival to Customs within 24 hours of the ship's arrival or before the issue of certificate of clearance, while an aircraft report must be made within three hours. These same time frames also apply to a ship's stores, an aircraft's stores and prohibited goods reports. These time frames are currently posing difficulties for Customs officers to effectively and efficiently process ships and aircraft when the particulars of their goods are not known.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the bill's explanatory memorandum states, in most instances Customs Officers will conduct:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…physical boarding and intervention activities of ships and aircraft at the time of arrival at the first port or airport in Australia. However in some circumstances, it would be beneficial for ACBPS to be notified of particulars of the stores and prohibited goods including firearms, weapons and narcotics, before the arrival of the ship or aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To respond to these difficulties, the bill before the House proposes to amend the Customs Act by inserting additional provisions which allow the CEO to specify when a report must be made for certain ships or aircraft. This will effectively allow different reporting time frames to be provided for different circumstances and will enable Customs officers to appropriately assess the risk of such goods prior to their arrival in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before a ship then departs, a certificate of clearance must be provided by the collector. Under the act's current provisions, an application must be made to the collector in writing and must contain a series of regulatory information that is outlined in the act. This method of reporting is, however, inconsistent with other application and reporting requirements. This bill seeks to rectify this by amending the provisions to ensure that reporting requirements are streamlined across this act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A series of amendments will therefore be made, including (a) removing the requirement for the regulations to prescribe particulars for an application for the certificate of clearance; (b) requiring applications to be made in writing, in an approved form, contain such information as the form requires and be signed in the manner indicated in the form; and (c) allowing the CEO to approve different forms for applications to be made in different circumstances, by the different kinds of masters or owners of ships or pilots or owners of aircraft, or in respect of different kinds of ships or aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further technical amendments will also be made with regard to the content requirements for goods to be unloaded or used before the departure of a ship or aircraft, to clarify when the consent must be sought from a collector and in what form. Under the proposed amendments, the application process will be standardised in line with the proposed changes to other reporting requirements, such as those I previously outlined with regard to applications for a certificate of clearance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the act does not currently contain any provisions which detail how to apply for permission to transfer goods between certain vessels and what form these applications must take. Again, the bill before the House will rectify the current lapse in the act and will streamline its provisions with other outlined application processes to ensure there is consistency, with the eventual aim of these permissions to be applied for online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned earlier, although there are a number of technical amendments being made in this bill, there are also a number of key legislative changes, which will respond to the current vulnerabilities in Australia's customs and border protection measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As all members in this place would be aware from their own travels, domestic travellers often mix with international travellers prior to, during and after the domestic leg of a flight or voyage. An example of this would be when one plane, which is being used to travel from a country outside of Australia such as China, arrives in Melbourne and continues on to Perth. Under the act's current provisions, domestic cargo can be loaded and unloaded from this aircraft when it arrives in Melbourne without any authority or permission; however, this domestic cargo and the personal effects of domestic travellers are not currently subject to Customs control once they are loaded or unloaded. Only the goods of international passengers would fall under the control of Customs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House, therefore, seeks to amend the act to provide that domestic goods on international flights or voyages can be examined by an officer of Customs in the same manner as goods on a purely international flight and voyage with no domestic stop-overs. These additional examination powers would apply to goods which have been loaded onto a ship or aircraft, and those which have been unloaded. An additional measure will be inserted into the act in this regard to provide that the expense of any examination under these new powers is borne by the owner of the goods. As stated in the bill's explanatory memorandum, it is expected that this would 'mainly be applicable in the cargo environment as opposed to the traveller environment'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stated earlier, this Customs Amendment Bill also seeks to correct a technical error in the legislation in relation to a new infringement notice scheme which commenced on 1 February this year. This scheme allows for the issuing of an infringement notice in relation to strict- or absolute-liability offences. The technical error that has been identified is in the interaction of this infringement notice with the claims process when dealing with prohibited imports. When an infringement notice is issued under this scheme, the person to whom the notice has been issued is given the option to pay the fine specified in the notice, or they may choose to have the offence heard by a court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the provisions in the scheme, if a person opts to pay the fine and the infringement notice is not withdrawn, the prohibited goods are condemned as forfeited to the crown and, as a result, cannot be claimed. In these circumstances, where a claim can be made it must be made within 30 days of a seizure notice being issued. A problem, however, arises between these two requirements, in these instances, when a fine or penalty has been paid and the infringement notice is later withdrawn. An issue arises because the time frame for making this claim may have expired—it may be past the required 30 days. The proposed amendments will rectify this issue by inserting a provision that will allow a person to have 30 days after the withdrawal of an infringement notice to make a claim for their seized goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although many of the amendments in this bill are technical in nature, this does not detract from their importance in bolstering Australia's overall customs and border protection measures and ensuring that every Australian is protected to the best of this government's and our agencies' abilities. They are important amendments and provisions to ensure appropriate powers are afforded to our Customs officers and identified vulnerabilities are swiftly responded to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I acknowledge the support of the member for Kingsford Smith and the opposition for this bill. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I rise to speak in this debate on the Customs Amendment Bill 2014. I support this bill because it strengthens our customs framework, which I believe is vitally important. Given my former role as a police officer, I am very pleased to be speaking on bills such as this that strengthen frameworks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Customs Act 1901. The bill consists of six measures which seek to improve the customs framework that is in place. Fundamentally, this bill will, firstly, extend the control of Customs to places where ships and aircraft arrive that are not proclaimed ports or airports. It will standardise the application process for permissions to load and unload ship and aircraft stores. It will also standardise the process for the transferring of goods between certain vessels and applications for a certificate of clearance. It will also provide greater flexibility to the CEO of Customs in dealing with the reports of the arrival of ships and aircrafts into Australia, and reporting stores and prohibited goods on vessels and aircraft. It will extend Customs's powers of examination to the bags of domestic travellers on international flights and voyages, and domestic cargo on international flights and voyages, which is also very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also correct a technical error in relation to the interaction of Customs and Border Protection's infringement notice scheme and claims process for seized goods under the act; and it also improves the administration of the appointment of authorised officers by class under the Customs Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to goods on ships, currently, only certain shipping ports are proclaimed, or defined, for arrival purposes under the Customs Act 1901. Due to the ongoing growth in Australia's offshore resources and cruise ship industries, ships have increasingly had to arrive from a place outside of Australia at a place that is not defined as a proclaimed port. The bill before the House will provide that all goods on board any ship or aircraft from a place outside of Australia are subject to Customs control while the ship or aircraft is within the limits of any port or airport in Australia. The bill will rectify any ongoing issues of a passenger or freight ship arriving at a port which is not proclaimed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the act does not allow for Customs control to goods which are on board a ship or aircraft at a place other than a port or airport in Australia to which a ship or aircraft has been brought because of stress of weather or other reasonable cause under subsection 58(1) of the act, or the master of a ship or the pilot of an aircraft has received permission from a collector to bring the ship or aircraft under subsection 58(2) of the act. This means that currently Customs officers cannot inspect goods on board a ship or aircraft which has arrived in these circumstances. The proposed section 58 of the bill currently before the House will address these issues. Section 58 states that a master of a ship or a pilot of an aircraft must bring the ship or aircraft to a proclaimed port or airport, unless suffering from stress of weather or other reasonable cause. Rather than require ships or aircraft to arrive at a proclaimed port or airport where border activities can be managed, the Customs service will be able to manage risks and conduct necessary activities at a place which is not a proclaimed port. However, to allow for ships and planes which had not been able to arrive at a proclaimed port or airport, this bill will also modify the definitions of a 'designated place' and 'Customs place' so as to provide equivalence of search and examination powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes changes to the regulation of arrival reports and certificates of clearance. Fundamentally, these amendments are aimed at clearing up a range of inconsistencies. As it stands, ships and aircraft that arrive in Australia from a place outside Australia must report to Customs services the particulars of their arrival and of stores, and any prohibited goods contained in those stores at the time of arrival. The bill ensures that these reports must be made in relation to a ship within 24 hours of the ship's arrival, or for aircraft within three hours of arrival. These reports are vital for Customs to be able to assess risks of items that may be on board and to establish the most practical way to deal with them—for example, it may be items such as firearms or narcotics that may be required to be detained or managed in a particular way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will allow the CEO of Customs to specify by legislative instrument when the reports must be made for different kinds of ships and aircraft or in different circumstances. Reports will be required to be made at a time that would be more appropriate to minimise impacts on the owner of the ship or pilot or owner of the aircraft. This would enable Customs to deal with the information in these reports at a more convenient time to allow earlier assessment, prioritisation and efficient deployment of their resources, which is vital to take into consideration. However, it is important to recognise that these changes do not apply to cargo but apply only to stores and prohibited goods. The amendments contained in this bill will allow for greater security and protection of our citizens in Australia in and near our port structures and will remedy the inconsistencies in the reporting structure. Overall, these measures do move towards strengthening our systems within the Customs framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the Certificate of Clearance, the act sets a regulatory regime to enable permission to be granted for some activities at wharves, at airports or at sea. Activities regulated in this manner can include loading and unloading the stores of ships and aircrafts, transferring goods between vessels, or making an application for a Certificate of Clearance before departure. However, at present, the regulatory regime does not provide great detail as to the nature of the necessary formalities. As a result, items 12 to 16 in the bill propose to amend section 118 to remove the requirement for the regulations to prescribe particulars for an application for the Certificate of Clearance. It also requires applications to be made in writing, on an approved form, containing such information as the form requires, and be signed in the manner indicated in the form. It also does the allow the CEO to approve different forms for applications to be made in different circumstances, by different kinds of masters or owners of ships or pilots or owners of aircraft, or in respect of different kinds of ships or aircraft. Through these proposed amendments, an 'approved form' for such applications will be introduced, which will give consistency to reporting arrangements and, very importantly, allow for reporting to occur online. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the measures that I have outlined, this bill will also seek to enhance the interaction of the Infringement Notice Scheme, with the claims processing under the Customs Act in relation to prohibited imports. Since the commencement of the Infringement Notice Scheme earlier this year, a technical error has been identified relating to prohibited imports. The legislation currently provides that, where goods are deemed to be prohibited imports, they will be taken to be condemned to the Crown. The person then pays a penalty under an Infringement Notice Scheme, and the Infringement Notice Scheme is then subsequently withdrawn. However, at present, if a seizure notice is served, a person has 30 days to make a claim for return of the goods and, if a claim for the return of the goods has not been made within 30 days of the service of such a seizure notice, the goods will be taken to be condemned as forfeited to the Crown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, pursuant to section 205B(1A) of the act, a claim for the return of goods may not be made if goods deemed to be prohibited imports have already been taken to be condemned as forfeited to the Crown. Therefore, the legal status of the goods is somewhat contradictory in the event that both a seizure notice has been served and an Infringement Notice Scheme has been issued and the penalty in the Infringement Notice Scheme has been paid and is later withdrawn. The current amendments will ensure a much 'cleaner' interaction with each other. Correcting this error is indeed a very positive step. The changes will mean that the condemnation of goods will not apply if an Infringement Notice Scheme is withdrawn and will allow a person up to 30 days after the notice is withdrawn for the person to make a claim for the goods in circumstances where the goods have been seized, a seizure notice has been served, an Infringement Notice Scheme for an offence in relation to the importation of the goods has been given, the penalty has been paid within the required time, and the Infringement Notice Scheme has been subsequently withdrawn. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now come to what I believe is the most important part of these measures in terms of the extension of Customs powers. As I said at the beginning, as a former police officer, I am supportive of these measures. When we are looking at any sorts of pre-emptive and preventative measures, they are of course always much more preferable to reactive measures. It is why I think some of the changes in this legislation are very positive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, that is why those of us on this side are supporting the amendments contained within this bill, particularly those regarding the inspection of domestic cargo and personal effects. At present on a domestic leg of an international flight or voyage customs officers have the power to question all travellers, whether they are international or domestic travellers, in relation to dutiable, excisable or prohibited goods. They can also undertake personal searches of travellers on international journeys, including domestic travellers, but at present customs officers do not have the ability to examine the personal effects of domestic travellers and domestic cargo on an international flight or voyage. As it currently stands this has the capacity to pose a security risk, as domestic travellers on international flights or voyages have the opportunity to liaise with other international travellers during the embarkation or disembarkation process. In some cases this can occur before international travellers are cleared on arrival or after international travellers are cleared on departure and so could pose a security risk because dutiable and prohibited goods could potentially be transferred between domestic and international travellers so as to intentionally evade detection by customs officers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another problem that can occur in these circumstances is the mixing of domestic cargo with imported goods or goods for export. At its most fundamental, this presents a risk for the diversion of cargo from one stream to another and so may evade regulation of prohibited goods or goods subject to border related duties and taxes. However, with the amendments proposed in this bill, custom officers will now, quite rightly, be equipped with powers to examine domestic cargo and the personal effects of domestic travellers who complete the domestic leg of an international flight or voyage. In conclusion I believe that the reforms proposed in this bill are very positive, and Labor supports these moves and moves that improve the security and protection of Australians at home and abroad. This bill and its amendments are fundamentally aimed at achieving this goal. I support this bill and commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250077" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VARVARIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I am very pleased to speak in favour of the Customs Amendment Bill 2014, which amends the Customs Act in a number of minor ways to streamline, extend and enhance the way that our customs personnel are able to operate at the border. It goes without saying that our Australian Customs personnel do an indispensable job in maintaining the security of our borders. Whether it is preventing the flow of illicit drugs, minimising losses to revenue—due to smuggling and revenue evasion—protecting industry from non-compliant importers or improving the security of our sea cargo trade, our customs personnel ensure that Australia retains control over its own borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Howard Government we saw a gold standard of customs and border protection at work. Significant improvements included the establishment of the Border Protection Command in 2004, increased funding for the Customs Service by 180 per cent, the more efficient processing of arriving international passengers and new drug-detection dog teams all across Australia. Key performance indicators, such as the inspection rate for air cargo consignments, were at a strong 60 per cent. Over the span of the Rudd and Gillard years, these figures dropped dramatically to less than 5 per cent of air cargo consignments inspected. Other figures saw a similar drop, with percentage of sea cargo inspections down to 3.5 per cent from 5.7 per cent and physical examinations of sea cargo down to 0.5 per cent from 0.6 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is determined to pick up where the Howard government left off by restoring customs management to a high standard and making progress on key performance indicators. The decline in the rate of air and sea cargo inspections was one of the most significant and damaging legacies left to our customs performance by the previous government, as it meant that irregular and criminal elements were more likely to slip through the cracks of the customs net, especially as the volume of incoming cargo was projected to rise. At a time when their responsibilities were most demanding, the previous government cut 700 employees from customs services. At a time when our borders faced some of the most significant challenges we have seen in recent times, budgetary cuts of $734.8 million were made, the effects of which will continue to be felt out to 2017-18.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts to the customs cargo-screening program meant that our rate of sea cargo inspections plummeted, leaving our borders less secure because our customs teams were inadequately resourced. This led to an incident in 2012 when 220 Glock pistols were intercepted on Australian soil, not by the customs services, but by the New South Wales Police Force. This was a concerning incident which exposed the holes in front-line services as a result of a deficiency of Commonwealth funding. Reductions in resources, funding and jobs in the area of Customs and Border Protection reflected the misguided priorities at work in the mindset of the previous government. When there are holes in vital front-line services that the Commonwealth funds at our nation's borders, we expose our nation to a greater risk—the risk posed to the community and law-abiding industry by smugglers and crime syndicates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will ensure that future officers and positions, which come into existence after class based authorisations is given, are allowed, and this will save significant legislative work into the future. This legislation will work to resolve blind spots in our customs activities, extending control to the ports where ships and aircraft arrive—places which may not currently be subject to any customs checks. Greater flexibility in reporting the arrival of ships and aircraft will mean that our custom officers will be able to extend their jurisdiction to all excursions that carry cargo or goods into Australia. The changes brought about by these amendments will ensure that the reporting and inspection mechanisms within the Customs Act are consistent, modern and flexible so that our customs personnel will have an expanded capacity to manage the risks posed to our border security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the streamlined Australian Border Force, announced in May of this year, is proof positive of the forward-thinking approach of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and his department. Furthermore, under the Abbott government, immigration and customs have been combined into a single cabinet portfolio which has permanent status on the National Security Committee of cabinet. The recently announced funding increase of $630 million to law enforcement and border protection industries is a resounding sign that this government has got its priorities straight when it comes to strengthening the capable work being done at our borders. The Australian Border Force will re-invest the budget savings, which we make in combining Customs and Border Protection responsibilities into a single force, back into the front-line of customs activities—exactly where the resources need to flow to reach key performance indicators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the coalition's focus is extending and enhancing our border protection capabilities, rather than rein them in. By streamlining areas where we need greater efficiency and investing in areas where we need an increase in resources, jobs and capacities, the government is bringing a smart and tailored approach to this portfolio for the sake of our border integrity. Just as Howard left office confident that our house was in order and that he had kept the people of Australia safe from the compromise of our borders, I am confident that our work in this place will aspire to the very same standards and even exceed them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One way in which we are building on the success and innovations of the Howard government is in technological update. Our customs processes are moving with the developments of the 21st century, as applications permissions under the act will be able to be completed online. These amendments will ensure that our customs capabilities advance and refine into the information age. We are determined to deliver results in the sphere of customs and border protection. I am proud to be part of a team who has acted on its word, restoring order on our borders and heeding the will of the Australian people. Our priority is to ensure that our capable Customs and Border Protection personnel have the resources and legislative provisions that they require to do their job to the best of their ability. We want to see an Australia in which sea and air cargo are regularly inspected, in which passengers are facilitated with the utmost efficiency and in which criminal syndicates are met with vigilance and disruption at our border. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is commendable in the action it takes to resolve customs blind spots, such as those places where ships and aircraft regularly arrive in Australia which are not officially proclaimed ports or airports. International flights and voyages will also have domestic legs of their trip eligible for customs checks. This will extend Customs presence and control to these areas, ensuring that fewer blind spots exist that can become an advantage for those who would compromise the integrity of our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Barton is a particular stakeholder to the security and efficiency of our port districts and airports. Almost totally surrounded by waterways, including Botany Bay, and immediately adjoined by Sydney Airport to the east, Barton is interconnected with our federal port and customs networks. Notably, Port Botany immediately adjoins my electorate of Barton and holds a strong relevance for the people and industries within my electorate.  In 2012-13 alone, 2.1 million containers were traded through the port across both import and export operations. Clearly the people and businesses of Barton stand to gain from maritime security at our ports, as well as a robust system of inspection and screening at our major airports. According to New South Wales Ports' executive summary for 2012-13, import quantities continue to rise on average four per cent per year through the port, as volume of cargo reliably increases at ports all around Australia. This cements our understanding that, when the volume of cargo consignments and passengers coming through our air and sea ports increases, our Customs authorities must be given corresponding increases in resources to maintain their standards of professionalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line in regard to this legislation is that we are moving steadily towards the gold standard of border protection that was at work under the leadership of the Howard government. This bill demonstrates that the priority of this government is to keep our people safe and never to surrender control of our borders. It maintains appropriate safeguards in the interests of privacy and simplicity of travel, while making the security of our borders a priority. And, indeed, it acts on the understanding that the first priority of government is to keep our people safe—to resolve blind spots and to extend our professionalism, efficiency and vigilance in the cause of maintaining and strengthening the integrity of our borders. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DYN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr JENSEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 makes a number of amendments to the Customs Act aimed at increasing Australian Border Security and Customs powers. While these changes are rather technical and minor, it would be wrong to assume this bill is somehow insignificant or less important than others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the Customs Act does not contain the provisions that customs agents require to fully carry out their duties. This is not the fault of any party or person but rather a technical oversight that we now must fix. Through due diligence, this government has identified where the legislative holes are and has dedicated itself to ameliorative action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One technical issue that this bill will resolve relates to the crossover between domestic and international flights and voyages. Currently, customs agents do not have the powers to search the baggage of domestic travellers on international flights. Nor can they examine domestic cargo on international flights. This is problematic as passengers often travel domestically on a leg of an international flight. These passengers are mixed with international travellers; their baggage goes in the same storage. This is further problematic as Customs officials lack the powers to search and examine baggage on flights or voyages that arrive in places other than proclaimed ports and airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these loopholes provide opportunities for those who want to avoid Customs officials to exchange goods with other travellers. This creates numerous problems for authorities, each serious in their own way. Airports and docks are supposed to be sterile environments in every sense of the word. Anything that can be done to ensure the high standards of quarantine in this country must be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First and foremost, we must ensure that all items coming and going are essentially clean and free of any pests or diseases that may be dangerous to our ecosystem. We all know of the importance of biosecurity. Our diverse ecosystem, our stunning landscapes and our bountiful agriculture all depend on biosecurity. Stopping potentially harmful material from entering the country is the backbone of preserving these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill serves to improve our defences in two ways. First of all, with these measures, customs agents will be able to carry out their duties at places where ships and aircraft often arrive in Australia that would otherwise not be proclaimed ports or airports. Ships and aircraft land in areas that fall outside the current regulations for numerous reasons. Cruise ships, for example, can often land in non-proclaimed areas. Both vessels and aircraft can land in non-proclaimed areas due to weather as well. Numerous other exceptions also apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also relates to security of the general kind. For every time I mention biosecurity, my point would still ring true if I discussed security generally instead. It is our ability to regulate what comes in and out of our country that grants us the protective shield against prohibited items such as firearms and narcotics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know of the dangers our country now faces given our escalated security climate. The savage advance of the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East underlines the seriousness of it all. We know that this terror risk has already come to our shores. We know dozens if not hundreds of Australians have joined jihadist groups overseas. We know they have fought, killed and died. Some have even returned to Australia, bringing back their terrorist know-how and bloodlust to our streets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will be able to give our Customs agents the power they need to better control the entry points for goods. Currently, the opportunity exists for those intending to smuggle prohibited items, firearms perhaps, into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is well known that this government is committed to restoring the country's finances and getting the budget back on track. This involves both cutting costs and raising revenue. The Australian government went to the previous election with the solemn promise that the necessary decisions would be made in order to get the country back in the black. After six years of Labor, the task is unsurprisingly large, but by no means insurmountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does more than anything else is send a very clear and strong message to the Australian public, and those intending to try their luck, that this government is serious about law and order. The government has, over the last 15 months, consistently brought forward legislation to significantly strengthen the hand of Customs officials. Our commitment to defending the homeland, and thwarting those who seek to do us ill or undermine our rule of law, is resolute. This resolution has not only been confined to financial support, though we have increased the allocations in this regard. Innovation and vision are also a feature of what this government is doing in the customs space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take for example the announced Border Force. This will represent a new departure for both the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, and Customs. This is logical. It is a holistic approach that seeks to utilise to best effect every bit of acquired expertise and experience available to the Commonwealth. The days of agencies not being in sync is coming to an end. The right hand will know what left hand is doing. This measure, due to come into effect on 1 July 2015, is timely and benchmarks against international best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crime and criminality, like any industry, are evolving and becoming ever more complex and sophisticated. We need a government of ideas, commitment and vision. I am pleased to report to this House that in the Abbott government, and in Minister Morrison in particular, we have such leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing but not surprising that even on an issue of national importance such as the reform and strengthening of border protection agencies, the Labor Party cannot take a 'Team Australia' approach. Labor run scare stories and feed fantasies to the media about tensions, factions, and leadership tilts inside the cabinet. As if describing their own sorry story of government, they make up any old thing—just destructive and negative. The Australian people are sick and tired of that same old relentless negativity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people and drug smugglers know fact from fiction, and it is as simple as this: the coalition is tough on crime and even tougher on the criminals. There are no bleeding hearts here. Our side cares about the results and doing whatever it takes to keep our streets clean from the scourge of drugs and keep our country safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though the particular bill under discussion is not a revolutionary piece of legislation, it is important. Important in the specific but also in the general. In the specific, tightening up and closing down loopholes is critical to keep ahead of the crims. In the general, it adds to a growing mountain of bills that this government have brought forward to strengthen the hand of our law enforcement officers. It clearly shows our commitment to keep our promise to the Australian people to stop the boats and secure our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It really boils down to a question of who did we make legislation for: the criminals or the law abiding citizens? Too often Labor, and particularly the Greens, will loll between lambasting the government and putting out a dirge, all for the benefit of the innocent criminal. Let me tell them that there is no such thing as an ordinary, decent criminal. There is always a victim. The popular notion that some crimes and drugs are harmless is one of the most insidious and damaging fallacies circulating in our community. It must be put to bed for good. Illegal drugs are illegal for a reason, and our reasons are the health and wellbeing of the Australian public. Similarly, when this bill expands the eligible search zone and area for Customs officials at ports and airports, there really should be no restrictions on search zones at airports and ports.</span>

The problem we face is that a terrorist could be anyone, and that terrorist need only be lucky once. We need to be lucky every time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There cannot be anyone of sane and sound mind in this place who could argue against putting our domestic passenger and freight arrangements on the same footing as our international ones. Likewise, this bill extends common sense to the area of where ships dock. If a ship docks outside a designated port or major shipping point it will be open to the same level of checking. There are practical measures that address lacunas in the current legislation. It is not insignificant, as the volume of passenger and commercial ferries increases daily. Their cargo of people and products should be eligible to be checked if docked at a non-major shipping port. This bill makes the case. The cruise ship industry regularly seeks permission to visit non-proclaimed areas on the Australian coastline. Industries involved in offshore resource activities do not utilise traditional port facilities, and often seek permission to bring vessels direct to an offshore installation.

Remittance services have been a very important aspect of the banking system for some years. These services allow many communities to send money back to families in developing nations that often do not have established banking networks, or modern forms of electronic fund transfer capabilities. It needs to be understood that the payment of remittances is not simply some birthday present or bonus payment that communities try to send from time to time—it goes to the core of people looking after their families and why they go to work each day. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written to the finance minister asking that the government take action on this. It is important to these communities in Australia that we find a way for remittance services to be resumed. There are occasions when specific transactions can and should be stopped for national security reasons, but to stop all remittance services in the manner that has occurred pushes many hardworking Australians into a circumstance where they cannot help people who are from their family who are completely reliant on that help. This has been a big issue in my electorate. Earlier this week in Canberra I met with representatives of the Somali community in Melbourne. It is within the grasp and the gift of the government to work with the banks and have this issue fixed.</span>

That was 100 years ago. I thank the Prime Minister for giving me the honour of representing him and the Australian government at the 100th anniversary commemoration. There were two main events, being the 8 November opening of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Emden</span> Gazebo on Direction Island, which I conducted with His Excellency Sir Peter Cosgrove, the Governor General, and the 9 November official memorial service at the new <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Emden</span> Memorial on West Island.</span>

Amber and her team did an excellent job. I also thank and congratulate Lieutenant Commander Desmond Woods, the Navy Staff Officer for the Centenary of ANZAC. He did a great job with the planning of the commemorative service on 9 November. I also thank the entire population of the Cocos Islands, West and Home islands, for their wonderful hospitality and the manner in which they added to this nationally important commemoration. I also acknowledge Rear Admiral retired Henning Bess and the members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Emden</span> family, descendants of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Emden</span> crew, who came from Germany to participate, and the family members descendent from the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> crew, along with other visitors involved in the commemoration.</span>

I did so in partnership with Denis Nelthorpe of the Wyndham Community Legal Centre. I was pleased to welcome shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus as a keynote speaker. The forum was an opportunity for the Wyndham Legal Service, the Footscray Community Legal Service and various community leaders and stakeholders to come together to discuss the issue of discrimination faced by many groups and their avenues to access justice, and the impact discrimination has on people's lives—discrimination in workplaces, in schools and in the broader community based on race, religion, gender and age. We heard from various speakers including Hon. Mark Dreyfus, Catherine Dow from the Footscray Community Legal Service and Melanie Schleiger from Legal Aid Victoria. It gave us an insight into the very important work that these legal services provide in case work and in advocacy. A highlight of the forum was a discussion on the differing power and effectiveness of case law compared to advocacy in educating the broader community. </span>

Those who live in Victoria, and northern Victoria in particular, will remember the lies and broken promises about not taking water from the north of the state to the south of the state, only to see the previous Labor government in Victoria introduce the North-South Pipeline. Water is wealth, and when you take it from the north where it grows food and send it to Melbourne you are robbing northern Victoria. I see the same people are now wanting to take over government again, and they are choosing to spend their money on 50 rail crossings in the city instead of committing to the Murray Basin rail link, which will be very important if we are going to take our high-value agricultural products to the market and to the world. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask that all northern Victorians think long and hard about whether they want to put a terrible, corrupt government back into power under Mr Andrews, if he is able to form government in a number of days, and to remember that they have been betrayed once and from everything we have seen in the election commitments so far they are going to be betrayed again. Daniel Andrews has not visited my part of the world, northern Victoria, since March 2013. Let us not vote for them on Saturday.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This award was presented in Canberra on Monday and I am very proud to be speaking about it today. Well done to WHGNE executive officer Susie Reid and her team for this innovative and critical work. It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the research done in the wake of the February 2009 bushfires. These fires had a huge impact on Indi, through Murrindindi, Indigo and Alpine shires.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  The 2014 National Disability Awards were presented last night at a gala event hosted by the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Mitch Fifield, at the Great Hall here in Parliament House. It was a terrific opportunity to honour the work that is being done for people with disability every day—the sort of work that sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most inspiring stories told last night was the work of Saronbell, a business based in North Gosford in my electorate on the New South Wales Central Coast. Last night Saronbell was awarded joint winner in the category of improving employment opportunities—a fantastic achievement. Run by an outstanding business couple, Ron and Sandra Mussalli, Saronbell has, since 2010, employed over 200 people with disability at McDonald's restaurants across the coast. Its ongoing relationship with Job Centre Australia has now made it the largest employer of people with disability on the coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I called Ron this morning to pass on my warmest congratulations to him, Sandra and the team, because they set a great example of what can be achieved when dedicated and passionate organisations in our local communities work towards a brighter future for people with disabilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the International Day of People with Disability being held next Wednesday, the awards are indeed well-timed. So well done to Saronbell and the other nine winners from last night for the inspiring work you do in helping people with disability and creating a better future, more hope and opportunity.</span>

The Yarra Valley Italian Cultural Group organised an event to both commemorate and celebrate some history. They met with large numbers from the community at the Lilydale cemetery, where they had a service and unveiled plaques for four Italians who had come to the Yarra Valley many decades ago and tragically died working in the Yarra Valley. They included workers who had worked on the Silvan Dam in the 1920s.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, they also wanted to celebrate the contribution of the Italian community to the Yarra Valley over all the decades. It is well known that many Italians came to the Yarra Valley, as they did to other parts of Australia, in the postwar years. They wanted to tell that story, but also the story that is not so well known of the contribution from the 1880s until today. In telling those stories, they have reminded everyone in the community of the wonderful contribution made to the Yarra Valley and the wonderful contribution that, we all know, will be made in the decades ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Last week I and many members of the community in Brisbane said goodbye to a long-term stalwart of the public sector union, 'Big Al' Lucre, who unfortunately recently passed away. Al was someone who stood up for working people his entire life, and I know that he would want me to continue to stand up for working people here in this place, particularly the many thousands of jobs lost from Queensland's public sector since the 2012 state election in which the Newman government took power. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before that election, they said that the public service had nothing to fear from a Newman government; that there would be no cuts to front-line services. Since the election, what have we seen? We have seen the Treasurer, Mr Nicholls, telling parliament that a real job is in the private sector—implying that if you are in the public sector you are not in a real job, which is terribly insulting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 14,000 jobs lost in the public sector in Queensland, or more if you believe some of the reports. Despite the promise before the election that there would be a four per cent unemployment rate within four years, unemployment in Queensland is now seven per cent seasonally adjusted, which is an absolute crying shame. Right to information requests by the nurses union have revealed that 4,821 health jobs have been lost since March 2012, including more than 1,700 effective full-time nursing positions in Queensland, which is yet another disgrace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state Treasurer has been unable to tell the Queensland parliament just how many GOC jobs have been lost on top of those core public sector jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government we discovered a quicksand of budget expenditure, hidden in policy bombs. These were left from those opposite, who spend Mr and Mrs Taxpayer's money unwisely and then borrow more. This week we wear the white ribbon representing respect. Judging by internet comments, many keyboard warriors have a long journey before they can respect themselves. Until this week, I have never been accused of being a lamb, nor a lion. I proudly say in this House though: I will always roar for my community. Labor's contempt for fiscal responsibility means every government department has to reduce their spending. The ABC is not exempt.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put these things in perspective: six years of Labor and $16 billion was ripped from Defence—not a squeak. But a reduction of $3.3 million—just 4.6 per cent—from the ABC—and the world is about to collapse. According to Nick Cater, Labor's Hawke government reduced the ABC budget by seven per cent. Do we see hypocrisy? Absolutely! CEO of the ABC, Mark Scott, has a lot to answer for, saying in a Senate estimates hearing last week that:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Last month I attended the Tuggeranong Bulldogs Junior AFL Club presentation day, where a number of awards were handed out to many deserving players. Family and friends also attended, and it was great to see them supporting their loved ones on this special day. The Tuggeranong Bulldogs AFL Club holds a special place in my heart: I was appointed patron of the club last year. As patron, I get to see the players in action, and I have had the chance to see them over two seasons—always in the freezing cold and always with the wind blowing straight off the snow on the Brindabellas. And whether the matches were won or lost, they were all played with passion. It is fantastic to see young kids getting outside, getting exercise and playing a game they love. The sportsmanship these players learn will be carried through into their later life, and I am sure it will set them up with great team-building skills and values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the coaches, managers, committee members and volunteers who make this club a success. Their dedication provides so much reward, not just for the players but for the whole Canberra community. In particular, I would like to thank the club's secretary, Kellie Hogan—she is here in the chamber today, along with two young Bulldogs players. I would also like to congratulate and thank club president, Richard Asher. I would also like to congratulate all the players on a great season: thank you for your enthusiasm, your cooperation and your dedication. Enjoy a nice break over summer and get ready for an even better season in 2015: go Doggies!</span>

Commencing his working life as a carpenter's apprentice, Terry joined the Army at the age of 18, transferred to the RAAF, and spent 3½ years serving in England, India and Burma. Following his discharge, Terry completed his apprenticeship and also studied architecture and engineering. Terry married his delightful wife, Joan, in 1949 and this was the beginning of a significant partnership in love, business and philanthropy. Terry's work ethic and quality is renowned in the region. Terry quickly realised the opportunities that were presenting themselves, and offered himself a chance to build a business for his family. Thus began the great journey of TG Matthews Pty Ltd. After four years, Terry and Joan had 120 employees and, up until just four years ago, Terry was the managing director, before selling to Vos Constructions. Terry's professional legacy will live on in the hundreds of built assets and iconic projects in Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terry Matthews was more than a successful builder; he was a generous, caring man interested in the lives of many and prepared to quietly give of his own well to fill the often-empty well of others. Because of this, his personal legacy will most definitely live on. On behalf of the electorate, I pass on my condolences to his wife of 65 years, Joan, and to his surviving brother, Godfrey; his children, Elizabeth, Greg, Jani, Suzie and Deb; his 12 grandchildren; and his five great-grandchildren. He was a humble man, committed to his country and to his community. He will be missed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  There is a reason why Liberal Victorian members and National Victorian members in this House continue to stand up pleading for Victorians to continue to support them in the state election, and to return the Napthine government. There is a reason—it is because so many people in Victoria are calling them out, and are ready to vote them out. In yesterday's <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>, the headline reads, 'Denis Napthine under fire from small business owners'. Small-business owners are now coming out against this government:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Premier Denis Napthine is facing a $1 million anti-government advertising campaign from small business groups and real estate agents that could undermine the state government's run-up to the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Council of Small Business of Australia (COSBOA) and the Real Estate Institute of Victoria (REIV) have placed anti-Liberal advertisements in newspapers in every marginal seat in the state, calling on small business owners to "vote them out".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On Tuesday, real estate agents will erect the first of several thousand signs that accuse the Napthine Government of costing Victoria 60,000 jobs since it was elected.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what is happening in the state of Victoria. Even their own are saying they cannot believe what is going on: a senior Liberal figure has said, 'Ever heard of a Liberal government that had James Packer, Lloyd Williams, shopkeepers and real estate agents actively campaigning against it?' But it is out there. It does not matter what you say in this House. It does not matter what the Victorian Liberals and Nationals say. They are on the countdown to the end of this terrible, shocking government in Victoria.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was most pleased recently to sponsor prizes at the Sports Shear Tasmania awards this year, because I know that wool is still one of our state's most important agricultural industries, and because shearers and woolhandlers are the backbone of the wool industry. The Shearer Judge of the Year award—which I was proud to sponsor—went to Jono Wilson, while the Woolhandler Judge of the Year went to Kylie Rigby from Fingal. Sports Shear Helper of the Year—sponsored by my colleague Mark Shelton, the member for Lyons in the Tasmanian state parliament—went to Greg Hazelwood of Oatlands. Other country Tasmanians who took out the top awards included Robert Glover from Bothwell, who won the State Champion Shearer ribbon as well as the Open Shearer of the Year ribbon, while Michelle Walker from Carrick won the State Woolhandling Champion ribbon and the Woolhandler of the Year award. Jake Goss from Campbelltown was named Champion Senior Shearer; George Higgins from Oatlands was Intermediate Shearer Of The Year—although, having seen George Higgins shear, I am not sure why he is in the Intermediate class; Sam Byers was awarded the Learner Shearer of the Year ribbon; and Frenece Banovich was named Novice Woolhandler of the Year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">135700 The Sports Shear awards are a wonderful annual recognition of Tasmania's gun shearers and those working hard to fill their shearing slippers. Australia may no longer ride on the sheep's back but, by Jove, the noble fibre that is wool generates so much wealth from farm to retail store. I am proud to have been involved in the industry for many years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  One thing that we in this place can all agree on is that because of demand in Asia Australian agriculture has a very bright future. Free trade agreements with Japan, South Korea and China are welcome and important, but market access issues will remain in place for some time and international competition will be intense. What gives Australia a competitive advantage more than anything else is our clean, green, safe image in global markets. My concern, though, is that the Abbott government has dropped the ball on biosecurity. It has done so by cutting departmental funding in the area of quarantine. It has done so by cutting important CSIRO research funding which goes to research into quarantine. It has done so by delaying quarantine reforms introduced by the former Labor government—14 months on from the election and there is still no bill back in the parliament. It has done so by threatening to take biosecurity out of the Department of Agriculture and putting it into some new super department, which would be a disaster for our clean, green, safe image.</span>

On the ABC last night Minister Joyce excused himself for failing to act on SPC by saying he was busy working on a drought package, a package for which Victorian farmers are not eligible. I am sure the member for Gippsland, who is at the table, has an interest in that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I rise to share with the House a fantastic initiative to be implemented by a Dobell primary school. Better Buddies is an antibullying program at Brooke Avenue Public School and is based on the Alannah and Madeline Foundation's belief that 'all children should have a safe and happy childhood  without being subjected to any form of violence.' Better Buddies introduces and reinforces pro-social behaviours amongst kindergarten students. Fortunately, during the initial stages of the program the school received a generous donation from one of their families which enabled the purchase of a Buddy Bear for every kindergarten student. Thanks to this gift all of the school's kindergarten students can participate in and benefit from Better Buddies. Each student spends time with their bear throughout the day, reading to them, demonstrating their writing skills, holding discussions with them and ensuring the overall wellbeing of each Buddy Bear. The program engages students through various activities aimed at teaching students how to interact with each other in a fair and fun way. I am informed by their classroom teacher, Lisa McBride, that, so far, the students have engaged in discussions about what it means to be a buddy, what their feelings are telling them, how to deal with difficult situations and how the students can care for each other. The school is hoping to extend the program in 2015 to include stage 2 students, with a view to building positive relationships throughout the entire school. I would like to congratulate principal Kerry Whellam and her wonderful team at Brooke Avenue for this initiative that is effectively supporting Brooke Avenue's youngest students.</span>

These notes are from a blog written last night by one of the members of staff. I draw the attention of the House to the personal stories, to people like Di McCracken, who shares the front desk with Katja Baidoo, and works two days a week. This was Di's first foray back into the workforce after taking time off to have her children. She has always gone above and beyond in everything she needed to do and is always there with a smile. Unfortunately for Di, her role since getting a stable job and some security in life has absolutely melted away.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  Christmas decorations are going up in our local streets and shopping centres as Australians across the country start to ready themselves for Christmas. Adding spark to this joyous spirit, my annual Higgins Christmas card competition, based on the theme 'What Christmas Means to Me', again brought an avalanche of wonderfully creative entries from local school children in my electorate. Sun, sand and barbecues were merged with the traditional themes of reindeer and Christmas trees. For the first time, I received an entry in Chinese, reflecting the diversity of residents within my electorate. One common theme was family, giving pause to reflect on how lucky a country we are but also to remember those less fortunate than ourselves.</span>

I congratulate my second-runner-up, grade 5 student Steffi Delimitrou; first-runner-up, grade 3 student Mitchell Hoskin; and winner of the competition, grade 5 student Alannah Tuohy. I also congratulate and acknowledge their wonderfully dedicated art teachers, Ms Susan McDonald from Sacre Coeur and Ms Connie Barkatsas from Stonnington Primary School, and I acknowledge and thank all of the other schools who entered the competition and whose children's works are now proudly on display in my electorate office windows in Malvern.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I rise to share the story of the Fremantle Foundation and its philanthropic program, the Impact 100 awards. Impact 100 pools the annual donations of $1,000 made by 100 local people to make a difference, by providing a 'game changing' $100,000 grant to a deserving project or charity in the Fremantle area. The recently announced 2014 winner was FORM's 100 Hampton Road project. FORM, an independent, non-profit cultural organisation established in 1968 that develops and advocates for excellence in creativity and artistic practice in Western Australia, will use the Impact 100 grant to install a commercial-grade kitchen and expand its cooking program at Foundation Housing's 192-bed lodging house. By embedding skills, training, and employment opportunities within this community-building project, FORM aims to provide some of Fremantle's most vulnerable residents with pathways out of homelessness. Driven by the irrepressible energy and vision of its lone paid employee, CEO Dylan Smith, the volunteer-directed Fremantle Foundation this year sought to address the pressing issues of mental wellbeing and homelessness. Last year's inaugural Impact 100 winner was Dismantle, a not-for-profit social enterprise dedicated to improving the lives of disengaged and at-risk young people in WA.</span>

Denis Napthine supports it. The Labor Party oppose it. There could not be a clearer choice facing the people of Victoria this Saturday.

He has affirmed that the Australian Submarine Corporation is an important part of our defence materiel institutional structure. It services our submarine fleet. It is helping to build our air warfare destroyers. Obviously we want it to be in the best possible shape, and that is exactly what is happening—thanks to this government and this minister.</span>

We are focused on tomorrow. Tomorrow is about building East West Link, creating 7,000 jobs.

                  </a>  The $3 billion that the Commonwealth government has committed will then come back to Canberra, and Victorians not only will lose out on the $3 billion from Canberra for new roads but will end up paying more than $1 billion in compensation to a building and construction company for a road that was never built. Even worse, if Labor is elected on Saturday in Victoria, 250 construction workers who are working on East West Link today will immediately lose their jobs. Why? Because Labor is tearing up the contract—a contract to build a more productive economy, a contract that is going to get rid of nearly two hours of travel time across Melbourne, a contract that is helping to deliver prosperity and opportunity to the people of Victoria. This is a classic and simple example. We are the people that help to create jobs in the economy. It is the coalition that helps to deliver jobs. It is the Labor Party that always costs jobs, it is the Labor Party that costs productivity and it is the Labor Party that hurts the economy.</span>

We are trying to bring back the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We are trying to establish the Registered Organisations Commission and who is opposing those reforms?

Only yesterday, Nigel Hadgkiss, the Fair Work Building and Construction Director, said he had identified more than 500 projects, in receipt of $50 billion in federal funding, which are at risk of running over budget and time unless legal abuses in the industry end. It pains me to say that unlawful conduct in Australia's construction industry is still a deplorable state of affairs. </span>

In spite of all the warnings from former royal commissioners and from the Fair Work Building and Construction Commission, he wants to rip up Victoria's building code and put John Setka back in charge of running Victoria—the head of the CFMEU. He went so far as to stand next to representatives of the CFMEU in 2012 when he announced that he would rip up Victoria's building code.</span>

On 30 October, the Prime Minister joined with Premier Napthine in announcing a joint police task force into illegal activity within Victoria's unions. The joint AFP-Victoria Police task force will consist of investigative officers, surveillance units and intelligence units. It will investigate some of the very concerning allegations that have been raised about the CFMEU. If we look at the evidence provided by counsel assisting the royal commission into union corruption, allegations against the CFMEU include: blackmail and extortion perpetrated by officers of the CFMEU in Victoria and Queensland; the making of a death threat by one CFMEU organiser to another, and the failure of anyone within that union to commence a proper investigation into that incident; defiance of court orders; and intimidation of individuals and businesses. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the CFMEU likes to rub shoulders with criminals—members of the Comancheros bikie gang and underworld heavy George Alex. The Victorian state secretary of the CFMEU, John Setka, has been convicted or fined in relation to 40 separate charges. Offences include wilful trespass, assault and assault on police. Setka has been described by underworld figure Mick Gatto as a close mate. Setka has another mate in Victorian opposition leader Daniel Andrews—because, despite all of the evidence, the Victorian Labor Party is determined to maintain a close relationship with this union by continuing to receive substantial political donations and even allowing John Setka, a close mate of Mick Gatto's, to address a conference of the Victorian Labor Party. </span>

                  </a>  At that cabinet table will be another CFMEU member who is the current shadow minister for planning, major projects and infrastructure, Brian Tee. The Victorian economy, particularly in the areas of construction and major projects, is not going to be particularly well served by a minister who is subservient to a union that is rife with corruption and criminality. There is a very old saying, one that will be very well known to members in this place, 'Always dance with the one who brung ya.' In the case of Victorian opposition leader Daniel Andrews, if he were to win the election on Saturday—installed by the CFMEU and financed by the CFMEU—the one who 'brung' him will be the most notoriously corrupt union in the country.</span>

The hardworking member for Higgins did something that her neighbour, the member for Melbourne Ports, did not do. She voted to repeal the carbon tax. He voted to keep the carbon tax. She asked what was the impact of that carbon tax, on the latest figures, for Victorians. We now know from the latest figures of the Clean Energy Regulator that over a two-year period Victorians paid over $3 billion in carbon tax. The largest part of that carbon tax over those two years was $2.7 billion in electricity payments. As a consequence of the repeal, for which the member for Higgins voted, the member for La Trobe voted, the member for Corangamite voted and all of the members on this side voted, those prices have been reduced. We see a 12.4 per cent reduction for Powerdirect customers; for small business customers with Lumo Energy, a 10.7 per cent reduction compared with what it would otherwise have been; and for Simply Energy, a 10 per cent reduction. That is what we see in Victoria. But if the Labor Party were back in power and if the state Labor Party had their way as well, we would see that Lumo Energy customers would have a 10.7 per cent increase in their electricity bills. They are the real things that are occurring. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We might ask ourselves: what other firms paid the price in Victoria? For Murray Goulburn Co-operative, it was $2.6 million for dairy production, for milk; Fonterra, $2.4 million for dairy production—a tax on milk. This is the tax that these people want to bring back. So, if the Leader of the Opposition were to be elected as Prime Minister, he would be bringing back a tax on Murray Goulburn, Fonterra and Tatura Milk. By the way, throw in La Trobe University; they paid almost half a million dollars in additional costs in the last year alone. That brings me to the impact of the carbon tax on Victoria's hospitals and on its public transport. The latest figures we have is that over a two-year period there was $26.7 million from the carbon tax, which they love, on our public hospitals and on our public transport in Victoria. They bleat about the impact of costs. But they want to increase costs on public transport, they want to increase costs on public hospitals and they want to increase costs on milk. At the end of the day, we voted to repeal the carbon tax; they want to bring it back. We are for lower costs. </span>

Let's get rid of Barnacle Bill! What this government is doing is calmly and methodically addressing the problems that our nation faces. We are successfully addressing the problems that our nation faces. Economic security and national security are both being addressed by this government. The boats have stopped. The budget is coming back under control—no thanks to Barnacle Bill sitting opposite. They created the problem—this is the truth. The truth is that Labor gave us a debt and deficit disaster, a fiscal deterioration unprecedented in our history. They gave us a massive fiscal problem and, having created the problem, they are now trying to sabotage the solution. That is the truth. They are trying to sabotage the solution. They are the greatest fiscal vandals in Australia's history. That is a what they are. They are fiscal saboteurs. They are a menace to our country's future. That is exactly what Labor has demonstrated itself to be over the last 14 months. They were incompetent in government, and they are wreckers in opposition. The barnacle that most needs to be gotten rid of is Barnacle Bill sitting opposite. </span>

I welcome the opportunity to update the House on a signature policy of the Abbott government that we took to the last election, and after 12 months we have already seen the benefits of the New Colombo Plan. This is an investment in our country's future by investing in our young people, in our potential leaders of the future, and by investing in our engagement in region. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the pilot phase of this program in 2014, 1,300 young Australian undergraduates from universities across the country had the opportunity to study, live and work in locations in our region—in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia. Just this week, the Minister for Education and I announced that in 2015, 3,150 young Australians will be given the opportunity to study in universities across our region. In fact, 37 Australian universities have produced recipients of New Colombo Plan grants and scholarships to study in 32 countries in our region. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From India in the west and Mongolia in the north to the Cook Islands in the east and 29 countries in between, young Australians between the ages of 18 and 28 will have a transformational experience. The member for Tangney will be interested that Murdoch University in his own electorate has produced 42 recipients of Student Mobility Grants for short courses or semester-long courses, and they will be undertaking work and study in India, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. A number of Victorian members will be interested to know that over 700 young Victorians are being given a chance in 2015 by the Abbott government to study in universities in our region—in particular 90 students from Deakin University will be studying in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Vanuatu. We have 91 students from La Trobe studying in China, India, Malaysia, Samoa, Singapore and Taiwan. From Monash there are 98 students; from RMIT 57 students; Swinburne 66 students; and from the University of Melbourne 138 students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members might be interested to know that the top destination for our applicants for Student Mobility Grants and semester-long courses was Indonesia with 600 students. China was second with 550 students, and India third with 300 students. Next week I hope to announce the winners of the scholarships—70 scholarships for up to 12 months. This is all about ensuring our young people have new perspectives, new skills and new insights that add to the productivity and prosperity of this country and our engagement with the region. This government delivers!</span>

He said: 'We are bringing the budget into surplus. It is a remarkable accomplishment.' It was an accomplishment that they never actually achieved! That is the problem, and they have suddenly gone remarkably quiet, because they know that you need a budget surplus for a strong economy. Not only did they not deliver it in their six years of government, and not only did they give us six record budget deficits in a row, but now that a government has been elected that is determined to fix this problem that they created, they are sabotaging it.</span>

He served as president of the Victorian Farmers Federation between 2009 and 2012—the youngest ever, I understand.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worthwhile looking at the electorate of Mallee as an example of the impact of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It is a major regional centre in Australia. The Mallee itself represents one of the great horticultural regions in Australia; it grows 62 per cent of Australia's almonds, for which tariffs of up to 24 per cent will go. The Mallee grows 75 per cent of Australia's table grapes, which largely go to Guangzhou, and tariffs of 13 per cent will go. The Mallee grows 90 per cent of Australia's dried fruit, and tariffs of 10 per cent will go. The Mallee is a huge source of avocados, which attract tariffs of 25 per cent and these will go. The Mallee is a strong citrus region and tariffs of up to 30 per cent will go. Tariffs on orange and carrot juice will go. The Mallee is a major wine-producing region and will benefit greatly from the removal of tariffs of up to 30 per cent on Australian wine. It is a huge region for barley—a $548 million export industry to China today— and the three per cent tax will go. While the Mallee is not dairying and beef and sheepmeat country, total tariff elimination on dairy and beef and sheepmeat will result in a huge increase in domestic consumption of grains—which is one of the great strengths of the Mallee—for dairy cows, cattle, sheep and the like. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On services, Ramsay Health Care, a great Australian company, operates the Mildura public hospital. Ramsay Health is currently negotiating to be appointed the operator of five hospitals in Chengdu city, serving a mix of public and private patients. In future, Ramsay can build whatever hospitals they like in China, own them and operate them 100 per cent. The Mallee TAFE, known as SuniTAFE, is recruiting students from China as a result of the free trade agreement. Of course, the tourism sector is benefiting enormously because of the investment opportunity in hotels, resorts and attractions. Under the new working holiday visa, 5,000 young Chinese will be available for seasonal work in areas where it is difficult to get Australian workers. This FTA is not only transformational for Australia; it is transformational especially for the Mallee.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I thank the member for Hume. Not only is he a great member for his local electorate; he is a person from a family in the cattle and sheep game, so he knows a lot about this industry. He is a person who comes from an area where just recently he was at the opening of Hilltop abattoir, which will have about 380 employees. That is great; those are new jobs. That is what we do on this side of the chamber, that is what we do in government—get people into work. I also note that the GM Scott abattoir is also expanding; that is more jobs. The member for Hume is a very talented man—a university medallist, a Rhodes scholar. It is good to have a few of those on our side. It is always good to have some talent, and that is how you get a good government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good also to be able to go through some of the details of why this advantage, this expansion in beef, is going to get even better—a market for fresh, chilled and frozen. We sold $787 million worth of beef there last year. It currently has a 12 to 25 per cent tariff on it. But after the excellent work of the Minister for Trade and Investment, that tariff, in nine years, is going down to zero. In sheep meat, for which we had $446 million worth of sales last year under a coalition government, that tariff—it has currently got a 12 to 23 per cent tariff—after eight years is going down to zero. For goat meat the tariff is currently at 20 per cent, and it is going down after eight years to zero. For bovine offal, it is going from 12 per cent down to zero. Sheep and goat meat offal is also going down to zero. We are actually reducing these tariffs. This is going to bring an explosion in further exports into one of our major markets. An explosion such that Meat and Livestock Australia has said that out to 2030 this is going to be worth $3.3 billion in the beef industry alone. It is going to be worth $1.8 billion in the sheep meat industry. The National Farmers' Federation said this agreement is an 'outstanding achievement that will build on Australia's important trading future'. But what does the shadow minister for agriculture say? This is what the shadow minister for agriculture, the alternative government, said: 'There can be no doubt that the benefits are overstated.'</span>

The free-trade agreement offers enormous opportunities for the aged care sector in Australia, and that is because the free-trade agreement will allow wholly Australian owned and operated hospitals and aged care institutions to be established in China. Consider the size, the enormity of the potential market in China. Currently, there are about 194 million people aged 60 and over in China, and that number will actually grow significantly as the Chinese population ages. The Chinese plan over the next six years to double the number of aged care beds in the country to 3.8 million. They predict that the workforce in aged care in China will grow from a current workforce of about one million people to about 10 million people by 2020. So this is an enormous opportunity for Australia, as the member for Lindsay asks about, in terms of the aged care sector. Imagine the possibilities for the aged care sector in China: the home care services programs and the enormous expansion that will occur there; the construction and the operation of living units and apartments for retired and older people; the design and planning of aged care; the infrastructure investment that will go on as part of this; and of course the training and education opportunities for the enormous growth in the aged care sector in China. That is no doubt why those in the aged care sector, the leadership of the aged care sector in Australia, have welcomed this agreement. Professor John Kelly, the CEO of Aged &amp; Community Services Australia, said that the new China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will motivate more organisations involved with the delivery of services to Australia's ageing population to consider the opportunities that come with international trade. Professor Kelly went on:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say that this would see a surge in that activity. This is going to mean investment for Australian companies and returns to Australia; it is going to mean that more workers will have jobs as a result of this agreement. This is another example of a can-do government getting on with the job of building a better Australia.</span>

                  </a>  Madam Speaker, you only have to mention a bill and the barrister gets to his feet! I respect that. In deference to our former profession, we know that lawyers have families and you have to respect that. They struggle—and it is not so easy now, of course, for the honourable member. Let me be very clear about this: the ABC has been exempt from efficiency dividends since the mid-nineties—nearly 20 years. Were the efficiency dividend that is currently applying to other government agencies been applied to the ABC, it would be 2½ per cent this year, 2½ per cent next year, 2½ per cent the following year and one per cent in the fourth year. In the ABC that would amount to about $250 million. But that is not what was applied to the ABC. In terms of the Department of Finance, they are getting over five years roughly the same amount of money so it is perfectly reasonable to say it is in substance, in terms of a return to the budget, effectively the same financial consequence as an efficiency dividend. </span>

                  </a>  It is exactly what I said on Sky. I explained it. The savings to the ABC are, as the Prime Minister said, much better calibrated, much better targeted, than an efficiency dividend—unlike your side, we have done the hard work to make the ABC more efficient.</span>

I can sense the excitement is there, because the trade agreement with China has opened up a world of delicious opportunities for businesses right across our country and particularly in the great state of Victoria. Hasn’t the Minister for Trade and Investment done a fantastic job? He has delivered the trade trifecta, and that warms the hearts of all of us in this place—particularly the heart of my fellow man from Albury, the former Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister. What a great achievement. It has been recognised by ACCI—ACCI have congratulated Minister Robb and they have congratulated the Australian government on delivering this trade agreement between these two countries. The Australian Industry Group rightly has recognised that this agreement provides Australian businesses with more export and more investment opportunities by opening up access to the large Chinese market while also seeking to ensure that appropriate safeguards have been included for local industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so important to open these doors. Anyone who has ever been in business knows a simple fact—there is no substitute for customers. These agreements open the doors to hundreds of millions of potential customers, and that will grow jobs and economic opportunities in our country. It is not enough just to open the doors; we need to make sure that our businesses can take advantage of these outstanding trade agreements—not just businesses in Victoria, though they will benefit substantially, but businesses right across Australia. The groundwork has been laid. The Prime Minister led an outstanding trade delegation, with the minister for investment—I was happy to be a part of that—to China with hundreds of Australian businesses. We learned of the appetite and the desire for Australian goods and services from big Australian companies and from small Australian businesses. The appetite is there, but we needed to make sure that we had the capacity to deliver that potential. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what has been done with these agreements.  But people are not left to their own devices. Support is available to make these opportunities our own. The government's decision to expand the Export Market Development Grants program gives another $50 million to support businesses to take advantage of these opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the member's electorate, the Pyrenees Hay Processors Cooperative has benefited from the EMDG program. The AME Systems business is another example. We have also seen Efic focus its work on supporting small businesses. We have seen the private effort of businesses led by David Goodwin, for example, the Australian Made stores, opening hundreds of Australian retail presences in China to deliver that potential. This government has put in place the economic action strategy to build growth, to deliver reward, to make sure opportunity is within reach—not just opening the door but also providing the tools to make those opportunities real. More jobs, more trade—that is a stronger economy, that is what this government is on about.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Thank you very much to the member for Herbert for his question. He is a very proud North Queenslander and he does us very proud in this place. The government is obviously concerned, as all Australians are, about what is happening in West Africa with people losing their lives to Ebola. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have provided significant support—$42 million in total—to help people in West Africa. To make sure that we can provide support on the ground we have contracted with the great Australian company Aspen to provide up to $20 million of funding so that in concert with the United Kingdom we can provide a 100-bed facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course this does not happen by chance. There is a lot of work that must go into these sorts of contracts. We must consider the way that we can deal with Australian health workers if they contract the virus in West Africa. We have to make sure that we have assurances around evacuation. Given that there is a 50 per cent fatality rate for health workers in West Africa, we need to make sure that we can provide those health workers with the health support that they need, if they contract the virus from those whom they are treating. This is absolutely essential, and it would be reckless of any government that sent health workers into harm's way without having properly contemplated how it is that you could put this contract and these operations into place. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a number of meetings of the National Security Committee. We took advice from the Chief of Defence. I met on countless occasions with the Chief Medical Officer. We had advice from the head of border protection and security. We spoke with all of those people in the United Kingdom and the United States, our partners abroad, and we came, as a government, to a reasonable position of which we should all be very proud.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a contrast in approach here. This contrast in approach is best evidenced by the member for Sydney.

Just before the Prime Minister responded to what he said was an interjection from the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition appears to make some remarks, but those remarks are not audible on the tape.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FEENEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  This is a very important matter of public importance, because the failure of the Prime Minister to sack the Minister for Defence means that this government now crawls forward with yet another bleeding wound. It is plainly obvious that the Prime Minister must act. Dennis Shanahan posted in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> only a short time ago: 'David Johnston's job as defence minister "finished"'. And we saw earlier from Paul Kelly, in today's edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>that this government now confronts 'a growing crisis of trust'. This is a government going forward with a wounded Minister for Defence, and it cannot stand. The real tragedy and atrocity here is that the Australian Defence Force—its men and women—are currently on operations in the Middle East while being led by a bumbling minister. And this is not a minister who has been bumbling for a day, or for hours, but he has been bumbling for 15 months. This is known to those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 12 months, the Minister for Defence has given 40 speeches and interviews, while the foreign affairs minister has given 200. This is a minister who has been in the witness protection program of the Prime Minister for quite some time. When Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced 600 ADF personnel were to be deployed to the Middle East, he had standing by his side the Chief of the Defence Force. But where was the defence minister? He remained in hiding. And so, as this country sent its people into war, we saw Hugh White, Professor of Strategic Studies at the ANU, make the remark: 'He was incapable of answering the most basic of questions about why we are undertaking this military operation.' For 15 months, we have seen this minister deal with nothing but inaction and failure. You might recall, some short time ago, it took the minister two weeks to respond to claims made about the alleged mistreatment of asylum seekers by Royal Australian Navy sailors. And when he finally emerged, he said, 'I have not said much because, I have to confess, I was extremely angry and I have required some period of time to cool off.' Well, here is a man who lacks the temperament to be the Minister for Defence. Such a man has his finger on the trigger? Be reassured that he does not have his finger on the trigger. The Prime Minister and his colleagues have made sure that in fact this Minister for Defence has very little responsibility at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Australian Strategic Policy Institute submarine conference David Johnston began his contribution by saying, 'I have been told to say this and I have been told not to deviate from my speech.' He is on a very tight leash indeed. Most spectacularly of all, when asked to explain his absence at a meeting of the National Security Committee—a meeting of the NSC held while Australians are at war—he said, 'I didn't have much to add.' At the very beginning of his time as Minister for Defence he found himself overruled by the Prime Minister on the composition of his white paper planning team. It is the most fundamental of responsibilities in his portfolio and one with which he was not trusted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The atrocities continue. We saw retired Major General Molan appear after a mere three weeks of service with the minister, which was all he could take of working with a minister who was in fact responsible for nothing. Major General Molan is a loyal, Liberal advocate—he is seeking Liberal party preselection in New South Wales. Notwithstanding those allegiances, when it came to criticising the minister he said, 'That's a conclusion you can come to. I'll have something to say with others in private.' Clearly he did, because this Minister for Defence remains absolutely in the witness protection program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Broken promises have been a spectacular feature of Senator Johnston's time. He stood at the Australian Submarine Corporation in South Australia on 8 May 2013 and said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a promise that has not survived first contact, but it is plain to all of us that it is a promise they should keep or that at the very least they should bring themselves to ensure that there is an open tender for this multibillion dollar, multidecade policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Johnston came into office as defence minister after intimating to the shipbuilding industry that he would bridge the valley of death by commissioning a fourth air warfare destroyer, another undertaking that did not survive first contact. Then, when talking about rescuing the shipbuilding industry in this country, he commissioned the Winter review. On the basis of that review he has denigrated the industry again and again and again. But what is the most striking feature of the Winter review, Deputy Speaker? No-one knows—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  There is no Deputy Speaker in the chair.</span>

                  </a>  Quite right. No-one knows, because this report remains secret. Despite the minister's undertakings to deliver this report to the Australian people, it remains a secret.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There we have it, a defence minister who has been in the witness protection program for quite some time, who is not trusted with serious responsibility, who is not allowed to make serious decisions and with whom senior retired personnel from the ADF cannot work. This is a sinking feeling that those opposite are now well acquainted with, a sinking feeling that has been made manifest in the last 24 hours. After his extraordinary remark that he would not trust the ASC to build a canoe—an extraordinary indulgence—we saw the Liberal Party scatter as they sought to distance themselves from this broken reed of a minister. One senior Liberal said, 'Senator Johnston's comments were breathtaking.' We have seen revealed the fact that these comments came just one fortnight after he apologised to the ASC chairman, Bruce Carter, for being critical of the agency's work. That was an apology that did not survive two weeks. We heard another senior Liberal say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This whole process has been undermined by Johnston and his office from the very beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another senior Liberal said in the press today that these 'were some of the most stupid words I have ever heard from a senior minister.' Last night, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Jamie Briggs, said Senator Johnston's comments were just 'wrong'. In the aftermath of Senator Johnston's extraordinary performance, we saw the Prime Minister himself rush to contradict him, saying, 'I have full confidence in the ASC and its sustainment work for the Royal Australian Navy.' Very rarely do we see a Prime Minister rush to contradict a minister so quickly. Senator Birmingham, a South Australian Liberal Party senator, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We should be honest about the problems submarines and shipbuilding have faced at Osborne, but that is no excuse for denigration of the workforce or of the extensive capabilities that South Australia has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most spectacularly, we have heard today Steven Marshall, the leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia, say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unless he can rebuild some connection, some rapport, some confidence within the industry, then I don't think he has any alternative (but to resign) …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I don't think that his current position is tenable unless he can rebuild that confidence with the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This minister's collapse is manifest to all, and with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper making it plain to us today, it seems that soon we will not be able to read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> as well as not be able to watch the ABC. We have a defence minister who has gone from lame duck to dead duck. We have a minister who today is plainly on life support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last year, ASC has transformed its submarine maintenance program. Again and again it has exceeded the Navy's target for submarine readiness. We have seen improvements in the availability of the Collins class fleet to defend our national interests. This has been done on the back of a reform process that the former Labor government was very proud to have initiated and that even those opposite were forced to concede had done the job and done it well. Notwithstanding that, we have a minister who apparently feels that he can denigrate the industry and the ASC without any regard for the fact that the ASC today, right now, is responsible for sustaining and maintaining our submarine capability. There are literally hundreds of submariners under the oceans of this world who rely on the work of the ASC, and they are told by this debacle of a minister that that organisation could not be trusted to build a canoe. This is an atrocity that cannot stand. To add insult to injury he now says it was a rhetorical flourish. This is a man who does not have the temperament to be the Minister for Defence. This plainly is a man who does not have the judgement to be the Minister for Defence. This is a man who has a record of 15 months of inaction and dithering. The words 'blundering' and 'withering' appear again and again in reference to this minister. Over the course of 12 months we have seen this minister do next to nothing. There has been failure after failure to proceed with the important LAND400 project. Those opposite spout about how important is SEA1000, the Future Submarine project, but 15 months down the track we have nothing. We have a shipbuilding industry that is in crisis because after 15 months this government has yet to achieve anything except send our shipbuilding work overseas, feeding the shipyards of foreign nations without any regard to our own and breaking its own promises and intimations to the industry that there would be work and reform in the industry. Again and again we see this minister relying on the fact that, he says, this industry is not up to the job and relying on a report that remains a secret. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is interesting to reflect that 1,600 questions have been asked during question time and, out of those, only one has been asked to me, by the member for Batman, on defence—just one. So let's be very up-front: those opposite are not interested in substantive matters of defence and national security. They are interested in politics, plain and simple.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has jumped on this like a rabid dog to a bone, despite the Leader of the Opposition being at the cabinet table when $16 billion was ripped out of defence. I wonder what the Leader of the Opposition said around that cabinet table. Perhaps he was too busy worrying about who he was going to backstab. So let's see this confected outrage for what it is. It comes from an opposition leader who is directionless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Defence, to his credit, has come out this morning and apologised for the comments that he made in the heat of the moment. I think it is reasonable to say that a rhetorical flourish is hardly reason for dismissal of a minister let alone a matter of public importance in the House. But if Labor wants to have a debate and if the member for Hunter, who has just turned up, wants to have a debate, let's have it. Let's not forget that those opposite had 16 ministerial reshuffles in the defence portfolio in six years. That is one every five months. The member for Hunter was removed for breaking the ministerial code of conduct. That is a fact. So if those opposite want to talk about the strengths of defence portfolio ministers they should be wary of the winding road and the red or blue tablet that you take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is reasonable to say that the Labor Party are directionless when it comes to the issue of defence. Arguments that seek to whitewash their shame, their inadequacy and their history of doing nothing will not wash in here. So let's put the facts on the table when it comes to defence in South Australia, because the facts and the truth, Member for Batman, will truly set you free.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the government will spend $34 million in South Australia on the Future Submarine program, building our competencies and knowledge base in cooperation with industry. Over the next four years, in anticipation of the defence white paper, $4.2 billion will be spent in South Australia. This year alone, almost $1 billion worth of defence procurement and sustainment work is being undertaken in South Australia. In fact, 25 per cent of all sustainment across the nation is South Australian. That state is seriously punching above its weight on numbers, to its credit. There are 44 separate acquisition projects, including: the air warfare destroyer program; support for and upgrade of the P3 Orions; and upgrades to the Anzac class frigates and the army's communications systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia is also home to some 58 separate sustainment programs, including the sustainment of Collins and the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. In February this year, the PM announced that Australia will acquire eight P8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft that will be based at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. The government will consider four additional P8As as part of the defence white paper process. There are enormous opportunities for industry and jobs in South Australia. Businesses in that state stand to benefit by as much as $1 billion through the construction of facilities at Edinburgh and elsewhere to meet the requirements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year, the Prime Minister announced the government had committed to the acquisition of the highly capable Triton UAV. This will also be based in Adelaide, South Australia, bringing significant further economic benefits. The acquisition will require approximately $140 million worth of new facilities, $100 million of which will be invested in South Australia. Support requirements for Triton will create a further $20 million worth in opportunities annually for businesses in South Australia. In March, the Prime Minister announced a contract that includes $78 million in work for BAE in South Australia, part of a five-year multimillion dollar contract with Boeing for the sustainment of the Wedgetail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, there is an enormous amount of work that goes to South Australia. There is a plan for shipbuilding, and there is a plan for shipbuilding in South Australia. There are management issues. There is no question about that when it comes to our fleet of ships. There is a reform strategy for the air warfare destroyer project, a gift from those opposite two years late and up to $600 million over budget. There is nothing like fiscal gifts from the Labor Party!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, the government committed a further $78.2 million to accelerate work on the future frigate that will keep alive the option of building future frigates in Australia—another gift, legacy and disgrace left by the Labor Party. Be in no doubt—the nation should be in no doubt at all—that there is a huge budget being spent on defence work in South Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The substance of this motion is fraudulent. We know it, the House knows it and the member for Batman knows it. Let's not forget the without-precedent and baseless slur in Senator Conroy's attack on Lieutenant General Campbell. Senator Conroy is the shadow minister for defence. He accused a three-star general, one of the most senior military officers in the country, of running a political cover-up. What did the leader of the opposition do? Nothing. The shadow minister for defence accused an outstanding, credentialled three-star general of a cover-up, and the Leader of the Opposition turned his back. Did he demand an apology from Conroy? No. Did he censure Conroy? No. Did he demand Conroy make public statements? No, he turned his back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what did the member for Batman do about that? On 27 February this year, during an interview with Peter van Onselen on Sky, this issue was raised. The member for Batman said of the matter that it was sufficient for Senator Conroy to withdraw his remarks—it was sufficient. That was the member for Batman's view—that it was sufficient that Senator Conroy just withdraw his remarks after saying to a three star general: 'This is a cover-up'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet today, clearly, the Minister for Defence publicly apologising and making a statement in the Senate is not good enough. It is good enough for Senator Conroy but not good enough for anyone else. Do you know what that is called? It is called hypocrisy. It is called hypocrisy—writ large. It is called a whitewash too. It is called a brood of vipers. It is called hypocrisy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to talk about hypocrisy, if we want to unpack hypocrisy from the Labor Party, the list is long. I refer to a publication, <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ittle </span><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ok of Labor's D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">efence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ackflips</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>that goes through about 30 of them in nauseating detail. Let us look at them. Prime Minister Rudd sent an adviser to the national security cabinet. Prime Minister Gillard sent her bodyguard to the national security cabinet. Defence spending reached the lowest level of GDP since 1938. On 38 occasions, Labor ministers promised three per cent growth in the Defence budget, and what did we get? $16 billion worth of cuts. You did not even come close, did you? You missed it by this much!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You promised, before 2007, to index DFRDB pensions. How did that go? It went nowhere! In fact, this side of the House tried to pass private members' bills, as well as using other processes of the House. There were three attempts. And what did you do? You broke the promise. You promised to build 12 family health clinics. How many did you build? None. You promised to look after Defence personnel—and then you tried to take travel away from 21,000 of them. You decided in 2013 to have a white paper, and all you had was some dross you served up with a $150,000 backdrop of jets, fighters and other defence gear. Your 2012-13 budget delayed and cancelled capability—a 34 per cent reduction in Defence Capability Plan funding and over 40 per cent of DCP projects impacted by cuts. Despite all that, the Labor Party has the temerity, the audacity, the blatant effrontery to come in here and demand that we remove an effective defence minister. Hypocrisy, my friend. Hypocrisy is your name.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  I rise today as the member for the electorate in which the Australian Submarine Corporation is located. I rise to say squarely to the Prime Minister: this defence minister must go. The comments yesterday were the most reckless and insulting remarks you could imagine from a defence minister, but they were not isolated. They were just the latest in a series of slip-ups, broken promises, blunders and other acts of sheer incompetence by this fellow who has clearly—it is now absolutely clear—been promoted above his ability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You do not have to take it just from the member for Batman, from me or from other speakers on this side of the House, because colleague after colleague on the government benches are lining up to say this defence minister is a joke. Some of them are doing it on the record. Every South Australian MP, with the exception of the member for Sturt, has stood up in the media, put their name to it and said that his comments were hopeless. They have disassociated themselves from his comments—except for the member for Sturt, who refuses to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have just seen another audition, this time from the assistant minister. He is but one of a series of frontbenchers—most of whom do it by backgrounding, not putting their name to it—lining up like Tonya Harding to take this defence minister out at the knees, because they have picked up the smell of blood. The member for Bass is up there because he knows that if the assistant minister moves up then he moves up to be a parliamentary secretary. You can tell it—right up to the back. The furthest back of the backbenchers have picked up the smell of blood. They know this guy is hanging in the breeze—but not the Prime Minister, apparently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is dreadfully happy with this chap. He thinks he is doing an outstanding job. He has his full confidence. He is quite happy to see a minister stand up and disparage, in the other place, the skills of some of the most highly skilled tradesmen and tradeswomen in this country who are building and sustaining some of the most important naval assets this country has—our submarines and our air warfare destroyers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to some of those policy issues that the member for Batman has so skilfully outlined, consider the human impact. There are 3,000 workers at the Australian Submarine Corporation, mainly in South Australia but also in Western Australia. Thousands of those workers have had their capacity, their lifelong skills, impugned by this defence minister. They rightly regard themselves as having some of the best skills in this country, but they are also intensely proud to be part of the nation's defence apparatus, building and sustaining incredibly important naval assets. You have to ask yourself—even the member for Bass, I am sure, will ask himself—how does that make those families feel? How does that make the proud community of Port Adelaide feel?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not talk about that. Instead I will quote Andrew Daniels, who is an Australian Submarine Corporation worker—has been for years. He is a proud worker with amazing skills. He said this yesterday in the media:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We're being trashed. When I go home to my family and this guy—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">the defence minister—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">is telling me I'm useless ... I don't feel useless and that's pretty gutting to 3,000 workers in South Australia and Western Australia. It's not a great feeling to have your Defence Minister, you're out there doing your best job for the country and he's trashing you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is trashing them and that is not good. This minister does not even have the grace to apologise properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister in question time today said this minister had apologised and withdrawn his remarks. That is just not true. The only person I have heard this minister apologise to in the last 24 hours is the Liberal Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Steven Marshall, who—as the member for Batman said—thinks that this defence minister has pretty much satisfied the criteria for resignation or sacking. He said this minister's position was 'untenable'. And it is untenable. Any veneer of objectivity in the extremely important job of deciding that next generation of submarines project has utterly gone now. This minister is clearly committed to giving these jobs overseas to Japan. He must go or be sacked. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  There you have it! Getting lessons from Labor on ministerial accountability is a bit like getting lesson on ethics from Eddie Obeid, or lessons from Stephen Smith about how to treat ADFA commandants, or lessons from Stephen Conroy on how to treat Lieutenant-Generals in Senate estimates, or lessons from Kevin Rudd on team building perhaps. So thank you for those lessons. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this MPI reveals is that Labor remains in a miasma of denial. They are damned by their own record of the most appalling dysfunction during six years of Labor and Labor-Greens government—and not just dysfunction but destruction of the Defence portfolio. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the member for Fadden talk about 16 reshuffles. Labor had three defence ministers during their six years. I know that, because I worked to all three of them. We had the member for Hunter, who did not serve his turn; he left after admitting he did not comply with the ministerial code of conduct. We had Senator Faulkner, who left 12 months later—very soon after Kevin Rudd had been politically knifed by the current Leader of the Opposition. We had Stephen Smith, who spent most of his tenure manning the ATM, scratching the fiscal itch; whenever Penny Wong and Wayne Swan called for it he would ring up the Defence ATM and hand over the dollars—$16 billion of defence funding. So when you come into this place and you talk about ministerial accountability, pause for a moment and reflect on your record. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the member for Hunter and the Cessnock conference—the grand bargain between Defence and the Labor government of the day. It was reliant on government providing real increases in the defence budget of three per cent between 2009 and 2017-18; 2.2 per cent beyond 2017-18 to 2030—and they said they would give them a deal on indexation. Then they said to Defence: 'Your part of this grand bargain is to come up with $20 billion of internal savings'—about eight to 10 per cent of their budget, year on year. Yet here they are complaining about 4.4 per cent from the ABC, and they impose 10 per cent on Defence, year on year, for a decade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the combined effects of those two things—government investment in defence and the $20 billion in savings—was meant to deliver something called Force 2030—do you remember that? It was 12 submarines the famous Rudd-pluck of 12 submarines, determined on the back of the same envelope that the NBN plan was written on. It is little wonder that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has referred to the defence budget under that mob as an unsustainable mess. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened with incredulity earlier today when the Leader of the Opposition had the temerity to come into this place and talk about submarines. In six years they failed to progress SEA 1000; six years, and not even first pass approval; no contracts or key milestones achieved; no meaningful work at all. </span>

                  </a>  Cost overruns on the Air Warfare Destroyer of plus-$360 million, and two years overdue. So, if you want to talk about legacies, I love talking about Labor's legacy when it comes to defence. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's approach to defence projects was all about delay and obfuscation. It was about insufficient resources. It was about constantly changing plans. Who can ever forget that wonderful campaign promise by the former Leader of the Labor Party, Kevin Rudd, to move the entire Navy from Garden Island to Brisbane? Can we all remember that? If that is not ministerial irresponsibility, I do not know what is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The results of Labor's inaction on things like the submarine project are plain for all to see: the potential for the Collins class submarines to reach the end of their usable life when the new subs are not ready. That is called a capability gap, and that is a capability gap that you cannot fill easily. The Leader of the Opposition says: 'If we were in government, here is what we would do with all these projects'. Well, you had six years, and what did you do? You ruined this country economically, diplomatically and militarily. So spare us your sanctimonious lectures. Admit your considerable failings and get out of our way as we fix your mess. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:50</span>):  Talk about 'spare us the sanctimonious lectures'! Not once did the speaker mention the minister's name, and this is all about the performance, or the lack thereof, of the Minister for Defence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw last night and over the past 24 hours from the Minister for Defence is absolutely outrageous. His comments were a complete kick in the guts to the highly skilled and dedicated workers of the AFC—and not just the AFC; a range of industries support the AFC in South Australia. There are hundreds and hundreds of workers in industries throughout South Australia who were supporting those workers. What the minister did last night was kick them in the guts. We heard from the former speaker about what it actually felt like to be one of those workers, to hear the minister's view of those workers. It is absolutely outrageous. It is complete kick in the guts and a complete insult. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia expects more from its defence minister. Australia expects more, particularly when we are dealing with capability that is incredibly significant for the nation's security. And we are talking about jobs that are incredibly significant for the nation's security—3,000 South Australian workers, and what did he do to them last night? He gave them a significant kick in the guts. And it is not just them; it is also the families of these people that go, each day, and do great work in supporting capability to defend our nation </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you think those families thought when those people came home? It is absolutely outrageous. And, as the member for Batman said, what about the families of those submariners who are out there serving the country, defending our nation, doing it tough away from their families? Imagine how their mothers felt; imagine how their fathers felt; imagine how their brothers and sisters felt when they heard that the organisation that is there to support the capability that they are serving the nation in could not build a canoe. How outrageous were those comments from the minister. How insulting. What a kick in the guts to workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This minister has form on this. We have seen what he has done in terms of ADF pay and conditions—cutting ADF pay and conditions so that the pay deal that has been offered by this minister and this government is below inflation. It means that these people are expected to basically take a pay cut. And it is not just that. It is the cut to conditions that is even more insulting—hard-fought-for conditions after many, many years. These include cuts to recreation leave, cuts to Christmas leave and cuts to opportunities for families who have not seen each other throughout the year to get together. That has all gone as a result of what this minister and this government has done in the outrageous pay deal—the slap in the face that you have delivered through the ADF pay deal and the cut to conditions, as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have until 1 December to turn back this ridiculous decision. We have been calling on you to reverse this decision and to reverse these cuts to pay and conditions. The ADF community has been calling on you to do it. We have been calling on you to do it. Are you going to make a reversal of that decision by 1 December? Time is running out, everyone. Are you listening to your constituents? Are you listening to the ADF members in your electorates? Are you listening to the families and the children of those ADF members? They are outraged. What they are most outraged by is the fact that they see this as them being part of collateral damage when the real target is cuts to pay and conditions for public servants. These guys just see themselves as, absolutely, collateral damage in the real quest to cut the conditions and pay for public servants. You have until 1 December to reverse the decision. Reverse that decision, listen to your constituents, listen to the ADF members, listen to the families and listen to the children of those families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend—although I do not know whether those opposite actually took any notice—there was a major rally in Townsville. Two hundred people turned out—ADF members in civilian clothes, ADF family members and parents of ADF members. They were absolutely outraged at what you have done on this. They are going to maintain the fight. The DFWA is going to maintain the fight. The RSL is going to maintain the fight. ADF members and their families right across Australia are going to maintain the fight. And we will maintain the fight to ensure that ADF members and their families get decent pay and conditions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  It is a privilege to be able to participate in this debate, moved by the good member for Batman, on sacking ministers. The member for Batman has a lot of form in not only sacking ministers but actually sacking prime ministers. So we should go back: we are now a little over 12 months in to cleaning up the mess from the worst, most incompetent and most dysfunctional government in our nation's history. Across every portfolio, every minister that has come into their portfolio has had an absolutely diabolical mess to clean up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to, perhaps, pose the question: which minister has inherited the greatest mess and has had the greatest problems with what they have had to clean up? I will start with the Treasurer. We should remember that the past financial year was the year that the budget was meant to be in surplus. We can remember the former Treasurer standing at the dispatch box and saying 'the four years of surpluses I announce tonight' and 'this budget delivers a surplus'. Well, we know what happened. There was no surplus; there was a deficit—a $48 billion deficit. Then we could look at the Minister for Small Business. What was the mess that he inherited? There are 500,000 fewer jobs in the small business sector and 3,000 fewer small businesses employing people after this mess. Or perhaps we could look at the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has been trying to clean up the debacle of a previous minister whose main concerns were about whether he had silk pyjamas, about traveling first class or about the quality of the meal in business class. Or we could look at the Minister for Communications. He had to clean up the mess of the NBN, with a catastrophic blow-out of $29 billion. Or perhaps we could look at the Minister for Education and the mess that he has had to clean up. Under Labor's reign, according to the World Economic Forum, our educational standards in this country slipped from eighth in the world all the way back to 23rd. And then we have the ministers for industry and the environment. They have had to clean up the mess of the carbon tax, which put Australia's industry at a competitive disadvantage. And then, of course, the minister for immigration could also challenge for the award.</span>

You come in here and you cry these crocodile tears when you were responsible for $16 billion worth of cuts from Defence. You reduced Defence expenditure in this nation to the lowest level since 1938, when Neville Chamberlain stood up and said, 'There will be peace in our time'.

What a debacle. Not only that, we have an obligation to pay the interest on the debt that this mob ran up. Every single month we must pay $1 billion in interest.

Last year the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston, said on 8 May 2013: 'We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia.' He said, 'The coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide.' It was no slip of the tongue. It was said very deliberately, because the submarine contract mattered to South Australia in the period leading up to the election. It was indeed a key South Australian federal election issue. The minister at the time knew that and made that commitment in order to try to win votes in South Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting, as we debate this, that there is not a South Australian Liberal member of parliament here in the chamber to support the workers of South Australia. I remind those South Australian federal Liberal MPs that we on this side of the House will remind the voters of South Australia—right through to the next election—about the commitment made by Minister Johnston in 2013. They can rest assured of that. We will remind them, because it is another broken promise of the Abbott government for South Australia.</span>

The Abbott government is now trying to shift the promise from 'We will build the submarines in South Australia,' to 'The work will be centred around South Australia.' We heard the word 'centred' used by the Prime Minister today in answer to a question from me and others on this side of the House.</span>

                  </a>  As the member for Batman said, it is deceitful, because the words were 'We will build them there.' It is part of their mantra and it will not wash with the people of South Australia. Even worse—and quite disgracefully—the minister has now embarked on a narrative of trashing the ASC in South Australia. First, he said it will cost $60 billion to $80 billion to build the submarines in South Australia—without ever giving any figures or discussing the matter with them—and then he talked about the disgraceful mess regarding the Air Warfare Destroyer program, knowing full well that most of the reasons for the cost blow-out were matters beyond the control of the ASC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, when he said, 'Do you wonder why I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe here?' he simply went too far. The comments are insulting, they are ignorant, they are ill informed and they offend the thousands of workers of that industry—workers, engineers and designers—who know that is simply not true. The problem is, he will not even commit to an open-tender process. If he were a fair minister on this issue why would he not commit to an open-tender process and allow everyone to put in their bids? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will quickly go to another matter. Last year, the Prime Minister visited Japan in April. In June, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the Defence minister went to Japan. In August, the Prime Minister of Japan visited Australia. Also in August a Japanese delegation visited the ASC facilities, in South Australia, for undisclosed purposes. It may be just coincidence, but it begs the question: what backroom deals were done by the Prime Minister to secure the Japan-Australia free trade agreement, and was the submarine contract part of those deals?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is indeed a serious matter. It goes to the heart of Australia's national security. It commits Australia to tens of billions of dollars of government expenditure and it affects the jobs of thousands of Australians. Most importantly, it is critical to Australia's Defence manufacturing capability. Senator Johnston, not just through his comments yesterday but also through a series of actions since the election, has shown himself to be incompetent. He is now a lame-duck defence minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of Australia's national security is far too important to be entrusted to a defenceless minister, and the Prime Minister should cut him adrift. That is what this motion seeks to do. I assure members opposite that I have had emails from people in South Australia who are as outraged about the minister's comments as we are on this side of the House. The Prime Minister should take note of what people are saying out there in the community.</span>

But that is not good enough for the opposition because they are Mr and Mrs Negativity. What is Labor's record on defence? We have heard it from other members, and I will not go into it all again, but we know that they launched a defence white paper and then cut $16 billion out of defence. Many new members are sitting around me here. We made the decision to run for our seats in parliament because of your past performance, because of the cuts that you made to defence and the many, many things that you did—and you have the gall to come in here and raise this in an MPI debate. Under Labor, defence spending dropped to 1.56 per cent, the lowest since 1938. We have made a commitment to invest in defence. We will continue to do so and ensure taxpayers' money is spent well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  In World War II they had posters that said 'Loose lips sink ships', and we have got a defence minister with the loosest lips in the history of the Federation! Unfortunately, this is all part of the form of the Liberal Party, who have been undermining the Collins class submarine, one of the best diesel electric submarines in the world, since the 1990s. In the 1990s they went after the then Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, who is now the Australian Ambassador to the United States, in a totally partisan attack. They went after the Collins class submarine to undermine the then Leader of the Opposition. And now they are after the Collins class submarine again, they are after the ASC again, they are after workers again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have got form on this. This is no mere 'rhetorical flourish' as it was described by the defence minister this morning on 891 ABC. This minister is a blackguard. He is out to get workers, he is out to get the Collins class submarine, he is out to get the ASC and he is out to get South Australia. Loose lips sink ships. The minister is sinking fast because he tried to attack national institutions and he tried to attack workers. He was a bit too smart, a bit too full on, a bit too hot headed in the Senate yesterday. And what do we see? All of this damage. And what do you lot do? There is not one South Australian in the room. We have to roll out these Tasmanians to defend the minister—and even they do not mention the minister's name!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHAMPION:</span>
                  </a>  I will tell you what South Australians think. The Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Mr Marshall, says the minister's position is untenable and he should resign. Mr Briggs, the member for Mayo, says he is wrong. Senator Birmingham says there are no excuses for the behaviour, no excuses for the language. Mr Southcott said Senator Johnston's comments were 'deeply regrettable, unhelpful and wrong'. Even Senator Edwards—who let me tell you sticks with the Liberal Party through thick and thin; I have been on the receiving end of some of his campaigning—says there should be an open tender and he has full confidence in the workers at ASC. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> the 'unknown' Liberals say that it is bizarre, breathtaking, stupid. That is what they say about this minister—'bizarre, breathtaking, stupid'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are some good Liberals around the place. I beat one of them in 2007. His name is David Fawcett. He is the bloke who should be defence minister. He knows more about defence than all of you. It is a great pity that he is not in the chamber today—well, it is not such a pity; I am glad he is in the Senate! He should be defence minister. He has called for an open tender. He knows how damaging this minister is, he knows how important this submarines decision is and he knows how good the Collins class submarine is. But it is not just all of us in this debate. Hugh White, from the ANU, said the minister could not actually articulate the reasons why we are in Iraq. That is what Hugh White says. Jim Molan went on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bolt Report</span> and praised everybody but the minister. When Andrew Bolt said, You seem to be pointing to the minister, David Johnston.' He said, 'Well I do not really want to go into that. I will say what I need to say privately.' That is what is going on. We know what he said. We know this minister is absent from the national security council. He is cutting pay. And we know he is a loose lipped minister. He is a foolish minister. He is a hot-headed minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has to choose between this foolish idiot as a Defence minister and workers, the national interest, our sub mariners, the ASC, shipbuilding workers and the national institution. He has to choose between an incompetent minister and the national interest. That is the choice here. None of you have done a particularly good job of defending Minister Johnston because you all know loose lips sink ships. Johnson has to go.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  The sheer hypocrisy of this MPI. All this MPI succeeds in doing is highlighting the double standards shown by the opposition when it comes to deciding what is deemed worthy in regards to sacking someone. The nerve of those opposite to talk about witness protection programs. Let's talk about your witness protection programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all heard of Craig Thomson, who is currently awaiting sentencing for fraud with 65 convictions. We talk about 'loose lips sink ships'. Craig Thompson is a classic example of 'those in glass houses should not throw stones'. What about Peter Slipper? Those opposite in the Labor Party supported someone who forged documents to line his own pockets, effectively stealing from taxpayers. What did those opposite do? They did the same thing they did for Craig Thomson—they defended him at every opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to sacking people, Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, has been very keen to sack people. He stabbed in the back poor Julia and he stabbed in the back poor Kevin. I have never seen a union hack so keen on the idea of unfair dismissal. What a wonderful example the former member for Dobell and the opposition have set for the hypocrisy of today's MPI subject.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This MPI is also a chance to highlight the lack of interest shown in Defence by the opposition when previously in government. No investment in Defence spelt 1.56 per cent of the GDP. The year 2012-13 was the lowest level of Defence funding since 1938. I would like to point out which Prime Minister was in charge during this disgusting abandonment of our Defence portfolio but it is just too confusing because during the time of the chaos there were two Prime Ministers, three Deputy Prime Minister's—the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are all aware that on the opposition's watch the 10.5 per cent cut in the 2012-13 budget was the biggest since the Korean conflict. And another example of the opposition's refusal to sack a member of their party would be their highly unsuccessful border protection policies. Was the Minister for Immigration sacked when on his watch more than 50,000 illegals arrived and more than 800 boats? Were moves made to sack any member of the opposition when Labor's failed border protection policies caused a budget blow-out of $11 billion? What about when tragically 1,100 drownings occurred at sea on Labor's watch? The list goes on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fine example of the hypocrisy of calling for the sack of our hard-working minister—and I will name him, David Johnston—is the opposition's failure to make decisions. Six years is how long the opposition failed to make a decision on the protection capability of our country. And that is as long as it takes for a student to go from year 7 to year 12 in high school. This was six years of jobs uncertainty, six years of empty promises and Defence spending cuts. Perhaps the opposition should look at its own failures and mess before trying to create make-believe stories about issues and policy they obviously know nothing about, proven by their failures during their time in government. But luckily for the Australian people, the Abbott government takes Defence and national security seriously. More importantly, Australian people now have a Minister for Defence—and I will name him again, David Johnston—who understands how critical a strong Defence Force is for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of sitting around twiddling thumbs and staring at ageing ships in need of replacement, we are taking steps to ensure our Navy is properly equipped and providing the Australian shipbuilding industry with a long-term strategic direction it lacked during the years under Labor's rule. Instead of stripping nearly $20 billion out of the future submarine program, we are concentrating on an affordable and deliverable plan to ensure that the huge national investment in a viable defence capability is done properly. The coalition is ensuring that Australia has the military capability to deter threats and to protect our forces in our neighbourhood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The vital need for a strong credible Defence approach is even more important to me since observing Operation Resolute earlier this year. It was there that I witnessed first-hand the outstanding job that our men and women do in our armed services. Having observed and been part of Operation Resolute, I am in awe of the professionalism, commitment and dedication of the men and women tasked to protect our borders. This is why I am proud to be part of a government which makes the right decisions for the right reasons. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  As I was saying, all of these industries are of major importance to the Australian economy and are indeed growing in size and importance. The master of a ship or pilot of any aircraft may also bring the ship or aircraft to a place other than a port or airport due to the stress of weather or other reasonable cause. Extending customs control and examination powers to these non-proclaimed places will minimise the risks that these activities may pose. In short, this bill is about addressing the situation that currently exists but also situations that become an issue in the future. For example, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that at some point in the future the epidemic of people-smuggling by boat could become an epidemic of people-smuggling by small light plane. Given the many hundreds of small islands and remote areas around Australia, this is not impossible. However, with the vision and planning of this government, we are slamming the door shut in the face of people smugglers. We are taking the sugar off the table before it has even been placed on the table, literally saying to the people smugglers and other nefarious types intent on doing no good, 'Don't even think about it.' This bill is consistent with everything the coalition has done in government. It is consistent with our plan, our contract with the Australian people. In the final analysis, this bill is consistent with our mission to continue to restore hope, reward and opportunity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is an important one. There are a number of specific provisions of this bill that I will come to shortly and commend to the House. But it is important to explain to the House the very sorry state of affairs that this government inherited in the area of customs and border protection, because we saw six years of abject failure by those opposite in this area. Of course we are all very familiar with the failings in the area of border protection and illegal boat arrivals, but it is also very important to comment on the failure to screen goods whose entry into Australia was being sought during the period of the previous government. And under the previous Minister for Home Affairs and Justice we saw an appalling degradation of the capacity of our border security at Customs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might recall that back in 2012 we saw an appalling instance of this with the arrival of a large gun shipment that came through Customs and actually showed up at a post office in Sydney, in Sylvania Waters, not far from my electorate of Banks. Understandably, this concerned the community immensely, because the whole point of having a customs and border protection service is to stop this sort of contraband getting into this country. We must stop the flow of illegal guns. We must stop drugs and other illegal merchandise before it gets into the country. You would think that there would be unanimity on that point of view, and you would think that even the most incompetent of governments would commit resources to addressing this fundamental issue, but the last government failed in a spectacular fashion in this space. As the New South Wales Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione, said, Customs is not just a border security issue; it is a national security issue, because if you do not control the flow of goods at the borders, how do you know what is coming in? And if you do not know what is coming in, you do not know what is coming in. What that means is that there is every chance that criminals will seek to exploit that weakness—and of course that is exactly what they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a look at some of the failings of the previous government in this area, and I will come in a moment to how in our time in government we have addressed these incredible blunders. One of the first things that Labor did was to cut staff in Customs. There was a substantial cut in staff in Customs, from 5,700 to 5,000, and this was at a time when, because of the flow of illegal boat arrivals appearing on the horizon on an almost daily basis—and sometimes more than one a day—Customs was already under immense pressure. A sensible government would stop the flow of boat arrivals; a government that was less sensible but at least conscious of the issues would not cut the staff to address Customs problems when they were in fact increasing so dramatically. We have heard a lot about so-called budget cuts, but what about the cuts that Labor made to Customs, totalling over $700 million out to 2017-18—that is about three-quarters of a billion dollars in the area of Customs. And again, this is an area that is so fundamental to our national security, so how could a responsible government not seek to put its best foot forward in this space?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did become aware in recent years of allegations of extensive corruption within the customs service, and these allegations were aired as early as 2007. People came forward to the previous government and said, 'There is a real concern about potential criminality at our ports and the involvement of criminal cartels and so on.' But what did the previous government do? Well, they did not do anything until late in 2012, when the Minister for Home Affairs—in his Hollywood fashion—put out a big announcement and press release and said that investigations would be conducted. But it would have been good to conduct those investigations back in 2007 when the issue was first brought to the attention of the government. Again, they did not do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other extraordinary thing that occurred was the huge cut in the screening of sea cargo. Of course, sea cargo is the most common form by which illegal contraband goods get into the country. Sea cargo has a capacity for volume that is more difficult in airborne cargo. Labor's approach here was also novel. In an environment where there are allegations of corruption within Customs on their watch and an environment where we know that there is a huge increase in the demands upon Customs because of all the chaos that is going on at the borders, what Labor said was, 'You know what we should do? Let's dramatically reduce the amount of cargo that we screen.' This is really quite extraordinary. In the 2009-10 budget, back in those days of Labor, there was a cut to the Customs cargo screening program of $58 million. That was an extraordinary act by the government in a long litany of incompetencies. But they actually cut the budget for the screening of sea cargo, when as a society and a nation one of our highest priorities must be to ensure that illegal goods, guns, drugs and all the other terrible things that unfortunately criminals try to peddle in our society are kept out. You do not to that by dramatically cutting the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The result of the cutting the budget to cargo screening is quite instructive. It is very instructive indeed. Under the Howard government, 60 per cent of air cargo consignments were expected. That was more than half. Under Labor, five per cent of air cargo consignments were inspected. The difference is so dramatic that it beggars belief, but it is accurate. Sixty per cent of air cargo consignments were screened under the Howard government and five per cent were screened by the end of Labor's term, which is just an extraordinary dereliction of duty on the part of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a very significant drop in sea cargo inspections. The ratio of reductions is about 40 per cent, relative to what was inspected before. Less than one per cent of sea cargo under Labor was physically examined. Less than one in 100 items of sea cargo were actually examined. So if you are a criminal, you are think, 'Gee, can we get some illegal goods into this country?' They have probably got a 99 per cent chance that no-one is going to look. Physical examinations were 0.5 per cent. About 3½ per cent were inspected in some way. But physical examinations were of one in 200 items of sea cargo by the end of Labor's term in office. That is really just absolutely appalling. They were going to create a department of homeland security. It was all very grand. It did not happen. It was quietly dumped a little bit after the election. They promised a coast guard. Again, it was a nice announcement prior to the 2007 election, but it did not happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is just a record of abject failure. The failures in relation to physical cargo were more than matched by the failures of the previous government in relation to border security more generally. We know the numbers. More than 50,000 illegal arrivals happened under the previous Labor party's watch. There was a cavalcade of ministers going through the revolving door there. You had the member for Watson, who had a go; the member for McMahon and the member for Gorton—various others were tried out. It was just a colossal failure. It was at a budget cost of about $11.6 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABS says that there is about nine million households in Australia. A $11.6 billion blow-out works out at about $1,300 for every household in Australia. That was the cost of that border protection failure under Labor. The option for the previous government was, if it was to have taken a truthful approach to the 2007 campaign, it could have said, 'All right, here are your options. We will just leave things as they are—that was working very successfully under Prime Minister Howard, the member for Berowra and others—or you can adopt a radically different approach under us, which will lead to 50,000 illegal arrivals and a cost to the average household of about $1,300.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is important, because imagine what the average household could do with $1,300 if there were provided with tax relief. That would be if there was competence at our borders. If there was competence at our borders, there would not have been the $11 billion budget blow-out. If there was not the $11 billion budget blow-out, there would not have been an impact of about $1,300 per household. But, unfortunately, all of that did happen and the cost was $1,300 per household. We know that ,despite the extraordinarily sanctimonious arguments we hear from those opposite, the human cost of their policies on the border were appalling. I will leave that at that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we discussed today has a number of important provisions. It is good to see the Minister for Immigration here as we discuss these matters. There are important provisions under the Customs Amendment Bill. One of the anomalies in the existing law is that domestic travellers on a domestic leg of an international flight are not subject to inspection. That is not logical. We should fix that and that is what this bill does. If you are on a domestic leg of an international flight, Customs will now have the power to inspect that cargo. That is entirely appropriate, because there is obviously an intermingling of domestic and international passengers in those situations and an intermingling of domestic and international cargo. We need to be able to put a stop to any use of domestic flights to bring illegal substances into the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important provision in the bill is this change to allow Customs to inspect goods at what are known as non-proclaimed places. Non-proclaimed places is essentially a fancy term that basically means a place that is not on the list of usual ports of embarkation. It is your airports, your major ports and so on. Sometimes, companies seek to bringing goods at other locations—sometimes cruise liners, sometimes in the resources industry and so on. Unfortunately, under the current act, Customs does not have the power to inspect goods in those non-proclaimed places. This bill will make that change and enable Customs to go to those non-proclaimed places and conduct inspections as appropriate. This is particularly important because if you were trying to get illegal goods into the country, you may well go to a non-proclaimed place. By extending the power of Customs to those non-proclaimed places we extend its reach, and that is absolutely appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also have simpler rules about the transferring of goods between different vessels, and so on, at the borders. Obviously, the point of transfer between different transport means is a point of vulnerability in the system, and it is important that there is a good system of permissions for those transfers, which all occur under the watchful eye of Customs, and that nothing is lost in the process. We also want to introduce some additional flexibility into the reporting of goods that are to come in to the country to give Customs greater visibility of what shipping companies and others are planning, and therefore ensuring that the right Customs resources are there when the goods arrive. These are great changes that move away from the era of appalling management of this space, which we saw under Labor. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

Processing of visas will recommence for residents of the Democratic Republic of Congo after the World Health Organisation declared the west African nation Ebola free. Last month, the government announced stronger border control measures, temporarily suspending processing of all visa applications for applicants from Ebola virus disease affected countries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pleasing that the outbreak has ended in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to the World Health Organisation, this outbreak resulted in a total of 66 cases, including eight health workers. This decision by the WHO will allow the over 200 visa applications, which have been paused, to be processed by my department. The government's strict health screening requirements for other Ebola affected countries in Africa remain in place. Australians travelling home are urged to alert our border officers if they have been in any of the Ebola affected countries in Africa up to 21 days prior to their arrival, and provide details of their travel history as requested. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recently rolled out a new travel history card to facilitate this, and this information at the border will assist other agencies, including the Department of Health, to ensure that Australia remains Ebola free. These arrangements may inconvenience some travellers; however, the safety of the Australian community is paramount, and it is critical that Australia is not exposed to this disease. The government remains committed to protecting Australians and ensuring our border measures remain strong. I thank the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I would like to speak on the Customs Amendment Bill 2014. This bill builds on the good work already undertaken by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon. Scott Morrison, in this portfolio area. It is another example of how the coalition government is maintaining a steady hand on the reins of government and focusing on getting the job done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the amendments in this bill are mostly minor, they seek to update what is essentially a Federation era act to ensure that the guardians of one of Australia's most important assets, its border, are legislatively equipped to best fulfil their duties. It begins to lay the very early groundwork for the merger of Customs and Immigration and the Australian Border Force subsequent to its establishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this bill seeks to do six things. Firstly, it allows for class based authorisations to include offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. Secondly, it extends Customs controls to those places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act. Thirdly, it will provide for greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia, and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. Fourthly, it seeks to improve the application processes for several permissions under the act. This legislation will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. Fifthly, it provides an extension of Custom's powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages, and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage. Sixthly, it provides an enhancement of the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sensitive bill that fixes up a bit more of Labor's mess from their time in government. In this case, it involves border protection as it relates to Customs. Before I proceed, I would like to use this opportunity to remind the House that the previous Labor government's border protection failure was not limited to their incompetence when it came to the illegal boat arrivals. As the member for Banks told us, that was some 50,000 people and cost this country $11 billion. Can you imagine what $11 billion would have done to enhance customs and border protection? The opposition would not have had to make the cuts that they enacted while they were in government for six years. That $11 billion could have added to the protection and scrutiny of our borders and those coming across our borders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor had remained in government over $734.8 million—or close to three quarters of a billion dollars—would have been cut from the Customs budget over the forward estimates. That is their own figures. These cuts would have followed the 700 job losses that had occurred in Customs under Labor. In other words, they had a 12 per cent cut in the workforce. And they want to talk about efficiency dividends in the ABC! They had a 12 per cent cut in the workforce, and a $58.1 million cut in the 2009-10 budget for the Customs cargo-screening program. These cuts resulted in the reduction of 25 per cent in sea cargo inspection and a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo inspections, despite an increase in imports </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the previous speaker told us, it went from 60 per cent of air cargo inspections during the Howard government era to five per cent under Labor, because of the cuts. They pulled the budget on them so they could not do the job. Sea cargo inspections went from 40 per cent to 3½ per cent. The $11 billion that was squandered on changing a program that had fixed our borders to finding a solution to unfix them could have been used to fund proper scrutiny of our borders. As I said, the inspection of sea containers is one of the most disgraceful things. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that as a maritime country, Australia relies on exports and imports into the country by sea and by air, but the number of physical inspections of the massive containers that come through our ports got down to 3½ per cent and less. We heard that a half per cent of them were physically inspected. If you want to be a crim and bring stuff into this country, the best way is to play 'container lotto', and make sure that you bring it in by container, because you know that your chances of being caught are pretty remote. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that over $44 million was cut from Australia's international passenger facilitation program. This has continued to put our Customs officers under the pump in intercepting contraband and prohibited items, simply because they have had their funding pulled. To call what Labor did to Australia's border services a failure is probably being generous, because in actual fact Labor's attitude towards Customs was the same blase attitude that it took towards Defence and national security; it was itself a form of negligence. That attitude, as we know, came right from the top—remember: Rudd-Gillard-Rudd. On 24 January last year, Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that the 9/11 decade was over. David Wroe of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Gillard said the behaviour of countries would once again dominate Australia's national security thinking, ending an era in which ''non-state actors'', such as terrorist groups, posed the greatest risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a way to base your international policy on the assumptions about what is a happening overseas rather than making sure you actually do the job properly here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is 18 months later, and the greatest risk to Australia right now is radicalised extremists returning to Australia and to the South-East Asian region, spreading their hate and seeking to harm Australia, its citizens and their interests. An article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> published on 21 of August by Peter Alford quotes Indonesia saying that officially there are 50 Indonesians fighting in Iraq and Syria and at risk of return. However, the article points out that some security experts place that number at 500—10 times the official figure. There has been a good working relationship between our countries, and I have the greatest confidence in the ability of both Indonesia and Malaysia to counter such threats. In a world so uncertain, Australia cannot afford to be found sleeping at the wheel—and that is what we were doing under the previous government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have told you where the problem was; now I am going to tell you what we are doing about it. Since coming to government, the coalition has turned around the fiscal position of Customs and Border Protection. As previously stated, on 1 July 2015, the Australian Border Force will be established as part of the amalgamation of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Not only will this amalgamation see costs relating to the duplication of back-of-house operations reduced; it will also allow the department and specifically the ABF to focus their resources on front-line operations, protecting Australians and keeping our borders secure. The coalition government will be delivering a $480 million package, which will include $98 million for enforcement operations and supplement the acquisition of six additional patrol vessels to the tune of $249.6 million, to support the National Border Targeting Centre to develop and advance its intelligence capability and systems; over $70 million to establish a Trusted Trader framework to reward those individuals who do the right thing and allow the ADF to focus their resources on high-risk areas; and a $53.6 million allowance for the consolidation of workforce and the establishment of an ABF college. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are on that, one of the ways that Customs does its job is by profiling. If you are a passenger coming through the airport—and we have all done this—you wonder why they stand there and look at you and say, 'You go that way and you go this way. You go and get your bag searched. You keep going through.' It is because nine times out of 10 they have done a profile on you before you have even got there. If you have come from a country where there is a high risk of people wanting to do nefarious things, it is a good chance that you will go to the bag search area. If you have got a clean criminal record in Australia and you have not been involved in drugs or any bad behaviour, they will probably send you along with the majority of people—straight out the front. This profiling was reduced. As we said, the intelligence capability of the systems were reduced by Labor cuts, but we are putting money back into it. We are taking the threats to border security seriously, and the investment this government is making, combined with the measures that we are taking to strengthen our legislative instruments, as in this amendment, are crucial to keeping our borders safe. I could go through other issues, but, as the other speakers have done that rather well, I will not take the time of the House to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I want to conclude by saying a few things. The amendments contained within this bill seek to bring about a common sense approach to the problems that the Australian Customs and Border Protection Services faces on an almost daily basis. This is another example of how the coalition is keeping a tight grip on the reins of government and, in this particular case, getting on with the job of making our borders secure, not just from illegal entrants but, as I said, at ports and airports and in a whole range of others areas where people wish to enter Australia illegally. We have not even mentioned the fact that, if people want to misbehave and do something illegal, they do not necessarily come through the front door of an airport. They might find some remote airstrip somewhere in the Northern Territory or elsewhere. We have also seen people arriving at desolate and isolated spots on our coast, which also need border protection. We know customs has planes to do this; we know that customs is even interested in heading towards the use of drones to do this—because that is the modern way of surveillance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have stopped the boats; we are shutting down the detention centres; we are going to save those billions of dollars a year. We have not heard the latest figure, but I do know that so far there has only been one boat that is reached Australia in the last 12 months—compared to 350 or thereabouts in the same period of time. That is, one boat compared to so many boats and 20,000 people in the community who Labor is still trying to stop us from processing, and that is still costing us money though it is costing us a darn sight less than when Labor was in charge of the Treasury benches. We have stopped deaths at sea and we are taking children out of the detention centres. It really makes you grimace when you hear our critics talking about children in detention—we are taking them out; we are educating them; we are paying for them to go to school in detention centres, unlike the previous government. We are doing something to fix up the mess we inherited. We are doing what we said we would do and we are delivering on what we said we would do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall vividly before the last federal election, as I went around my electorate doorknocking, people said to me: 'You can't stop them—the gate's open—there's no way in the world that you guys will be able to stop them.'</span>

Australia's extensive exclusive economic zone covers 8.1 million square kilometres. We have a sparsely populated continent with a significant number of remote towns, where only basic port and airport facilities exist, without the advanced security found in capital cities. It is in this context that the task of monitoring our borders and controlling the international flow of passengers and goods represents a massive undertaking for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By improving our border protection capabilities to intercept contraband and the smuggling of illegal cargo—such as drugs, weapons, and materials subject to quarantine—we will be able to combat transnational crime, preserve the biosecurity of our agricultural industry and promote greater national security. This bill seeks to make a number of relatively minor technical amendments to the Customs Act of 1901, which will serve to close a number of loopholes that could potentially allow illicit cargo and prohibited items to go undetected or be transferred from vessels and aircraft within Australian jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The anticipated future increase in the flow of passengers and goods across international borders is brought about by the emerging economies in our region with increased international trade facilitated by free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China. Trade is projected to increase further as a free trade agreement is expected to be reached with India and as Australia develops stronger economic partnerships with the 10 member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, and beyond. Our customs service must be adequately prepared and resourced to cope with the increased demands encountered at all entry points to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most significant of the proposed amendments are designed to allow customs officers to examine domestic goods carried on domestic legs of international flights. Currently, under section 30 of the act, customs control does not extend to domestic goods, which include domestic cargo or personal effects of domestic travellers once they are loaded onto or unloaded from international ships and aircraft. Section 186 of the act does not adequately provide for the examination of domestic goods on domestic legs of international flights and voyages. In practice, domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the customs controlled areas of ports and airports and mix with international travellers prior to, during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage. Domestic cargo can currently be loaded or unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg without any authority or permission under the act. The bill seeks to correct this anomaly by granting customs officers the necessary powers to examine domestic goods carried on domestic legs of international flights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key aspect of the bill proposes that customs control be extended to goods on board a ship which docks or an aircraft which lands at any place in Australia that is not a designated port or airport </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the act does not extend Customs control to goods which are on board a ship or an aircraft at a place other than a designated port or airport in Australia. From time to time it may be necessary for vessels or aircraft to dock or land at places on the Australian mainland due to adverse weather conditions or other reasonable causes under section 58(1) of the act, or if the master of a ship or the pilot of an aircraft has received permission from a collector to bring the ship or aircraft to land under section 58(2) of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, the cruise ship industry regularly seeks permission to visit non-proclaimed areas of the Australian coastline, and the stopover may involve disembarking travellers or unloading goods in these locations where government agencies do not have a presence. Goods on board a ship or aircraft in these circumstances are not currently subject to Customs control and cannot, therefore, be examined by an officer of Customs under section 186. To ensure that border risks and intervention activities can be managed appropriately, it is proposed that Customs control be extended to goods on board a ship or aircraft at the place to which the ship or aircraft has been brought under the circumstances covered in sections 58(1) or 58(2) of the act. Item 5 repeals and substitutes section 31 of the act to ensure that all goods on board a ship or aircraft from a place outside Australia are subject to Customs control while the ship or aircraft is within Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> The bill also contains amendments which add legal certainty to the circumstances in which the Chief Executive Officer of Customs can authorise persons to carry out functions under the act. Currently, the CEO of Customs can authorise an individual by name or position, or a class of offices or positions, to be authorised officers for the purposes of carrying out functions under particular provisions in the act. Unlike delegations, the law remains ambiguous as to whether an authorisation will apply to future offices or positions created within an authorised class that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The amendment proposes to amend the definition of 'authorised officer' in the act so that authorisations can apply to future offices or positions created. This will preclude the need to update authorisation instruments on a regular basis to ensure that new offices are covered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the bill will improve and make consistent with other parts of the Customs Act the application process for permission to load and unload a ship's and an aircrafts' stores, and for the transfer of goods between certain vessels. The proposed amendments are designed to standardise the application processes in the act by requiring applications for certificates of clearance to be in an approved form. This supports the Australian Customs and Border Protections Service's initiatives to streamline processes and eventually allow applicants to apply for clearance certificates online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. These changes will allow earlier assessment and the planning of resources required if the stores or prohibited goods reported present risks, including the management of firearms, weapons, and narcotics. The bill will also correct a technical error in relation to the interaction of Custom and Border Protection's Infringement Notice Scheme and claims process for seized goods under the Customs Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the measures contained in the Customs Amendment Bill 2014 are designed to incrementally improve the security of our national borders by addressing anomalies in the current system. By giving the Australian Customs and Border Protections Service the necessary powers to examine domestic goods en route to and from international destinations in the circumstances outlined, and at places within Australia other than at ports and airports where foreign vessels or aircraft land, the government can intercept prohibited items, illicit goods, and dutiable items, preventing them from crossing our borders. The bill also ensures that the legislation is brought up to date with current Customs practice, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  In relation to the Customs Amendment Bill 2014, I want to tell the story of what is happening in Townsville at the moment. Townsville has a limited international airport. We want to start new international flights to another destination—say, Bali. To do that, we have to get customs, immigration and quarantine services into Townsville. On a discount-airline basis, it is a very competitive trade. But if we have to fly in these people and all these things, then all the extra costs in this space mean that we are no longer competitive. We previously had that flight when Strategic Airlines did it. To get customs, immigration and quarantine services into Townsville it ended up costing us more on the ground that it did in the air. So it was no longer competitive to come through Townsville to go to Bali. So when we did that, no-one used it and the thing shut down. What we need in Townsville—and this plays into the development of Northern Australia as well—is assistance to get customs, immigration and quarantine services up and running and to get them underway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Scott Morrison and his office have been fantastic to me and to Townsville airport in relation to our discussions in the space. But at every turn I have come up against the problem with the massive cost overruns we have had over the last six years. Our border protection policies, all that sort of stuff, has been in so much strife—$11 billion. No matter what the cost, we have got a real issue when it comes to being able to provide new services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see the member for Solomon in here. The member for Solomon is a valued member of the development of Northern Australia white paper committee. She has been around the north of Australia. She has been to my city of Townsville and she knows what a great place it is, as I know that Darwin is a great place. What the member for Solomon and I are all about is growing the north, growing opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at every level government must balance its budget, and must live within its means. What we have to do is to try to figure out how we are going to get this service up and running when you have to fly in staff and it has to be on a cost recovery basis. So when it gets to trying to get customs, immigration and quarantine services, we are starting from so far behind the starting line that we cannot catch up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Kelly, I heard you in Federation Chamber this morning talking about business. You spoke about going overseas and getting things done and all sorts of stuff about running a business. Up until 2007, Australia, as a business, ran with a great return to the company. We were reinvesting in the company of Australia, of Team Australia. We were getting all our stuff rolled out. We had money in the bank. We were investing for the future. We were able to afford anything. If anything happened, we were able to do that. The GFC hit, and no-one is denying that the GFC caused a lot of pain. I see the communications minister down there sitting at the table. He was the leader of the opposition at the time and he backed the first round of stimulus, as was right. He was also right when he walked away from the second round of stimulus and said that they were going too hard. And they just ran up so much debt. The member for Wentworth, now communications minister, was also right when he said we are losing control of what we are trying to do here. There was too much money going out and there was too much debt. Once you lose control of your cash flow, once your cash flow is going into paying interest instead of paying for other products or paying for upgraded plant and equipment in your business, you lose control of your business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am an auctioneer by trade, and my area of specialisation was in insolvency. I would go into businesses and shut them down, sell off of the plant and equipment, and move on. Just about every insolvency was around cash. If you lose control of your cash flow, you lose control of your business, if your debts are ratcheted up too high. I worked through the Keating recession of the early 1990s, when interest rates were in their 20s, and what really knocked a lot of businesses around was that so much of their working capital went into the business of paying off debt. And that is where we are at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when it comes to the customs, immigration and quarantine services, the Customs Amendment Bill does a whole heap of things. It amends the Customs Act 1901. It is about making sure that we balance our books. It is about making sure that we are living inside our means. It is about making sure that we do have that base from which we can grow. If I had had this opportunity in 2007, it would have been a no-brainer. If I had had the opportunity in 2007 to put an international airport into Townsville or start international flights through Townsville—because we are a limited international airport at the moment—it would have been a no-brainer. We would have done it. Because we had the cash there to say 'Okay, that sounds like a great idea, we will do that.' But now, because of the way things are, money is very tight. So to get $2 million or whatever we need to get started is very hard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the way through, no matter what bill we are talking about—and this is the Customs Amendment Bill 2014—it all comes back to the economy. It all comes back to being able to afford what you want to do. If you have cash in the bank you can do anything you want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember that great Australian story on the ABC on Kerry Packer about his kidney transplant. The great line that he said was: 'The beauty about having cash is you can go anywhere you want. I could have this operation in New York, or Geneva or wherever.' He said that the best bloke to do it was in Sydney. But he said that if you have the cash you make the decisions. If you lose control of your cash, you are not making your own decisions. You are playing catch-up and you are trying to do things you are not supposed to be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I speak about this bill, I speak about living within my means. I speak about making sure that we do live within our means and making sure that everything is affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can just quickly touch on the ABC cuts in relation to this customs bill, because it all comes back to what you do with your cash. When you make your decisions, when you make your statements, you make it with the information you have at hand at the time. Six months down the track, or 15 months down the track, circumstances are vastly different and so your decisions have to be very different. And that is as it goes with the Customs Amendment Bill. It all comes down to making sure that we live within our means. It all comes down to making sure that we do the right thing by the economy. We can do what we want if we do that, if we get in touch with our base and build our base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember reading just recently the valedictory speech of the great Labor finance minister Peter Walsh. He left the Senate in 1993. He bemoaned the fact that he did not think we would ever pay back the debt Labor had run up at that time. He did not think we would ever pay it back. The quote I love is where he said that the first thing you lose is your economic sovereignty, and then you lose your political sovereignty. As in business, you end up with administrators and liquidators moving in. As a country, you end up having to make decisions that no one is happy about. I support the bill and I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 makes a number of small amendments to the Customs Act. The amendments are mostly technical—they are not controversial. They aim to improve and strengthen the act that outlines our customs framework. Minister Morrison has proven to be one of the most effective ministers in the Abbott government. He certainly has been one of the most effective immigration and border protection ministers that this country has ever seen. It is through his strong leadership and dedication that the Abbott government has been able to stop the flow of illegal maritime arrivals into Australia. As promised before the last election, we have all but stopped the boats. We are now working on the massive backlog of asylum seekers that the previous Labor government simply stopped processing. It thought that by some magical intervention some solution would appear and fix the mess they had got themselves into. We know what that solution is—it is the Abbott government. Once again we have to fix the mess that the Labor Party left us. We are about getting Australia back on track and providing some certainty especially to those people who were seeking asylum under Labor. Those people were left with no answers and no idea about when their applications for asylum would be processed. Minister Morrison has also proven to be an excellent advocate for Australian customs issues. He is methodically and logically working through bits of the customs legislation and ironing out some of the creases, once again to get things back on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Solomon covers the cities of Darwin and Palmerston, and we are quite often the front line for on-water Customs operations as well as Customs operations through the Darwin International Airport. Mr Morrison recognises that there is some important work carried out in the Top End and that is why he has visited many times, both before the election and certainly after the election. He has met personally with Customs and Border Protection personnel, and he always seeks their feedback on what is working and what is not working. Minister Morrison recognises that they are the subject matter experts—they are on the front line, they have a wealth of knowledge and they know what is needed to protect our borders from particularly unwanted goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains various amendments to the Customs Act. More broadly, those changes are about improving the administration of the appointment of authorised officers. The allowance of class-based authorisations will include future offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The bill is about extending Customs controls to those places where ships and aircraft arrive in Australia that are not proclaimed ports or airports and where agencies do not necessarily have a strong presence. It is about providing greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. It is also about improving application processes for several permissions under the act. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. The bill is also about extending Customs powers in relation to the examination of baggage for domestic passengers on international flights and voyages and of domestic cargo that is carried on international flights and voyages, even though these travels may not be on an international leg. The bill also corrects a technical error, resulting in the enhancement of the interaction of the Infringement Notice Scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports. These amendments aim to improve the practicalities of protecting our borders from unauthorised entries and undesirable goods entering Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate, covering the areas of Darwin and Palmerston, faces a number of different customs threats. For example, every fishing season there are scores of illegal fishing vessels intercepted off the Top End. Illegal fishing poses a real threat to Australian fish stocks and the Australian economy. The waters off Darwin are a pristine marine environment that we regulate to avoid overfishing and pollution causing damage to our marine life. Illegal fishing activity directly undermines the Australian government's hard work and integrity measures put in place to ensure that we fish sustainably and harvest seafood in a way that enables future generations to access the wonderful range of foods we are so fortunate to have in our oceans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Customs and Border Protection are committed to protecting Australian borders on the high seas and are particularly effective in intercepting illegal entries, considering our unfathomably large borders. Just yesterday Border Protection Command and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority intercepted two foreign fishing vessels just 170 nautical miles off Darwin The vessels had on board 14 crew, 45 kilograms of dried fish, 10 kilograms of fresh fish, six live fish and some fishing and diving equipment, all of which, thankfully, has been seized. They were intercepted by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service vessel <span style="font-style:italic;">Dame Roma Mitchell</span>. The two boats have been apprehended on suspicion of illegal fishing activity in Australian waters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In May this year HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Glenelg</span> intercepted a foreign fishing vessel off the coast of Darwin. This boat was also suspected of illegal fishing activity in the Australian Fishing Zone. Border Protection Command personnel found almost 50 kilos of Spanish mackerel, 20 kilos of tuna, 20 kilos of dolphinfish and 10 kilos of barracuda on this vessel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Illegal fishing poses a threat to my electorate, because one in three households in my electorate has a boat. We have a lot of keen fishermen in my electorate. But it is not only the recreational fishers that are impacted by illegal fishing; it is also the small businesses. Many local businesses rely on the regulation of commercial fishing in our region. These large amounts of seafood being taken illegally from our waters mean more work with fewer positive outcomes for our local businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in April, the Australian Customs vessel <span style="font-style:italic;">Cape S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> George</span> intercepted two foreign fishing vessels, also suspected of illegally fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone, after detection by an Australian Customs and Border Protection Service Dash 8 surveillance aircraft. On Monday, 28 April, Border Protection Command personnel boarded these vessels approximately 167 nautical miles north-north-west of Darwin. The vessels had around 190 kilograms of wet trepang—that is a lot of sea cucumber. They also had some diving equipment on this boat. Customs personnel also saw people on a second boat throwing items overboard, and they were also found to have various fishing equipment and bags of salt, all indicating that there was illegal fishing activity occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in April, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Launceston</span> intercepted a foreign fishing vessel approximately 180 nautical miles north-west of Darwin, which was also suspected of illegally fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone. It was found to have approximately 20 kilos of salted trepang, five reef fish and five kilos of dried fish, along with hookah and some diving gear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in April, a foreign fishing vessel was detected approximately 275 nautical miles west of Darwin by, once again, an Australian Customs Dash 8 surveillance aircraft and was intercepted by the Australian Customs vessel <span style="font-style:italic;">Botany Bay</span>. The vessel had fishing lines deployed and over 500 kilograms of fish on board. That is just outrageous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year, four foreign fishing vessels with a total of 58 crew were apprehended approximately 180 nautical miles north-west of Darwin. The wooden vessels were intercepted on Wednesday, 12 March and Thursday, 13 March by HMAS ships <span style="font-style:italic;">Launceston</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Glenelg</span>. Over 60 giant clams were found on board the vessels, as well as large quantities in their holds. Personnel also found a large quantity of sea cucumber and another large number of assorted fish. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to put on record the outstanding work that our Customs and Border Protection people do. I think the examples I have just given highlight the success that they have been able to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another pressing issue in my electorate is the running of drugs in and out of our international airport and also our domestic airfields to remote communities around the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Police do an amazing job of monitoring this dangerous trade. The knowledge and expertise of our Australian Customs is invaluable in sharing information and skills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As drug runners use more creative ways to evade authorities, Customs must be appropriately equipped to deal with these constantly changing tactics. The coalition is ensuring that Customs and Border Protection agencies are well funded and properly resourced, so they can continue to protect not only my constituents but also the rest of the Australian communities from drugs, crime and disadvantage associated with drug use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Customs officers working in my electorate in monitoring or looking after Darwin International Airport do an incredible job combating drug trafficking. The Top End is often referred to as Australia's gateway to Asia. This is because there are eight capital cities and 69 international airports within a four-hour flight north of Darwin. This means Customs officers have a huge responsibility in protecting Australia's borders at Darwin International Airport. We have many international flights in and out of Darwin. We need to do all we can to support these hard workers, who are often the front line of defence from external threats coming through our airports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is obvious that customs officers in my electorate are doing a fantastic job by the large drug busts that they have made this year alone, which I will relay to you. An investigation beginning in July resulted in one arrest and the seizure of 1.6 kilos of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine in Darwin last month. Thank God those drugs are no longer available in the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint agency operation targeting air cargo began when Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officers in Darwin identified multiple consignments of suspicious packaging originating from Bangkok. In September Customs personnel apprehended a 42-year-old UK national and a 56-year-old Australian national, who have now appeared in Darwin court charged with the attempted smuggling of two kilos of ephedrine into Australia. In July, a Victorian man arrived on a flight from Malaysia and he was found to have a laser pointer, a knuckle duster, 30 electric shock devices disguised as torches, a spring-loaded knife, 700 steroid tablets and 1,400 tablets containing Viagra. Thankfully they are also not available in our community anymore. You can tell that the operation does fantastic work in my electorate. As the member for Solomon, I recognise the important role Customs officers play and I am united with the minister in wanting to ensure our Customs and Border Protection agencies are properly resourced. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  The member for Solomon, in her contribution today, demonstrated very clearly why the Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is important and also the challenges being faced by this wonderful island nation, with its extensive coastline. I also want to commend her for her complimentary remarks in relation to the Australian Customs and Border Protection officers and their work. From Darwin and into your area they do an amazing job—and I did meet some of them when I was there previously. They have a huge task, and clearly they are very effective. And they have someone strong to represent their issues here in the parliament, so well done, Member for Solomon. There are many challenges, as we heard from the member for Solomon, with illegal fishing and drugs. When I was listening to the member for Solomon, one of the issues that hit me, as a farmer, was how difficult it is to protect our biosecurity in this country, with so much coastline and so many people, for different reasons, wanting to land here in Australia. With wooden-hulled boats come a whole lot of risks and challenges, so the work done by our Customs and Border Protection officers is certainly significant.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures within this bill are technical amendments to the Customs Act 1901, and they will assist our Customs officers in the job that they do. These amendments will allow class based authorisations to include future offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given; extend Customs control to those places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act; provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. These are just practical measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also improve the application processes for several permissions under the act. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. That is of course a time-saving, very practical way of managing this. The bill will also extend Customs powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages, and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage, and enhance the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety and security of the Australian people and those who are visiting our country are a priority for this government. We have heard repeatedly about some of the measures we have taken in our strong response to a range of threats, be it ISIL or other terrorist threats in Australia or overseas. We have seen close corporation to combat transnational crime with international allies and neighbouring countries. We have seen an investment of $630 million in Australian security and law enforcement agencies for counterterrorism measures. We as a government take these responsibilities seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the member for Cook, is sitting in the chamber. I commend him for his outstanding effort in his quest to control Australia's border and his commitment to stopping the boats. I think everybody, no matter where they are in the world, has a very clear message about the minister's intent and his commitment to this task. This bill furthers his efforts to make sure that Australians are secure and safe in every way that the Australian government can contribute to that. The Australian has made a contribution of $400,000 to support INTERPOL's foreign fighters initiatives, over and above our ongoing annual membership contributions. The global and interconnected world that we live in basically also creates a borderless ongoing criminal threat. I see that the minister is constantly aware and working on the constantly changing threat that we in this nation face as a result of the fact that we are in a global environment and one of transnational crime. Customs and justice are a key part of that. This government takes very seriously both of those roles. We have seen that through the member for Cook and his very dedicated approach to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also invested $20 million to boost AUSTRAC's ability to stop cash being funnelled to terrorists and to crack down on money laundering by organised crime that funds the trade in drugs such as crystal meth and others. We heard from the member for Solomon some of the extraordinary amounts in value and weight of drugs that the Customs service is intercepting not just here but around the world. I notice that the AFP intercepted 81 credit card knives, as they are called, at airports around Australia. I hope some of the measures contained in this bill will assist with this. The knives were detected through airport screening. They are dangerous weapons. They are illegal and are banned from being taken on domestic and international flights. Of course, buying these knives is illegal, but I note through the work that I do in the online space that most of these are bought online. All jurisdictions have offences relating to the sale of a knife that is manufactured to disguise or conceal the blade or to give the impression that it is an innocuous item such as a plastic card of similar dimensions to a credit card. I am very pleased that the government has sourced and resourced additional Australian Federal Police offices at our airports. We also have an AFP counterterrorism officer in Turkey cooperating on global issues and concerns about terrorism and transnational crime. The AFP's international network includes 99 positions across 29 partner countries overseas as well as in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent passage of the crimes legislation dealing with psychoactive substances is also part of our very direct focus on all forms of the safety and security of Australians. We have a very clear duty to protect the safety and security of Australian citizens here and wherever else we can. That has been a commitment by the minister. I think all of us took and are taking very seriously the issues surrounding the disappearance of MH370. They are very real in Western Australia, from where the recovery effort is being managed out of RAAF Base Pearce and other parts of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are aware that terrorists are constantly changing what they do and how they do it. They are increasingly sophisticated. They are constantly evolving what they do and how they do it. Our customs and border protection agencies need to be able to constantly change what they to, to adapt what they do. We need to give them the tools through these sorts of technical amendments to be able to do the job that we employ them to do. They take very seriously the job we give them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to biosecurity, we have seen so much wonderful news about three very valuable free trade agreements—those with Japan, Korea and China—and we are working on another free trade agreement, with India, in the year ahead. We will see a lot of produce and goods in and out of Australia as a result of these agreements. Yes, Australia is open for business. That is very clearly demonstrated by this government. There will be increasing demands on Customs because of the trade of goods. The amendments in this bill will assist Customs in the job they have to do in this space. I have no doubt that these measures will assist the officers in the job that they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, once again, I have great respect for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I commend him on the outstanding job that he has done on border protection. I know that this is probably not the last piece of legislation that he will bring before the House. His vigilance in his role is greatly appreciated not just by me as the member for Forrest. It is one of the matters that I receive a lot of feedback on in my electorate. It is good to know that we have such strong representation and an absolute commitment to the safety and security of Australia and its borders.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E3L" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  I want to thank members for their contributions to this debate, particularly the government members, who have been the major contributors to this debate. I want to thank the member for Forrest and my many other colleagues for their strong encouragement of the work that the government is doing not just in the area of customs but more broadly on the issues of border protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note that the opposition indicated their support for this bill in their response earlier today. This is a fairly significant moment. It is fairly common for the opposition to oppose us on border protection measures. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition must have been on autopilot because he did not even know he had voted against a bill here in this very place when the question was put to him about it today when he was speaking at the National Press Club. It is an oddity for the opposition to support this government on stronger border protection but, at least in this case, for what are fairly routine but nonetheless very important matters that are presented in this bill we welcome their support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of a much broader package of measures and initiatives that the government is bringing in on border protection, not just Operation Sovereign Borders and what is being done there to stop the boats so successfully and save lives as a result, to restore integrity to our immigration program and give Australians all over the country confidence in our immigration program. To see that confidence restored in the way our borders are being managed and the way our immigration program is being run in the surveys that have been most recently conducted by Professor Markus and the work of the Scanlon Foundation is very pleasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In border protection in particular we are working towards the start-up of the Australian Border Force on 1 July next year. That measure which will see both this year and over the out years the reinvestment of over $700 million back into our Customs and Border Protection Service and the Border Force reverses the cuts that were made to Customs and Border Protection by the previous government of the same amount over their time in government. So we have replaced what the previous government had removed when it comes to protecting our borders and ensuring not just the work of countering people smuggling but the very important work that is done in passage facilitation and goods facilitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forrest made a very good point—and that is that the tremendous work done by the Minister for Trade and Investment has opened up enormous opportunities for this country. That will see much trade now take place between Australia, Japan and Korea as well, of course, as with China. We look forward to arrangements with India and many more opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of these things is that where those legitimate economic opportunities come, with the movement of both goods and people, the crooks use the same planes, the same internet and the same methods that legitimate traders do. That means that when we expand and open ourselves up, as we should, for greater economic opportunities we also then must redouble our efforts when it comes to ensuring that the crooks, gangs, thugs, people smugglers and traffickers are not able to exploit that increase in economic trade as an opportunity to ply their own nefarious activities and become rich as a result and compromise something that is very dear to this country, and that is the integrity of our borders. It is very much a matter of sovereignty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures have also about bringing to the table quite straightforward, simple changes that will seek to tighten up the legislation even more and close off any loopholes and opportunities that we have identified such that those who might seek to compromise our borders will be frustrated in that purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have reversed those cuts. There was $88 million in addition to what I mentioned before, which was put in immediately upon coming to government. That has significantly increased our screening capacity. In the first quarter of this financial year, we saw a significant increase in the levels of detections as well as increased screening levels, particularly for sea cargo and air cargo. That is welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has also been a $150 million investment in our borders as part of the counter-terrorism package which I know many of the government speakers made reference to in their contributions to this debate. This is an omnibus bill that proposes some minor but important changes to the Customs Act of 1901. These changes will extend Customs control to places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act. They will also provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. The reforms contained in this bill will improve the application processes for approvals to load, unload and use ships' and aircrafts' stores and permissions to transfer goods between certain vessels and applications for certificates of clearance. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these approvals, permissions and certificates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the reforms contained in this bill will extend Customs powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage.  Domestic cargo and domestic travellers and their personal effects are carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages between Australian ports or airports other than proclaimed ports or airports by approved ships or aircraft. Domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the Customs controlled areas of ports or airports and mix with international travellers prior to, during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage. Domestic cargo can currently be loaded and unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg of an international voyage or flight without any authority or permission under the act. The mixing of domestic goods and imported goods or goods for export presents risks for diversion of goods from one stream to the other, especially if goods are of a kind that if imported or exported would be prohibited or subject to border related duties and taxes. The reforms in this legislation will expand the scope of Customs inspection powers to ensure that these vulnerabilities do not persist in the border management environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further enhancements to the act contained in this bill include enhancements to the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports and provisions that permit class based authorisations to include future officers or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The amendments in this bill will enhance Customs controls and examination powers and improve Customs compliance and enforcement activities. These enhancements will modernise the environment within which the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and their successor, the Australian Border Force, operates and help ensure that our border management processes support the best possible systems to facilitate legitimate movement of people and goods and stop those who seek to conduct illicit and illegitimate activity on Australia's borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the members for their contributions to this debate. The work of border protection is in the detail. It is about closing off every opportunity for those who would seek to compromise our borders. The package of measures in this bill is yet another step forward by the government to demonstrate our commitment to stronger borders in all areas. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RIPOLL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  The Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014 amends the Corporations    Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. There are a number of measures, and I will speak to each of them separately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start with the changes to items 1, 2 and 10 of schedule 1 to the bill, which amends the Corporations Act 2001. These changes are designed to better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company with the cost to companies of being required to call and hold a general meeting. It repeals the so-called 100-member rule, which creates an obligation on a corporation to hold a general meeting at the request of 100 or more shareholders. These meetings are often called for protest purposes and create a significant cost to business. The proposed changes do not remove the ability of 100 or more shareholders to add items to scheduled annual general meetings and to instigate debate as an agenda item at these meetings. This retains the right for 100 or more members to raise issues of concern—as exists under the current act—without the often significant cost to shareholders of scheduling extraordinary meetings. This does not affect the right of 100 shareholders to put a resolution to be considered at a general meeting or to distribute a shareholder statement with the notice convening that meeting. The change does not affect the ability of 100 or more shareholders to engage in activism—and this is an important point to note. This is as it should be. Shareholder activism is a component of corporate governance. Shareholders should be able to put issues on the AGM agenda and to instigate a debate at the meeting. This right is of particular importance to retail shareholders, who have limited opportunities to meet with the company prior to the AGM. These rights will not change with the proposed legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 100-member rule can impose significant costs on business—for example, Woolworths was compelled to call an EGM in relation to $1 limits on poker machines. The cost of notifying its shareholders alone was $500,000. The hosting of the meeting meant that Woolworths incurred further costs. The resolution received just 2.5 per cent support. No-one objects to the fact that people might have different views. Shareholders should be able to legitimately raise concerns through a number of mechanisms but not at a significant cost to other shareholders. Similarly, in the two years from late 1999 to late 2001, NRMA was forced to call 12 EGMs to consider resolutions removing directors, each of which incurred several million dollars in costs and resulted in none of the relevant resolutions being passed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is currently alone in providing for a shareholder test that applies regardless of how much capital the requisitionists hold. It is more common that requisitionists must hold at least five to 10 per cent of the shares before they can call a general meeting. Again, no-one disputes the fact that shareholders have a right to question directors and decisions made by a company, but it should not be at a cost to other shareholders. Labor supports this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Items 3 to 5 and 10 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the Corporations Act to improve and streamline remuneration reporting requirements. Currently, disclosing entities that are companies must disclose, for each member of the key management personnel, the value of options that lapse during a financial year. Disclosing entities that are companies must also disclose, for each member of the key management personnel, the percentage value of the remuneration that consists of options. This bill makes changes so that listed disclosing entities that are companies must disclose, for each member of the key management personnel, only the number of options that lapse during a financial year and the financial year in which those options were granted. There will no longer be an obligation to disclose the value of options that lapse or the percentage value of remuneration that consists of options for each member of the key management personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, all disclosing entities that are companies are also required to prepare a remuneration report, regardless of whether they are listed or unlisted. This bill changes that so that unlisted disclosing entities that are companies are no longer required to prepare a remuneration report. Listed disclosing entities continue to be required to prepare a remuneration report. Labor has a proud record of reforming executive remuneration by introducing the two-strikes test that allows shareholders concerned with executive remuneration to vote to spill the board under certain circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia. There have been concerns raised by shareholders and users of remuneration reports that currently the reports contained some information that was of limited benefit or can be found at other places in the annual report. Labor also supports removing the unnecessary requirement for unlisted disclosing entities that are companies to prepare a remuneration report. Unlike listed entities, they are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders through a non-binding resolution and are not subject to the two-strikes test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Item 6 of schedule 1 to this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months. There is confusion about the conditions under which directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months. Currently, section 323D sets out how companies, registered schemes and disclosing entities may determine the length of their financial year. While an entity's financial year is expected to be approximately 12 months long, entities can determine otherwise in cases where: an entity needs to modify its financial year by up to seven days to accommodate week-based internal reporting frameworks or an entity needs to synchronise its financial year in order to prepare consolidated financial reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, subsection 323D(2A) allows entities to determine that their financial year is less than 12 months if none of their previous five financial years have been less than 12 months, the shorter financial year commences at the end of the previous financial year and the decision is in the best interests of the entity. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the interaction between this provision and the operation of subsection 323D(2), which requires that a financial year is 12 months long, unless determined by the directors to be a period that is longer or shorter than 12 months by up to seven days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is confusion surrounding whether taking advantage of the flexibility in section 323D(2) would trigger the five-year period in which an entity is precluded from accessing the benefits offered by section 323D(2A). Similarly, subsection 323D(3) requires an entity to synchronise its financial year end with its parent entity when it becomes a controlled entity. Again, stakeholders have raised concerns that this provision may trigger the five-year period in which an entity is precluded from accessing the benefits offered by section 323D(2A).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to clarify that directors may determine that a financial year is shorter than 12 months by more than seven days irrespective of whether during an entity's previous five financial years the directors have determined that the financial year is shorter than 12 months by up to seven days or determined to synchronise the financial year to prepare consolidated financial statements. Labor supports the measures in this bill that clarify the circumstances and conditions under which directors can alter and determine the financial year is shorter than 12 months by more than 7 days. This removes the unintended confusion arising from changes in 2010 that were intended to make it easier for directors to alter financial-year end dates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Items 7 to 9 of schedule 1 to this bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor. Currently, all public companies, including companies limited by guarantee, are required to appoint and retain an auditor. This bill changes this so that small companies limited by guarantee and those companies limited by guarantee that have their financial reports reviewed are not required to appoint or retain an auditor. This means that companies that are not required to undertake an audit are no longer required to appoint and retain an auditor. All other public companies are required to appoint and retain an auditor, as is current practice. Labor supports these changes that remove unnecessary costs on business by supporting the requirement for companies to appoint and retain an auditor, even if they are not required to conduct an audit. This change is expected to provide the greatest benefit to not-for-profit community organisations, allowing them to better service the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1, items 1 and 2 of schedule 2 to this bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to improve the operation of the takeovers panel by allowing takeover matters to be dealt with more efficiently. Currently, the president and members of the takeovers panel may only participate in proceedings if they are within Australia. These changes mean the president of the takeovers panel may give a direction in respect of members who are to constitute the panel whether or not the president is in Australia. Further, members of the takeovers panel may participate in proceedings whether or not the members are in Australia. As technology improves and the world becomes ever more connected, it is sensible to alter legislation to reflect that change. This bill will allow members of the takeovers panel to participate in proceedings if they are physically located outside of Australia at the time. Labor supports this sensible change to allow the more efficient resolution of disputes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1, items 3 to 8 and part 2, item 9 of schedule 2 to this bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to extend the remuneration tribunal's remuneration setting responsibility to include certain Corporations Act bodies. Currently, the ASIC Act provides that the responsible Treasury portfolio minister determines the terms and conditions—including remuneration—of the chairs and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the FRC; the chair of the Australian Accounting Standards Board, the AASB; and the chair of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the AUASB. The ASIC Act also provides that the FRC is responsible for determining the terms and conditions, including remuneration, of the offices held by the members of the AASB and the AUASB.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and member positions of the FRC, the AASB and the AUASB within the remuneration tribunal's jurisdiction. The remuneration tribunal has specialist skills in reviewing and determining remuneration and is therefore better placed to determine the remuneration of these offices. Moreover, it will ensure consistency in the remuneration setting arrangements between the three bodies and other statutory office holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the responsible Treasury portfolio minister determines the terms and conditions—including remuneration—of the chairs and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the chair of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the chair of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The ASIC Act also provides that the FRC is responsible for determining the terms and conditions and the offices held by the members of the AASB and the AUASB.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the provisions in this bill that brings responsibility for determining the remuneration and full-time-member recreation leave entitlements of the chair and members within the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction. There is no question that that is the best place for them and where they ought to be. The changes that are contained in this bill are supported by Labor. They were changes that Labor was progressing through and matters that had been worked on with bipartisan support across both sides of this chamber, and within the industry and the sector itself. It is good, sensible policy. I offer Labor's support for these measures. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="247130" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAUNDY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I acknowledge the bipartisan nature of the member for Oxley's comments. On the night of 7 September last year, the Prime Minister famously said that Australia, once again, was open for business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He has made no secret since that day that deregulating the nature of government is key. How did he do that? He appointed his Parliamentary Secretary, the honourable member for Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg, and put him in charge of driving this agenda. Not long after that, Josh made contact with me and asked me to give him a hand. I acknowledge today that I have this honour. I acknowledge the member for Bass and the member for Pearce who he did the same for. I had the honour of listening to stories from right around New South Wales, as I know the member for Bass did in Tasmania and the member for Pearce did in Western Australia. Josh picked different people in different states to be the front men, if you like, and to come back to him with all sorts of ways that we can drive this agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time, we are two omnibus repeal days down—$2.1 billion of red tape in the first year, when the aim was $1 billion. I acknowledge the hard work and advocacy of my fellow members of parliament, and especially the member for Kooyong, for doing such a great job. I acknowledge the Prime Minister and the smarts of the PM to put this in his own portfolio, given that Josh's role crosses ministerial boundaries. It was a sensible thing to do and a logical place to put it. When your mantra is, rule 1, that we need to be open for business, it is the right way to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we need to be open for business? We need to be open for because, with MYEFO fast approaching and commodity prices and terms of trade at levels now far lower than they were on 7 September, there is no doubt that the engine room of this economy is the small and medium business sector—a sector which, sadly, has been lacking acknowledgement by government for a long time. I have had the honour of standing in this place many times but on few such occasions have I not advocating on their behalf. Why do I do that? I do that because I come from that sector. It employs 70 per cent of the people in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last six years under a Labor government, in that small business sector alone we lost 519,000 employees. That is not good enough. We need to do better. The best way to do that is by understanding that government is a partner in business, not just a regulator. That has been the key to what the Prime Minister said that night and what the member for Kooyong has taken since that day and rolled forward into a number of pieces of legislation. Tonight, is quite clearly a continuation of that, and so I will speak about the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures Bill 2014).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a summary, the government has introduced a package of reforms to the corporations law that reduces the regulatory burden imposed on Australian businesses to improve their productivity and competitiveness. The reform package that we are talking about today saves compliance costs of around $14 million a year. The bill also contains measures to improve the efficiency of government processes, reflecting the government's commitments to seeking opportunities to improve efficiencies in all spheres. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures contained in this bill will, in no certain order, better balance the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company and the costs to companies of being required to call and hold a general meetings; improve and reduce remuneration reporting requirements; clarify the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months; exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor; and improve the operation of the Takeovers Panel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I will turn to the abolition of the 100-member rule. I acknowledge that the member for Oxley went into this in some detail. We are removing the requirement for directors of a company to hold a general meeting on the request of 100 shareholders—hence the name. This seeks to strike a better balance between the interests of minority shareholders and shareholders as a whole. In large corporations the 100-member rule allows groups holding less than one per cent of voting shares to force a company to incur the significant costs of holding a general meeting. There are significant historical examples of this. In 2012, the 100-member rule was used by GetUp! to force Woolworths into an annual general meeting which cost that company and ultimately shareholders $2 million. Ultimately it cost government their taxation revenue from what would have been an increased bottom line had this $2 million not been spent. It is a flow-on effect. That is why this is sensible policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst saying this, small shareholders will continue to be able to have their voices heard, but in a way that does not impose an unreasonable cost on the company or other shareholders. One hundred shareholders will continue to be able to put a resolution on the agenda of a general meeting and circulate a statement to other shareholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, shareholders with at least five per cent of the votes that may be cast at a general meeting will continue to be able to require that directors hold a general meeting. This measure is supported by industry stakeholders such as the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Governance Institute of Australia and the Business Council of Australia as well as shareholder groups such as the Australian Shareholders Association. This measure alone is estimated to save business around $1.5 million a year in compliance costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, with regard to remuneration reporting, the government is improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia by ensuring that the information provided is useful for shareholders and investors. This measure removes the requirement for unlisted disclosing entities to prepare a remuneration report. This measure alone is estimated to save unlisted disclosing entities around $8.5 million in compliance costs. The remuneration report is simply not relevant for unlisted disclosing entities—for example, unlisted companies, unlisted debenture issuers such as Banksia, and unlisted managed investment schemes. Unlike listed entities, they are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders through a non-binding resolution and are not subject to the 'two-strikes' test. Australia's 'two strikes' rule allows shareholders to vote to 'spill' the board if the remuneration report receives a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more, two years in a row. This measure also improves the usefulness of information on options granted to key management personnel. It has been informed by feedback from users of remuneration reports. Rather than reporting the value of lapsed options, this will be replaced with a requirement to disclose the number of lapsed options and the year in which the lapsed options were granted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, with regard to changing financial year end dates, the government is clarifying when entities—companies, registered schemes and disclosing entities—can change their year end dates. Put simply, this measure will put beyond doubt the conditions under which directors can determine that a financial year is to be shorter than 12 months by more than seven days. The bill clarifies but does not change the legal operation of the existing law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, with regard to auditor appointment requirements, this government is removing the nonsensical requirement for certain companies limited by guarantee that are not required to undertake an audit to appoint an auditor. Currently, all public companies are required to appoint an auditor even if they are not required to conduct a full audit of their financial reports. This unnecessary burden imposes a $4 million compliance cost on business per year. This change is expected to predominately benefit companies that have a not-for-profit focus—for example, sports and recreation related organisations, community service organisations, education-related institutions and religious organisations. It is a win, I am sure, for every member of parliament but definitely in Reid, where there is a prevalence of all those listed organisations. This measure will ensure that these organisations can focus on providing services for the community, rather than wasting money and time on needless red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifthly, with regard to extending the remuneration tribunal jurisdiction, this measure gives the Remuneration Tribunal the authority to set the remuneration of the chair and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The Remuneration Tribunal is an independent body that has specialist skills in reviewing and determining remuneration. This measure will bring the setting of remuneration of those office holders into line with the remuneration setting of public offices more broadly and improve the efficiency of government processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, with regard to improving the efficiency of the Takeovers Panel, this measure will allow Takeovers Panel members to perform functions while overseas. It seems like common sense, but that ability has not been provided before. This removes an outdated procedure and reflects the reality that the vast majority of panel members are engaged in employment separate to their Takeovers Panel commitments, which can include a significant amount of overseas travel. This will likely have a positive impact on business through the more efficient resolution of applications being considered by the Takeovers Panel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak in support of this bill. I keep going back to the words mentioned on the night of 7 September by the Prime Minister in his first address after winning the election: 'Australia is open for business.' If you look at the $14 million that this bill saves, in reality a third to 49 per cent of that is ours, depending on the structure of the company involved. At a time when the revenue side of our budget is under extreme stress, through no fault of our own, through world trading situations, we need to do things like this and keep this agenda real and live, because the sooner we can get out of the expense side of the profit and loss statement of every business in this country, irrespective of size, the more that profit will flow to the bottom line, the bigger our share will be and the more that we as a government will able to reinvest in such vital services that our communities and our electorates need. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="137174" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NIKOLIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I am very pleased to make a contribution to the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014, which once again highlights this government's commitment to get rid of unnecessary legislation and regulation and, in so doing, increase Australia's productive capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Tasmania's representative on the coalition's deregulation committee, as the member for Reid mentioned, there is certainly a spring in my step every time I make my way to the member for Kooyong's s office to sit down with my colleagues—the member for Reid here, the member for Pearce, the member for Deakin, the member for Ryan and the member for Hindmarsh—and talk about real world issues. If there is one thing that has occupied the thinking of people in my community during my period as a full-time candidate for 2½ years, it is to try and take away the binding coils of regulation that impinge on their ability to run their businesses. So to now be in a position with my colleagues, having brought something to the table, to see it appear during a repeal day and then to be able to report to my community 'Here is something that we have done to make a meaningful difference in your business' is satisfying indeed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a spring in my step when I go to the member for Kooyong's office not just because he is great company but because, as I said, we are seeing reward for effort. There is some degree of regulation that is no doubt both necessary and desirable in establishing efficient markets, but excessive red tape, as we saw during the six years of Labor and then the Labor-Greens governments, detracts from productivity and, ultimately, has a close correlation to lower living standards. So what we do here has a meaningful impact on people's lives. I know in my community and around the rest of the country, as I have gone to various places for committee meetings and so on, industries, peak bodies and stakeholders across the country have welcomed our deregulation efforts. What it demonstrates not just in this area of public policy but in so many other areas of public policy is that this government has the resolve to make the changes that have that meaningful impact on people's lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Reid talked about our aspiration to achieve $1 billion in cuts every year when it comes to our deregulation efforts. Indeed, in our last repeal day in October, we removed nearly 1,000 pieces and more than 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation. That built on our last repeal day of last March, where the government removed more than 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation—on that occasion cutting more than $700 million in compliance costs. The combined effects of our two repeal days in 2014 is a doubling of our commitment. As the member for Reid said, $2.1 billion cut in compliance costs—making that a meaningful difference in the lives of businesses around the country. That is 400 new measures to cut red tape across all agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to red tape, the coalition government is getting on with doing what we said we would do. In the future that means the continued designation of two parliamentary sitting days each year as repeal days to continue this work. We are going to incrementally build on this until we have stripped away those binding coils of regulation and legislation. What the coalition's approach will do, if we truly believe in effects based policy making, will result in more efficient government and more productive business and not-for-profit sectors. That means higher competitiveness, support for new jobs and the lowering of household and business costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened very carefully to the member for Oxley and his very good remarks and his support for this bill. I only wish that that the member for Oxley in the 43rd Parliament had had more influence, because, in contrast to what we have achieved in just 14 months, in six years under Labor we saw the imposition of another 21,000 pieces of regulation. I used to be a senior public servant and formerly a senior Army officer, but I remember sitting there looking at cabinet submissions in early 2008 and I think the Rudd government got off on the right foot. What they were saying about the deregulatory impacts in cabinet submissions was absolutely right. Mr Rudd had a one-on, one-off promise. Indeed, as we wrote our cabinet submissions in the department, there were regulatory impact statements, but the problem was—like so many policy developments of the former government—there was a long distance between aspiration and delivery. That is why that undertaking never really saw its way through the next six years and that is why we ended up with 21,000 additional regulations. It was, to put it mildly, a forgettable period in our political history, because the government's solution was always more intervention—a little bit more Kevin would solve pretty much every problem!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is where the layers of regulation we have today originate from. You might remember that old Sara Lee approach—the layer upon layer commercial. That is exactly what happened when it came to regulation—layer upon layer of regulation that hurt productivity, deterred investment and innovation and cost jobs. Those opposite may not believe me, but perhaps they should listen to the Productivity Commission, which has looked at this matter closely. They have estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP, unless we act to remove the unnecessary regulation that binds our multifactor productivity. So I congratulate the member for Kooyong and I congratulate those members of our deregulation committee, who are present here this evening, on the thoughtful and purposeful approach to real change when it comes to red tape. But I do not want to praise the member for Kooyong too much, because it is ultimately the portfolio ministers who have had to put their shoulders to the wheel to look within their departments and find the savings that underpin that $2.1 billion in deregulatory savings that we have found just in the last 14 months—minister after minister cutting six years of stifling red tape from their portfolios.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill we are considering this evening is no different, and I congratulate the Minister for Finance and Assistant Treasurer on this package of reforms to the corporations law that reduces the regulatory burden imposed on Australian business. This one package alone will save $14 million in compliance costs. That does not sound a lot, but a million here and a million there and pretty soon you are talking about serious money. And so $14 million being cut is impressive in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains measures to improve the efficiency of government processes. As to the specific measures contained in the bill, they will achieve some important effects, and some of them have been touched on, but I would like to put some of the more prominent ones on the record. There are six things I would like to talk about: the achievement of a better balance between the rights of shareholders to raise issues with a company and the attendant costs to the company and other shareholders that is required to call and hold a general meeting; the bill improves and reduces remuneration reporting requirements; it clarifies the circumstances in which a financial year may be less than 12 months; it exempts certain companies that are limited by guarantee from the need to appoint or retain an auditor; it improves the operation of the Takeovers Panel; and it extends the Remuneration Tribunal's remuneration-setting responsibility to include certain statutory bodies I will deal with each of these measures in turn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the '100-member rule', the government is removing the requirement for directors of a company to hold a general meeting on the request of 100 shareholders—ergo, the name the '100-member rule'. We believe that that strikes a fairer and better balance between the interests of minority shareholders and the larger shareholder group. In large corporations, the 100-member rule allows groups holding less than what can be one per cent of voting shares to hold a company to ransom by forcing an expensive general meeting. What history tells us—and I am someone who has completed the company director's course—is that resolutions that are proposed by these very small activist groups of shareholders generally receive little support. My colleague, the member for Reid, talked about that infamous case study—the Woolworths case, where they spent nearly $2 million to hold a general meeting at the behest of just over 200 shareholders, or 0.05 per cent of the total shareholders of Woolworths, which has some 417,000 shareholders. When that general meeting was held, the actual resolution that was being proposed by this small activist group of GetUp sponsored shareholders, 97 per cent of the company did not support the resolution. That demonstrates clearly the linkage between the cost versus the benefit of a particular case being put in large companies. I am not for one moment saying that small shareholders should not have their voices heard—they should and will continue to have their voices heard—but in a way that does not impose an unreasonable cost on the company or other shareholders </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred shareholders will continue to be able to put a resolution on the agenda of a general meeting and circulate a statement to other shareholders. In addition, shareholders with at least five per cent of the votes that may be cast at a general meeting can still require that directors hold a general meeting. But it sets that bar high to ensure a more reasonable accommodation between the numbers of shareholders and the costs involved in a company in acceding to their demands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure is supported by both industry stakeholders, such as the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Governance Institute of Australia and the Business Council of Australia, as well as shareholder groups, such as the Australian Shareholders' Association. Again, a million here, a million there—this will save businesses around $1.5 million per annum in compliance costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia by ensuring that the information provided is useful for shareholders and investors. This measure removes the requirement for unlisted disclosing entities to prepare a remuneration report, which will save some $8.5 million in compliance costs. The remuneration report is simply not relevant for unlisted disclosing entities—and the member for Reid listed some of those before—because, unlike listed entities, they are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders through a non-binding resolution and are not subject to the 'two-strikes' test, which allows shareholders to vote to 'spill' the board if the remuneration report receives a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more two years in a row.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill, the government also clarifies when entities—companies, registered schemes and disclosing entities—can change their year-end dates. This measure puts beyond doubt the conditions under which directors can determine that a financial year is to be shorter than 12 months. The bill clarifies but does not change the legal operation of the existing law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, the bill also removes auditor appointment requirements for certain companies limited by guarantee that are not required by law to undertake an audit. It simply fails the common-sense test to impose an audit requirement on a company that is not, by law, required to undertake an audit. This imposes a $4 million compliance cost burden on business, which will be saved—and you can see these savings adding up as I talk through these provisions. It imposes that burden particularly on organisations like not not-for-profits. In my community of Northern Tasmania, for example, this includes sports clubs, community service organisations like my Lions club,  education related institutions and religious organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further measure in the bill is to give the Remuneration Tribunal the authority to set the remuneration of the chair and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the Australian Accounting Standards Board, and the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, bringing the setting of remuneration of those office holders into line with the remuneration-setting of public officers more broadly and improving the efficiency of government processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further measure will improve the efficiency of the Takeovers Panel by allowing members to perform panel functions while overseas. This removes an outdated procedure and reflects the reality that the vast majority of panel members are engaged in employment separate to their Takeovers Panel commitments—which can include a significant amount of overseas travel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill is yet more evidence of this government's resolve and purposeful implementation of our vital deregulation agenda. That there is so much red tape in our community that even well-meaning volunteers are dedicating too much of their precious time and effort to navigate their way through a maze of government rules shows us just how bad the situation has become. This bill is but one contribution to this government's bonfire of bureaucracy—but an important step nevertheless on the long road to sensible economic reform.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  The Abbott government is determined to continue their commitment to making the business of doing business easier and making the mechanics of governing more transparent. The changes proposed in the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014 Bill once again demonstrate the lack of care taken by the Labor-Greens alliance while they were in charge. The member for Oxley said on Radio 612 ABC that the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments had repealed thousands of regulations while they were in office. So it is difficult to understand how the coalition government is still able to find so many amendments that will have such great impact and relief on the compliance load of business in this country. So what exactly did Labor manage to rectify? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first amendment in this bill redresses the current imbalance that exists when just 100 shareholders without a minimum number of shares can force the board of directors of a major corporation with thousands of shareholders to pay for a general meeting, costing thousands of dollars, to vote on resolutions that historically garner very little support at these meetings. Ultimately, these types of special meetings only hurt all shareholders, as the expense of calling these meetings impacts on the bottom line and results in a smaller dividend. I understand that small shareholders in some corporations may have issues with the governance of the corporation, but there are yearly meetings where these issues can be addressed. And, if an issue is serious enough, this amendment still allows a general meeting to be called if just five per cent of shareholders call for it. So, in this instance, a disgruntled shareholder can contact other shareholders and garner support for a meeting but at a higher level. This would usually mean the support of just one institutional investor. One hundred shareholders are still able to put resolutions on the agenda of general meetings and circulate materials at the expense of the company. This bill does not seek to strip away the ability of small shareholders to have their concerns heard; it just ensures that it is done in a way that does not harm the corporation financially and inconvenience other shareholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major points of interest to shareholders, business groups and indeed the wider community is the issue of remuneration for directors and executives. The Corporations Act seeks to make this as transparent as possible and that remuneration reporting provides all relevant details to shareholders. The key word in the next amendment is relevant. This amendment removes the necessity for listed entities to detail the value of lapsed share options offered as part of key management remuneration. Options which were taken up must still be reported, but if the option lapsed it has no financial impact on the remuneration of the individual involved. In fact, they may have been slightly worse off if they had paid for the option but failed to conclude the transaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can already hear the objections of those opposite saying we are trying to hide corporate pay from scrutiny, but this is just not true. Options that have been taken up, resulting in a share purchase at an option price, need to be reported as income for the sake of a pay package. If the option has lapsed, it had no financial impact on remuneration. In effect, this is now making it clearer to shareholders which executives and management individuals took the options and ignores those who did not, a much easier system to read.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third amendment streamlines the auditor appointment process for companies limited by guarantee. A company limited by guarantee is usually, but not always, a not-for-profit organisation that has taken the step from an incorporated body. While they will still need to have their financial reports reviewed, there will be no requirement for them to hire and retain an auditor. For such companies that have no operating capital beyond that which the guarantors have put up, this move makes common sense. The cost saving can and will be quite significant for companies that are in the business of helping others. All other companies will be required to appoint and retain an auditor as per the current law. Only a very select subset of guaranteed companies will be exempt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While speaking of streamlining processes, this bill seeks to address an anomaly in the operation of the Takeovers Panel under the ASIC Act. While the members of the panel are appointed from the private sector and hold senior roles in banks, law firms and significant corporations, the application of the ASIC Act is limited to Australia. This can be interpreted to mean that members of the panel have to be physically present in the country in order to carry out their duties. This is plainly absurd. When you have senior members of large corporations it is expected that they travel on occasions to other countries, especially with the expanding markets the Abbott government is opening up through our pursuit of trade agreements in our region. There is no good reason that a panel member must be situated physically within Australia for them to do their job. Technology has certainly broken down many of the previous barriers to effective communication that existed 13 years ago when this provision was declared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And again, in chapter 6 of this bill we return to the theme of efficiency. The ASIC Act currently gives the Treasurer responsibility for setting the terms and conditions, including remuneration, for the chairman and members of the Financial Reporting Council, or FRC, the chairman of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the chairman of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, with the FRC having input into the terms and conditions of AASB and AUASB. Rather than this approach, the government feels it is much better if the already established remuneration commission takes over the role of establishing the terms, conditions and remuneration of these entities. This establishes a level of transparency not seen before and lays to rest any argument that these are 'jobs for the boys'. By keeping these decisions at arm's length there can be no claims of impropriety or favouritism. And the process is far more transparent than the previous arrangements. Decisions will be made available and not hidden behind the veil of cabinet confidentiality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last point I wish to speak on is the clarification of the financial year for corporations. This may seem a bit curious—as we all know, the financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June. However, this clarification allows corporations the flexibility to shorten or lengthen the financial year by seven days in order for the close of the financial year to fall in line with corporation computer runs. It can be very costly to run reports out of sequence for business. Staff need to be paid extra, computer programs need to be altered and the potential for errors is high. By clarifying that they are able to do this, the government is supporting business by saying: 'We can respond to your needs. You can continue as you are, and we can work around your operation in this instance'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is yet another example of the commitment the coalition government has to cleaning up the mess left by the Labor-Greens alliance. Yes, they left the budget in a shambles and locked future governments into reckless spending past their term. But that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the reckless indifference they paid to actually governing. If they had spent as much time attempting to govern as they did on the machinations of who would be the next puppet Prime Minister, then we would not have to keep introducing amendment and repeal bills to the House</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, yes, there is more to come, because Australia needs an industrious government. Following the indolence of the Rudd and Gillard eras, we need to create stronger economic growth, which in turn means profitable businesses and in turn jobs for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I commend the member for Ryan on many of the points she made in her speech, including the pertinent fact that if Labor had done such a great job with reducing red tape then why have we spent a year going through so many different areas of operations of businesses and organisations to reduce red tape and get some real outcomes? The member for Pearce acknowledged that point as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the subject of how that the coalition has approached this, right from the top down the Prime Minister has been extremely focused, from day one, on getting results in this area. He has the Parliamentary Secretary Josh Frydenberg, and a team of other members, including a number here in the House today. I see the fine member for Deakin. He has covered Victoria. So from a Victorian perspective if there are any types of industry associations or businesses that have had particular issues with red tape and compliance, he has been onto their case. In South Australia, I have talked with many groups, such as the South Australian Freight Council, the resources and energy council, Business SA, the Australian Industry Group and financial services. I have consulted with them, asked them what the challenges are, come back with suggestions, and provided input. We have gone out and tried to amend what we can. We heard the member for Bass earlier. I am sure he did the same thing in Tasmania. The member for Reid spoke earlier and covered New South Wales. It has been very much a team effort, a holistic approach, and I commend my colleagues on the good work they have done around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the member for Kingston is sitting in the House today, and I am sure if there was a matter that come up in her domain or area of interest she would say, 'Yes, can you help? We have had a go. We might not have got as far as we needed, but you are kicking some goals, coalition. You are getting rid of red tape—$2 billion—and maybe you can help on this occasion given that perhaps we did not go as far as we meant to. We made a start but the job is being finished in fine form.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the South Australian Labor government has had a crack at this too, on many occasions. Just recently they got together with accounting firms including KPMG and a local bank, BankSA, and CEDA, and they all came out with a whole lot of points. To their credit, they identified reducing red tape and compliance as an area they must address better than they have in the past. Well done for jumping on the train—but you need to deliver. You cannot just talk about it; you have to get results. That is what we have done in many areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a few points about corporations legislation—these points have been addressed in great detail by my colleagues so I will not go into them in great detail, but I will run through some of the more important aspects of the bill. It is estimated that the reform package in this bill in particular will reduce business compliance costs by around $14 million per year. We are chipping away at so many different areas. Maybe it is not one big headline that might capture the attention of the news of the day, but it is important for the organisations and businesses out there. We are improving the efficiency of government processes. The first one I will talk about is the abolition of the 100-member rule. The government is removing the requirement for directors of a company to hold a general meeting at the request of 100 shareholders. We heard of examples where corporations have been required to spend millions of dollars holding annual general meetings at the behest of a small group of shareholders. We are not saying we should remove the ability of shareholders to propose resolutions or make their case, or have their voices heard. It is important to note that small shareholders will continue to be able to have their voices heard, but in a way that does not impose an unreasonable cost, an unreasonable burden, on the company and other shareholders. Importantly, this measure is supported by industry stakeholders, whether it be the AICD, the Governance Institute, the Business Council or, significantly, the Australian Shareholders' Association.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important element of the bill we are addressing is remuneration reporting. The government is improving the disclosure of executive remuneration information in Australia by ensuring that the information provided is useful for shareholders and investors. I want to touch on auditor appointment requirements because of their relevance to not-for-profits. We have to ensure that not-for-profits have as few regulations and compliance obligations as necessary, because they have limited resources. As we often hear, they run very effectively on the smell of an oily rag and they have the great objective of serving the community. This element will assist them by removing the compliance costs burden, to the tune of around $4 million, for certain companies limited by guarantee that are not required to undertake an audit to appoint or retain an auditor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is another example of us delivering on our commitment to reduce red tape, consulting with industry and getting results but knowing that there is still a job to be done. The government will continue to engage with the community and industry and reduce red tape to make their life easier. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I congratulate the member for Hindmarsh, who has done an outstanding job advocating for the interests of South Australia on our subcommittee which has been on the search for red tape reductions wherever we can find them. It is always important to put legislation into the broader context, and so I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill. Since forming government the coalition has placed a high priority on identifying and repealing the burdensome and redundant regulations that have built up over time. Many former governments are guilty of allowing that to happen, and none are more guilty than the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments of 2007 to 2013. I remind the Labor Party that former PM Rudd committed to a policy of one in, one out when it came to regulations. But these were just empty words. More than 21,000 new regulations were introduced during the Labor Party's six years in government. Businesses and individuals throughout the nation are bound up in red tape. In my own electorate of Deakin, the single biggest issue that small business owners speak to me about is the excruciating process of any interaction with government. That just got worse under the Labor Party. Our deregulatory agenda is changing this—slowly but methodically and surely. We are committed to helping lift up our nation by shedding the regulations that are holding us and our people back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Assisting with this process, as foreshadowed by the member for Hindmarsh, was the coalition's deregulatory task force, very ably led by my friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and member for Kooyong. I did have the privilege of serving on this task force, giving me a unique insight into the varied ways that regulation has been stifling innovation and curbing productivity in our country. My remit was to get out there and find every piece of red tape we could repeal that had a unique Victorian aspect to it. I did that with vigour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government recognises that while some degree of regulation is always necessary, bad regulation and too much regulation hurts productivity, deters innovation and investment and ultimately costs jobs. We have adopted a whole-of-government approach to cutting red tape. We did commit before the election to reducing red tape by $1 billion each year. A dedicated regulation unit tasked with identifying these savings was set up in each major federal department—backing up our words with actions. This year, for the first time in history, we held two repeal days dedicated to repealing thousands of pieces of redundant legislation—and weren't our two repeal days in 2014 an outstanding success. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So even before the Spring Repeal Day last month, the government had more than doubled our target and announced more than 400 measures with a net reduction of $2.1 billion in compliance costs. We have listened to the concerns of our nation, from small businesses to large corporations, from individuals to community groups, all to ensure that we achieve the ultimate goal of repealing red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering practical relief from red tape across all industries and sectors of society, including in the not-for-profit space. We are reducing the government's footprint and getting out of the way. We want to make it easier for businesses and individuals to focus their energies, ultimately, on what it is that adds to their bottom line and creates more jobs for our society. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today, therefore, represents another step in that methodical process that I referred to earlier. The amendments in this bill collectively reduce compliance costs on business by around $14 million a year. The bill contains a range of common-sense measures that not only remove unnecessary regulation but also clarify existing regulatory obligations and enhance the efficiency of government, benefiting all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In discussing these changes in more detail, I want to turn firstly to the amendments to the Corporations Act and, in particular, to a change that is very, very welcome in the business community—the abolition of the 100-member rule. Currently, directors of a company must hold a general meeting—at the company's expense, of course—if requested to do so by 100 shareholders; the 100-member rule. While this rule may have made sense at some companies that are of smaller size, at larger corporations it is likely that 100 shareholders represent a very small percentage of the total shareholders. Frequently, in a large publicly listed company, that could be less than one per cent of the share capital of that company. At the same time, the resolutions proposed by the shareholders who at times call those meetings often receive very little support; but the cost of holding these general meetings is a burden on the company and ultimately reduces shareholders' returns. A great example is that Woolworths was forced to call a general meeting a couple of years ago at the behest of 0.05 per cent of shareholders—or some 210 shareholders out of the total share register of 417,000. That special meeting cost Woolworths nearly $2 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is seeking to strike a better balance between the interests of minority shareholders and the shareholders as a whole. We are removing the ability of 100 shareholders with voting rights to call a general meeting and hence saving the business and shareholders from having to foot the bill for that potentially costly process. But we are not throwing the baby out with the bathwater: we are retaining key rights so that shareholders will still have their voices heard. The five per cent rule will continue so that shareholders with five per cent of voting rights can still call a general meeting, holding directors and the company to account for their decisions. Importantly, the rights of 100 shareholders to put forward resolutions for the agenda of a general meeting or circulate material to other shareholders still remain firmly in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that business will save around $1½ million per annum in compliance costs as well. The government has consulted widely on this measure and other measures contained in this bill. It is important to note that the measure has broad support from industry stakeholders such as the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Governance Institute of Australia and the Business Council of Australia as well as, importantly, shareholder groups such as the Australian Shareholders' Association.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also contains a range of other meaningful amendments to the Corporations Act. Remuneration reporting requirements are improved, saving around $8½ million in compliance costs. The government recognises that unlisted companies should not have to prepare a remuneration report. Quite simply, in those situations a remuneration report is not relevant. Unlike the situation with listed companies, the report does not have to be adopted by shareholders and therefore is not subject to the two-strikes test which can lead to a spill of the board if the report is rejected in those particular circumstances. Once again, we are doing away with paperwork that is superfluous but costly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also clarifies some confusion in the existing law around when entities, including companies, can change their end-of-year date. One measure that particularly pleases me is that the bill removes some nonsensical requirements with respect to auditors. Currently, the law requires certain companies limited by guarantee to appoint an auditor, even though they are not required to undertake an audit. That is a completely bizarre feature of the current law. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we remove this requirement, we will also remove a $4 million compliance cost burden on business. Importantly, this change will predominantly benefit companies with a not-for-profit focus, as I foreshadowed earlier, freeing them up to concentrate on what they do best. If they are not required to conduct an audit, they will not be required to appoint an auditor. Many sports and recreation organisations, community service organisations, education related institutions and religious institutions around the country, including in my electorate of Deakin, have already welcomed this change in advice to me.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me briefly now turn to the amendments to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act, which are contained in schedule 2 of the bill. These amendments seek to improve the efficiency of government, because, just as we endeavour to help business become more efficient and productive by removing red tape, we must also look at government's processes through the same prism. ASIC is no different. </span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  " />We are also improving the efficiency of the operation of the Takeovers Panel. The panel's operations are currently being hindered by the requirement—quite a bizarre requirement—that the panel can only operate if members are physically located in Australia. Obviously, members are appointed from the private sector and hold senior positions in banks, law firms and large corporations. As you can imagine, these people are frequently required to travel overseas for work, preventing them from fulfilling their panel obligations even though modern technology would allow them to do so. <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">With this </span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">b</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">ill, we are removing the geographical restriction on the </span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">p</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">anel's existing powers</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">,</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  "> so that members can continue to carry out their important role in helping to</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">resolve disputes over takeover bids.</span></span>

But the member for Oxley's contribution mirrored, in large part, the response that has come from members opposite with respect to the overarching deregulatory agenda. That response has been, on each occasion, to support the bill for one of either of two reasons—one, a contention that the bill is unimportant; or secondly, where the bill is considered important, to support the bill on the basis that it would have been something that they, the Labor Party, were going to get around to in any event. The member for Oxley mirrored the second of those contentions. He noted bipartisan support for this bill and for all of its relevant provisions; he noted that these were the types of things that were being progressed—and that indeed these matters were being progressed—under the previous Labor government; and he, in effect—and I am paraphrasing—put the proposition that it was only a matter of time until they would have gotten around to it, in any event.</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">As has been noted by some of my colleagues, this does give rise to the question: if the members opposite had been as fulsome about their deregulatory agenda as they now claim to have been, why is there is so much left to do? Or indeed, why did the World Economic Forum, in the final year of the Labor government, note that we had slumped to 128th on the measure of burden of government regulation—nestled neatly in between Romania and Angola? But it is a proposition that Labor puts continually. Previously, the member for Isaacs has spoken on legislation under the deregulation agenda, saying: 'It is the same attitude that we had while we were in government.' Again, the member for Oxley had said previously: </span>

With particular reference to this bill, and particular reference to the point that has focused the attention of most of the speakers, which is the 100-member rule, I must say that the member for Oxley's contention—that the removal of this rule has always had bipartisan support, and that it was something that they, Labor, were getting round to in their six years of government but just did not quite get to—is not, I fear, a particularly accurate reflection of the actual history of this matter, or of Labor's position on it. It is worth looking at it in some little detail.</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">From what I can gather, the modern history of the attempts to reform this provision go back to at least 2005—in fact, it was 2000. The coalition government tried to amend the policy by regulation in 2000, and those regulations were actually disallowed. Then there was another attempt, towards the end of the Howard government, to disallow by legislation—which did not see through the life of the parliament. So this quite stupid, 100-member rule had its first attempt at being reformed in 2000. I think a number of companies who have suffered at the hands of this quite ridiculous rule might ask why it has taken so long—14 years—for this to occur. When I put the contention that this is a really quite desperately stupid piece of regulation, that is absolutely borne out by the examples.</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The example of the now notorious Woolworths matter has been mentioned. It is worth going into that in a little bit of detail, to establish the point of fact that this is a terrible piece of regulation which is now being removed.</span>

                    </span>Anyone who cares to look at the Federal Court of Australia decision in Woolworths Limited v GetUp Limited [2012] FCA 726 will see exactly what happened and the history of the matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been noted, we consider that the removal of the 100-member rule will save some very considerable amount of money for corporations over the progressive out years of the budget. In the Woolworths example, under the 100-member rule, 210 shareholders, which was 0.05 per cent of the 417,000 shareholders of Woolworths, tried to force a meeting under the relevant provision, which was section 1322 of the Corporations Act. At least we can say that, fortunately, orders were eventually issued by the Federal Court under section 1322(4)(d) of the Corporations Act that allowed for an extension of time for Woolworths so that they could coordinate the requested meeting with their actual AGM.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the matter there was some discussion of the cost that would have been incurred by Woolworths had they not been granted the extension and had the initial request been compelled upon them. They noted that the mere fact of having to mail out the notice to their membership and the construction of the meeting would have cost $550,000. They also noted that some or likely all of the 12 directors would have to attend the meeting; the directors of Woolworths were resident variously in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, New Zealand, Sydney and Melbourne; Woolworths would need to pay for flights and accommodation in respect of each director who attended the separate meeting; Woolworths accountants, solicitors and various key management personnel would need to attend; there would need to be additional time spent by key management personnel and other employees of Woolworths liaising with institutional and retail investors; the attendance of approximately 30 to 40 staff would have been required for the running of the extraordinary meeting; there would need to be attendance by a range of other people on behalf of Woolworths; and there would need to be the arranging of media facilities and conferences following the meeting and attendance by both Woolworths internal security staff and external security contractors. It was estimated that all of that would factor up to a cost of about $2 million for Woolworths if they had been compelled to see through that meeting. In the relevant Federal Court action, Woolworths used the existing provisions to argue that it was appropriate, given the great cost and inconvenience that would have been incurred by them, to have what would have in effect been a three-month delay and hold over the extraordinary general meeting to the time of the actual general meeting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That proposition was opposed by GetUp. A reading of the case shows that GetUp in opposing the request for a three-month delay to save $2 million noted that, given what they were seeking to do—which was in effect to engender a political outcome with respect to those companies that Woolworths owns that operate poker machines—was not affected in any way by the potential for having the extraordinary meeting run parallel with and at the same time as the annual general meeting. They noted and conceded in the action that there was no prejudice to GetUp from Woolworths saving themselves and their shareholders $2 million and having the three-month delay. Nevertheless, GetUp argued that its original request should stand and that Woolworths should be put to that $2 million worth of expense. I think any rational person—it seems that all members opposite, at least today, are such people—would agree that that is a seriously ridiculous state of affairs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Woolworths case is not the only example that has emerged of the incredible waste that this really quite ordinary piece of regulation has caused. Another famous example, which was the subject of a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry, was with respect to the NRMA. In that inquiry the NRMA outlined the impact that the incredibly disproportionate influence of this very silly rule was having on its business.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was in the years leading up to 2005. That is incredible waste and an incredible expense that a terribly stupid piece of legislation was putting this company to. Shamefully, that was known to be the case in 2005. The parliamentary joint committee was considering an exposure draft of the Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005, which, had it seen its way through the parliament—unfortunately, it did not—would have been the Howard government's solution to this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an initial attempt to solve the problem in 2000. A subsequent process to solve the problem commenced in 2005. Nothing was done to solve this blindingly obvious and terribly wasteful problem over the six years under Labor. Here we are now with bipartisan support 14 years after the first attempt to save the money of companies that employ Australians and that represent mum and dad shareholders across Australia. Fourteen years after first identifying and attempting to solve this problem we are solving it. That delay, we are led to believe, is explicable over the past six years of Labor simply on the basis of what the member for Oxley said, which was to the effect that whilst there was agreement that this rule was, as I have asserted, a stupid rule, it was being progressed—that is, reform of the rule—and that it was on the cards or imminent but just had not actually happened yet. Again, I must say that, looking at the history in some little detail, that does not appear to represent the true position of members opposite. In 2005, when the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services was considering the exposure draft of the Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005, which bill was trying to fix this problem with respect to the 100-member rule, there was a majority report and there was a minority report.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the minority report, which is headed—would you believe?—'Labor members' minority report', deals precisely with the 100-person rule. If we have bipartisan support for the removal of the 100-person rule now, that is a very different position to the one that members opposite had in 2005 and, I presume, during the previous six years, because what the Labor members said in their minority report was this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Notwithstanding this position—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and there they were referring to the great examples of waste that were put before this committee—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor members recognise the rights of small shareholders to access company governance processes. We also recognise that in companies with a large number of members, the threshold of 5% of voting rights necessary to call an EGM will preclude smaller shareholders from ever gaining the necessary numbers to call such a meeting. This would effectively close this avenue of shareholder participation for small shareholders acting together. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a result, Labor members favour the inclusion of a cap to operate in conjunction with the 5% rule for the number of individual members required to call an EGM. The cap would come into effect when a threshold of 5% combined shareholding could not be reached by a significant number of small shareholders acting together. Labor proposes that this cap be 1,500 members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So today we have bipartisan support for the removal of the 100-member rule and the reversion to the five per cent capital cap, which I might add is the system that exists throughout Europe, in the UK and in New Zealand. Indeed, at five per cent, we represent the lowest threshold of just about all of those jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at the pivotal time in 2005 Labor did not favour the removal of the cap. They just wanted to ratchet the cap up. Fifteen hundred might sound more substantial than 100, but to look at how ridiculous that position of Labor's was in 2005 consider this: 210 shareholders of 417,000 in the Woolworths example represented 0.05 per cent of the shareholder base, which was able to cost the entire company about $2 million. If the Labor 2005 position where you have a cap at 1,500 were adopted, instead of only 0.05 per cent of members being able to force the waste of $2 million, 0.357 per cent of members would have been able to force the waste of $2 million. It was a seriously ridiculous position that was held by Labor in 2005. What position they held during the last six years is a mystery. We can assume it was the same as their 2005 position. But I would argue that the reason for their delay was, like with many of these things, that their heart just was not in it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  In speaking in support of the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014, I would say that the corporate governance reforms being proposed are in the context of maintaining the competitiveness of Australian industry in the face of growing competition from emerging countries in our region and capitalising on the economic development opportunities provided by recent free trade agreements. A more efficient private sector will be the key to economic growth and prosperity for our nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the cost of compliance with government legislation and regulation continues to be a major impediment for businesses across Australia. If our domestic industry is to be competitive then the administrative burden of excessive bureaucracy must be lifted. Business leaders in my electorate have raised concerns that their operations are being restricted by an increasingly complex multi-tiered regulatory system, often so complex and technical that it is necessary to engage specialist consultants to achieve compliance. Small businesses to large corporations engaged in multimillion dollar projects alike are affected. The cost of compliance, coupled with additional project holding costs imposed by delays, has a detrimental effect on the financial viability of both business operations and key economic development projects.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for the Australian government is to foster a strong, competitive environment by reversing overregulation, addressing the factors which increase the cost of doing business in Australia and reforming the regulatory system to increase productivity. The development of strong policies for the business sector in the areas of corporate governance, financial services regulation and industry are required to promote the economic development of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being elected, this government has introduced more than 400 measures across the whole of government, resulting in a net reduction of over $2.1 billion in compliance costs. During this process, approximately 11,000 pieces of legislation and regulation have been repealed, removing some 57,200 pages from the statute books. The coalition government is addressing the way policymakers approach the issue of future regulation across government departments with the introduction of mandatory regulatory impact statements for all cabinet submissions and a deregulation unit in every portfolio. This will ensure that new regulation is introduced sparingly and as a means of last resort.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have previously stated in this parliament, the greatest challenge facing Australia in the 21st century is increased international competition from emerging economies in our region. In a globalised economy with free trade and mobility of investment capital across international borders, a nation's economic performance will determine living standards. Over the next decades, Australia will face unprecedented competition for resources and energy as populations seek to improve their standards of living. We will be competing with billions of people who value education and are prepared to work long hours to produce, earn, save and invest to get ahead economically.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of the Abbott government's legislative agenda on deregulation. It contains a number of measures designed to improve productivity, competitiveness and the efficiency of government processes and which are expected to reduce business compliance costs by approximately $14 million a year. The proposed amendments achieve a fair and equitable balance between safeguarding consumer and shareholder rights and eliminating unnecessary red tape which is constricting business whilst maintaining accountability and transparency and promoting adequate disclosure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, this bill seeks to abolish the existing requirement for directors of public companies to hold a general meeting at the request of a minimum of 100 shareholders—in a bid to prevent the calling of meetings for frivolous or trivial reasons. Experience has shown that activist and lobby groups with less than one per cent of the shareholding in public companies have been able to call general meetings—at significant administrative cost to the public companies—in order to move resolutions which have attracted little support. It is proposed that the new threshold for calling a general meeting be at least five per cent of the votes that may be cast at a general meeting. It is estimated that this measure will save businesses around $1.5 million per annum in compliance costs and it is supported by industry groups such as the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Governance Institute of Australia and the Business Council of Australia, as well as shareholder groups such as the Australian Shareholders' Association. Groups comprising a minimum of 100 shareholders will continue to be able to put resolutions on the agenda of general meetings and be able to circulate statements to other shareholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill proposes to remove the requirement for unlisted disclosing entities to prepare remuneration reports. This measure is expected to save unlisted disclosing entities approximately $8.5 million in compliance costs. The remuneration reports are not relevant in the case of non-listed entities because, unlike listed entities, unlisted entities are not required to have their remuneration report adopted by shareholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill attempts to clarify circumstances in which entities, including companies, registered schemes and other disclosing entities, may change their financial year end dates. The bill clarifies, but does not change, the legal operation of the existing law. This measure will put beyond doubt the conditions under which directors can determine that a financial reporting year is to be shorter than 12 months by more than seven days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the bill contains an amendment which seeks to exempt certain companies limited by guarantee from the need to appoint an auditor. This change is expected to predominantly benefit public entities with a not-for-profit focus, such as sporting and recreation related organisations, community service organisations, education-related institutions and religious organisations. Currently, all public companies are required to appoint an auditor even if they are not required to conduct a full audit of their financial records. This unnecessarily imposes a $4 million compliance burden on business, which this bill seeks to reverse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A fifth measure proposed gives the Remuneration Tribunal the authority to set the remuneration of the chair and members of the Financial Reporting Council, the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This will bring the setting of remuneration of those office holders into line with the remuneration setting of public officers more broadly and improves the efficiency of government processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, this bill aims to streamline the operation of the Takeovers Panel by allowing the panel to perform functions whilst members telecommute from overseas. It removes an outdated procedure requiring members to be present in Australia, which is likely have a positive impact on business through the more efficient resolution of applications being considered by the Takeovers Panel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package of reforms contained in the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014 will serve to ensure that the Australian economy is able to compete on a level playing field with emerging economies in our region. The growth of free trade within a globalised economy characterised by mobility of capital and investment across national borders requires the Australian economy to be in good shape to stay competitive with the rest of the world. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  This is a very valuable opportunity, in the couple of minutes I have, to highlight the unconscionable conduct of Australia's most dishonest NGO, GetUp! In 2012, GetUp! thought it would be an impressive stunt to use flaws in the Corporations Law to have 204 of their members call a $2 million meeting of the full membership and board of Woolworths—costing millions of dollars and forcing up the price of groceries. It was a stunt that, in the end, secured the support of only three per cent of those who attended—with, obviously, 97 per cent voting against the motion. This was an appalling display by a completely untrustworthy NGO. GetUp! is an organisation that has been consistently opaque in its objectives. It has a number of shadowy figures that support many of its elusive and fairly dodgy objectives, many of which are designed to be significantly anti-coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Corporations Law could in fact do with a fair bit of tightening up—$14 million of compliance requirements are removed with these changes. To think that we could have a Labor government for six years that thought it was utterly appropriate for a company limited by guarantee to be forced to appoint an auditor even if they are not required to provide an audit report—what an extraordinary omission! But then, if for six years you basically regard business as the enemy of the state, you can live with that kind of inadequate Corporations Law and do nothing about it. I am glad to say the coalition are doing something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Deregulatory and Other Measures) Bill 2014 are , in many cases, minor tightenings. There are small changes to the Remuneration Tribunal. We are better balancing the rights of shareholders. We are making sure that, if 100 shareholders wish to put something on the agenda for the next meeting of the board of a publicly listed company, that can still occur. Shareholders also still have a significant say over remuneration. Twenty-five per cent of shareholders voting no on remuneration in two successive meetings can force a spill—all of that still exists. So the Corporations Law will be significantly improved at every level and $14 million dollars in utterly ridiculous compliance costs will be removed from Australian businesses. This is the kind of thing the coalition is getting on with doing. It raises the obvious point: why couldn't six years of Labor government carry out these fairly elementary reforms? The simple answer is that it was beyond their wit. They are a Labor government that never worked with business. They regarded them as the enemy of the state. Of course, times are changing and we are improving things for business in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  During parliament this week, in fact in most question times, and during a number of debates that the government has had and many of their speakers have had, there has been all of this talk and the excitement about the free-trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea. There has been talk of the billions of dollars that it will create for the Australian economy and for Australian businesses, particularly in agriculture. There has been talk about the jobs that it will create.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this debate is quite hollow and this rhetoric—I believe it is rhetoric—is not really exposing or answering the questions that many in the community have, including in my own community. There is concern about the jobs that have been created by these free-trade agreements: who will work them? That is because within these free-trade agreements, there is the ability for people to come over here on 457 visas and for people to come over here on holiday work visas to work in this country. What we are learning every day through investigations with Fair Work Australia and what I am learning every day when I go out to workplaces is that people who are on these temporary visas here in Australia tend to be exploited. They are an underclass of workers who are being exploited in our workplaces. Our Fair Work system is struggling to handle this issue.</span>

Cleaners who are international students actually stopped work to demonstrate the exploitative conditions that they are in. They are here as international students. Their intention in coming here was to study and they wanted a part-time job, which we encourage them to do. Yet the company that they work for said, 'If you want to work for us, you have to get ABN. You have to become an Australian small business to be a cleaner.'

But what they had when they came here was the opportunity to be treated like everybody else in the workplace. They were not employed on a temporary visa. They were not subject to the position of the employer where if they stood up and said, 'I don't like what is going on in my workplace,' they could be sacked and sent home.</span>

We are learning every day—whether it is in Fair Work Australia or in other forums—about the exploitation that is occurring. We need to ensure that if people come to Australia on work visas then they do have workplace protections, we need to ensure that their conditions are maintained and we need to ensure that in any visa system that we have they have the same rights and protections as other Australia workers. There is a division within our workplaces and these free-trade agreements are not doing anything to address that. I call on the government to do the right thing by these workers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AN1" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOHN COBB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise today to speak about the importance of shopping small and supporting small businesses, especially in the lead-up to Christmas. As most of you would be aware, November is Shop Small month in Australia. If you are not familiar with this fantastic campaign, it is basically a movement dedicated to supporting our small businesses and our retailers locally. It is a fantastic initiative, as I am sure you will all agree, and one we should all be right behind for the sake of our community, our electorates and the whole fabric of our local society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take a moment to talk about some figures that were brought to my attention last week. Some of them were a real shock. According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian attitudes to small business report</span>, three-quarters of small business owners in Australia say it is getting harder to run a small business. This is something which many businesses in my electorate of Calare often bring to my attention. What I found most alarming is the fact that two in five small businesses admit that they are not sure if they will be around in five years' time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are alarming statistics and I think no-one here would not be concerned about them. I consider small business to be the backbone of my electorate in Calare and to be the backbone of society. They are just something that, if we did not have them then, we just would not realise what we had lost until we lost them. They offer so much in the way of employment opportunities, community input and support. They are the heart and soul of every local team and every local event that our communities are involved in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After speaking with some of them in Calare, I was delighted to learn that they are not going to just bow down to the huge internet overseas traders. They are getting on the front foot and implementing a raft of new strategies to ensure they remain competitive. The strategies that they are looking at include investing in an online or social media presence; price discounting; increasing marketing and advertising; negotiating better deals with suppliers, individually or by getting together; increasing the range of products sold; forming alliances with other businesses; investing in new technology; and considering longer opening hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are all great ideas, but they can be quite wearing too. I am sure you will agree that it is simply not enough. These small businesses need us, and everyone in our electorates, get behind them and support them. Those of us living in small towns—as do the majority of people in my electorate of Calare and the majority of people in western New South Wales—need to shop locally. I am urging everyone to think twice next time they are looking at buying something online, especially in this lead-up to Christmas. You may save a little bit of money buying overseas or online but you are missing out on great customer service. You are missing out on a chance to catch-up on everything that happens in your region. And every dollar spent locally goes into the local community and benefits everybody. It benefits your friends. It benefits your neighbours and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in a bid to kick-along the Shop Small Month campaign in Calare, for the last few weeks I have run a social media campaign urging residents of Calare to vote for their favourite small businesses. I must admit, I was unsure what support the campaign would get at first, but it has been an overwhelming success. Local business chambers and associations, local councils and businesses have got right behind the idea and so has the public, with lots of public votes still coming in now. Once voting closes at the end of the month, I plan to visit those businesses that receive the most votes and make a special presentation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I felt this competition was a good addition to the Shop Small Month, and the feedback we got from around the region has been fantastic, because when people know something like this is happening suddenly they realise how well they are treated and the service they get locally. It takes them a minute to get online and vote. They go out in the morning and suddenly think, 'Yes, I was terribly well treated. You can't get treated like that online.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We really need the community's support. The last thing we want is small business to disappear because if it does, Calare is gone too.  I have got to tell you, I am proud of my small business.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  On 27 October this year, it was Pink Ribbon Day. On that day, I was to rise to give a 90-second statement to help emphasise the importance of supporting efforts by the Cancer Council to raise funds in support of many thousands of women affected by breast cancer. That morning, I received a call from home informing me that my wife, Jodi Dack, had had her cancer return. So, instead, that morning I was on a plane so that I could go and comfort her, after she had already endured fighting for 26 months when the breast cancer was originally detected in August 2012. Her endurance and courage were remarkable and inspiring, and I have no doubt she will bring the same resolve and the same bravery to fighting once again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise not just on behalf of my loved one. I rise on behalf of all women—the many thousands—affected by breast cancer. One in eight will develop breast cancer in their lifetime in Australia. Fifteen thousand or more women are predicted to be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. Improvements in survival rates are attributed to improved treatments and diagnosis for breast cancer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with this in mind that I wish to highlight an application requesting Medicare Benefits Schedule listing, primarily of breast MRI to guide treatment in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, which was received from the Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand by the Department of Health and Ageing in September 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of breast MRI is proposed to offer improved local staging and/or early treatment, monitoring and planning. The proposed indications are (1) women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing pre-operative chemotherapy; (2) women newly diagnosed with lobular subtype breast cancer; (3) women newly diagnosed with breast cancer who are (a) aged under 50 and/or (b) have very dense breasts which preclude mammographic assessment, and/or (c) have a significant size discrepancy between mammogram and ultrasound findings, or (d) have suspicious/malignant calcifications which may underestimate the extent of ductal carcinoma in situ disease; and (4) women presenting with metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes where conventional imaging and examination fails to show the source of the tumour. The use of breast MRI is also proposed for MRI guided biopsy in patients with suspected breast cancer where the lesion is only identifiable by MRI. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Breast MRI is not currently listed on the MBS for these purposes, and therefore this application by the Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand is a very important one. It came in under the previous government and would, of course, be considered by this government. The application is for five new MBS items for women of any age who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise not just because of my own personal circumstances; I rise on behalf of all women who have breast cancer or who may face the threat of it. And I do not rise in a partisan manner. I rise in a bipartisan manner in the hope that the parliament considers this matter and that the executive considers the merits of such improvements to breast cancer treatment and appreciates how such an approach is likely either to prevent incurable cancer—which can occur once the cancer becomes secondary—or to extend the life of women who may have cancer, where that cancer can go into remission </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have done remarkable things. Australia has been a leading country in this very important area. We have great institutions that do wonderful things. We have great foundations like the McGrath Foundation that raise this issue and bring it to the attention of many millions of Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just raise this submission in relation to the application made by the Breast Surgeons of Australia, because it is timely and it is something we can do. We all know that there are budgetary considerations and fiscal challenges for any government, but this, I think, is a significant matter. It is something that I hope the government pays due attention to and that we can move forward as a parliament and provide better opportunities for women in Australia dealing with such a challenge. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Sometimes it is worth reflecting on in this House that as representatives of the Australian people we have a responsibility to ensure we are informing our constituents and the broader Australian community about the limits of government and what governments are actually capable of providing or not providing. When I am in my electorate meeting with local residents, I try to make a point of ensuring that I cover off on constituents' concerns in relation to what we are doing as a government to get the budget back under control. We as a government have chosen to act with maturity to make the tough decisions now—to make the decisions that may be unpopular and cause some short-term pain for the long-term gain of this great country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been left with the mighty task of cleaning up the mess after six years of waste and mismanagement at the hands of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. It is no thanks to the actions of the former government that we are at a point now where approximately 50 per cent of Australians pay little, if any, income tax once government benefits are taken into account. The reverse of that situation is that the top 10 per cent of income earners now pay approximately 45 per cent or more of all income tax. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Speaker, you might ask the question: why is this important? It is important because we face a demographic problem. We have an ageing population. Today there are five people in the workforce for every one retiree. Of those retirees, eight out of 10 receive a part or a full pension. Of the 20 per cent that do not, 12 per cent still receive some kind of assistance with health costs through the health care card. So, only eight per cent of our current retiree population is genuinely self-sufficient—eight per cent, and that is after a generation of compulsory superannuation.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's fast forward 50 years—or not even that; let's fast forward to the middle of this century, when there will be three people in the workforce for every one who is retired. Under current policy settings, guess how many of those retirees are receiving a part or a full pension? It is approximately 80 per cent. Around 11 per cent will be eligible for some sort of health care card—and this is after three generations of compulsory superannuation. The picture that we have now will not change by mid-century, yet we know that in the decade commencing 2020 it is estimated that there will only be some 100,000 new entrants into the labour market for an entire decade. This compares to 2004, when there were 125,000 entrants into the labour market in one year alone. I think this paints a stark picture of why we need to make long-term decisions to ensure that we have an economy that is productive, efficient, competitive and able to create wealth and income that we will need as a nation in the future to sustain our living standards. As I said, higher life expectancy and a falling birth rate are increasing the proportion of elderly people across the country. We need to ensure that we are able to have a welfare system that provides the pensions, health care and age care that people have come to expect. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Throughout the month of November, the Shop Small campaign is being held across Australia. This is an incredibly important movement that promotes the efforts of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who establish, own or work in the small business sector and it also recognises the positive role small businesses play in our communities. I am pleased to have joined my parliamentary colleagues in the launch in Parliament House and both sides of the House are working together to encourage people in their local communities to shop at their local small businesses, especially in this crucial period leading up to Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The small business sector is vitally important to the Australian economy; small business employs more than 5 million Australians and contributes around 47 per cent of private sector employment. In South Australia, I was pleased to read that 90 per cent of consumers visit a local small business at least once a week. This campaign is trying to encourage this to occur more regularly. If we do shop locally, then we are ensuring that our communities continue to thrive in turn creating jobs and stimulating the local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not always easy to own and run a small business and we know there is a lot of effort put in by many people—hours of unpaid work—to ensure their business gets up and running and thrives. Therefore we should do everything we can to support our local businesses—whether it is the local grocer, baker or butcher and a range of other businesses in your local area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I visited several small businesses in the seat of Kingston. First I caught up with Norm, who owns Morphett Vale Fresh Bakery with his wife, Liz. Norm said one of the biggest challenges they face as a small business is competing with the larger supermarket chains. Norm proudly told me that he sells two loaves of fresh bread for $5. The price and quality are more than competitive with the supermarkets, but Norm said customers go into their bakery for their award winning pies  but then go off to the supermarket to purchase bread without realising it is often cheaper to buy it at his bakery. Norm said one of the challenges he faces is changing consumers' attitudes and habits so that they do buy local—and that is what Shop Small month is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then visited Model Mania in Morphett Vale—owned by Don and Merilyn for an impressive 29 years. They sell a range of different models. It is a very exciting shop which people should visit for gifts for loved ones at Christmas—there were planes, spaceships and a whole range of things to put together. In speaking to Don and Merilyn, they face different challenges to Norm and Liz, but, like so many small businesses, they are under increasing pressure from cheap, online overseas products. But Don and Merilyn have not given up; they value add in their service, knowledge and ability to meet their customers' needs. While they have to compete with online shopping they are finding ways to ensure their customers get what they want. I must say it is excellent service and, with 29 years' experience, it is certainly worth a visit around Christmas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These examples are just two of the 2500 small businesses in my electorate, providing locals with jobs and boosting the economy. A lot of small businesses not only employ people but also give back to the community. On the weekend it was the Christies Beach Christmas Pageant, where we saw many local businesses participate, giving back to the local community and bringing joy to many young people. In this Shop Small Month I would encourage people all around Australia in the lead up to Christmas to shop local and shop small. I know some members of parliament have demonstrated local fashion and I hope that people continue to support their local businesses.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I rise to speak on an issue of utmost concern to all Victorians—the future of our state. This Saturday, people in Victoria will go to the polls and they will be presented with a stark choice. On one hand, we have the strong, stable Napthine coalition government with a proven track record of delivering jobs, growth and opportunity and the biggest modernisation plan in Victoria's history. On the other hand is the rabble that is the state Labor opposition with its legacy of delivering dud projects. Who can forget the desal plant, the north-south pipeline, smart meters and myki, to name just a few? It is led by Dan Andrews—or Daniel Andrews or Andrew Daniels—who is led by his militant CFMEU mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is impossible to overstate what is at stake on Saturday—it is the future of my home state of Victoria. Over the past four years, the Napthine government has been at hard work building a better Victoria by strengthening the economy to help create more jobs, building a world-class transport network, ensuring that we have 21st century schools and hospitals and making stronger and safer communities. The coalition has also delivered the best financial results in more than a decade with a $2 billion surplus in 2013-14 and has maintained the AAA credit rating to ensure the economy continues to grow, attracting investment and, importantly, more jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has delivered record results for on-time trains and trams and is slashing fares as a result. They will build the long-awaited Airport Rail Link, amongst many other road and public transport projects. The coalition has also delivered a record $15 billion for hospitals and health services and is building 24 new schools with major upgrades to many others. One of the more popular initiatives of this government has been the 1700 Protective Service Officers on the public transport network, so that people feel safe as they go to and from work or other commitments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear therefore that the coalition has delivered in the last four years. In Melbourne's east, in my electorate of Deakin, the coalition has started construction on the $66 million upgrade of the Ringwood train station. The notorious Mitcham and Rooks Road level crossings are now just a bad memory with the Blackburn Road level crossing slated for an upgrade soon. And businesses and families alike are eagerly awaiting the East West Link and the reduced travel times, 7000 new jobs and productivity boost that it will give the Victorian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, what does Labor have to offer? We know they are not offering the East West Link. Dan Andrews has vowed to tear up the contracts, costing Victorian taxpayers over a $1billion in compensation claims and $3 billion of lost federal funding. In my view such reckless behaviour gives us an insight that the Labor Party in Victoria only governs for those who live in the handful of inner-city electorates that are at risk from the Greens, all at the expense of those of us who live in the outer suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor cannot be trusted to honour a contract to build the East west Link, they cannot be trusted to manage the budget or the economy. 'Desal Dan', as he is known in my parts, still thinks a desalination plan—that costs Victorian taxpayers $1.8 million a day for 27 years without providing a drop of water—is a good idea. Victorians cannot afford to afford to risk a Labor government with a premier who is happy to have union thugs represented in his cabinet and is willing to sell out the interests of workers and taxpayers to the dictates of the CFMEU. Victorians cannot afford to risk a Labor government that has made the reckless promise of $33 billion, without any explanation to date on how it is to be funded and the centrepiece of their election strategy is their promise to upgrade 50 railway level crossings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In three years the coalition has completed 18 grade separations. How many did Labor do in 11 years? Eight. It will only take 70 years for the Labor Party on this track record to remove the 50 level crossings they have promised. In Labor we outsource our democracy to the bosses of the CFMEU— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  In 2012, South Australians were disappointed by the decision by BHP Billiton to shelve a $30 billion expansion of the Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs. Olympic Dam is one of South Australia's most significant ore bodies with copper, uranium, gold and silver worth at least $1 trillion, and a deposit so big it would take 200 years to mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election the coalition said that we would remove any government impediments to the future expansion of Olympic Dam and work with BHP on ways that we could assist, particularly in terms of approval processes and political stability in decision making. We approached BHP shortly after the election to discuss such issues as one-stop environmental approval procedures and certainty about the carbon and mining taxes. We repealed the carbon tax and we repeal the mining tax. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September the federal government helped cut through the green tape with a ruling that a trial of heap leaching technology could proceed without the extra cost or lost time of more environmental checks on top of the existing environmental impact statement that had already been done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday in question time I asked the Minister for Industry about the benefits of the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement to the resource sector. Amongst the many benefits of the FTA is the elimination of tariffs on copper and uranium. BHP is expecting a big rise in demand for those commodities over the next few decades. Annual demand for copper is expected to rise from 27 million to 40 million tonnes by 2030. There will also be higher demand for uranium from China as it reduces its usage of fossil fuel and shifts to nuclear energy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">BHP Billiton's CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, told his AGM that BHP are looking at using that heap leaching technology to expand Olympic Dam in stages, ramping up copper production from 184,000 tonnes a year now to 450,000 tonnes a year by 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If uranium production grew proportionately it would be at least 10,000 tonnes a year. These plans would turn Olympic Dam into the world's second-biggest copper mine and potentially the world's biggest uranium mine. This level of expansion would mean a significant boost to South Australia's economy—which everyone knows is flagging—and thousands of potential jobs. However, as BHP's chief financial officer, Peter Beaven, has said, this is not a slam dunk. As he said, if we are going to get this project up we are really going to need the support of the broader community, the support of the government and so on. The Prime Minister has already indicated that the coalition government will assist however it can to advance the Olympic Dam expansion. If this project goes ahead, it will be significant for our state for the next 100 years. I think that South Australians should be optimistic about this project and make it clear to BHP, to the state government and to the federal government that they fully support an expansion of the Olympic Dam mine. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I rise to speak about an important local event held in my electorate last Thursday, which was the dedication of new plaques at the memorial walkway at Kingscliff and the presentation of a portrait of Rowan Robinson to his parents, Marie and Peter Robinson. I would like to thank the Kingscliff RSL sub-branch, in particular Vice President Brian Vickery, for inviting me to the dedication and also for the honour of presenting a portrait of Rowan to his parents. Sapper Rowan Robinson was serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan when he was tragically killed in action on 6 June 2011. The presentation reflected our community's heartfelt condolences for the Robinson family, and it also reflected our community's strong respect and admiration for the outstanding young man that Rowan was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rowan Robinson was a Kingscliff man who was very active and connected to the Tweed, having attended schools in both Murwillumbah and Kingscliff. He also went to nippers at the local surf club and graduated to the senior club as a patrolling member. He was an exceptionally talented sportsman who did very well at both rugby at school and golf, which he continued right up until he joined the Army. Rowan was a fit, healthy, active young man who was always a team player. I am told he was extremely popular as a person, as a competitor and as a worker who set an outstanding example for others. Rowan joined the Army in 2006, and it was on his second deployment to Afghanistan that he was tragically killed in June 2011. Rowan's commanding officer said of him:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Everything he turned his hand to produced outstanding results. Without fail, he would jump at the challenge of leading our operators to their objective, risking his life so that others may live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we as a community and as a country always remember Rowan's service and sacrifice. That is why it was an honour to have been involved in the presentation of the portrait at the memorial walkway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The portrait was painted by Jason Swain, an Australian artist who lives in America. Jason had written to the Kingscliff RSL and advised that he was undertaking the project to paint the portraits of Australian diggers who were killed in action in Afghanistan. The Kingscliff RSL took the opportunity to present this portrait to Rowan's parents in the very special place that is the memorial walkway, which was established in 2007. Kingscliff RSL designed the walkway and plaque dedications to reflect Australians at war in numerous settings. Each year new plaques are added, and each year local schools are involved in new projects for the new plaques. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the role of the Wommin Bay nursing home and also the Tweed Shire Council and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The original idea for the walkway had been for carers and staff from the nursing home to be able to walk patients to the beach along the walkway and to view the ocean. It is a wonderful, accessible memorial that is very much a part of the local community and, in fact, it is not just used by residents of the local nursing home—locals and visitors use the pathway, and it is wonderful in the sense that it is a living memorial. The plaques are there for the people to see as they walk along the walkway either to the beach or to the view out to the ocean. I would particularly like to thankful and acknowledge the work of the Kingscliff RSL for both these latest additions to the memorial walkway and the portrait presentation. It was an absolute honour and a privilege to attend.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I proudly rise to talk about Friday's opening of a new terminal at the Orange Airport. This project is part of the broader Orange Airport expansion project which is expected to be completed by mid-2015. It has been a long time coming, but after visiting the terminal last week I can guarantee you that the wait has been well worthwhile. The project will enhance the airport's ability to function as a hub for a range of aviation related activities. It is part of an almost $19 million upgrade. The runway has been expanded, taxiways have been widened and straightened, there are new lights and markings and there is a large aircraft parking area being constructed. And of course there is an upgrade of the general aviation area, which I think is what people coming to a very important regional area like Orange would expect, and have every reason to—because Orange is not just a city, it is the centre of a very important region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can imagine the expansion will have enormous benefit for Orange and the region. It will encourage and enhance tourism, ensure better access to world-class medical services of which Orange is one of the few serious regional medical centres in New South Wales let alone Australia. It will help decentralise business, increase access to mine sites. The runway expansion will make it far more efficient for larger aircraft, particularly jets, to land as well as offer more reliable and timely flight services to centres like Sydney and possibly other regions and other capitals as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these points will be of huge benefit to the Orange region and I am thrilled the federal government did invest the almost $5 million into this project. In total, there was almost $90 million with Orange council putting in over $10 million, Cadia Valley Operations putting in $2½ million and the New South Wales government putting in $1.3 million. It proves that government agrees with my view that Orange is a crucial link in Australia's regions. It is the centre of probably the oldest part of regional Australia since European settlement without doubt. It is what they found when they left the Sydney basin. It is where agriculture and mining seriously began in Australia. The community continues to grow and so does the dependence on being able to access reliable transport and the upgrade does that. Our community cannot stand still, particularly young vibrant well situated community like the Central West. I am very happy to see Orange and the region continue to grow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  On behalf of the Kingsford-Smith community, I wish to condemn the Abbott government for cutting $254 million from the budget of the ABC over the next five years and for deceiving and misleading the Australian people about his support for our nation's public broadcaster. On the night before the last election, we all know that commitment that the Prime Minister gave to the people of Australia: no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no changes to pensions and, importantly, no cuts to the ABC or SBS. That was the commitment that our Prime Minister gave the people of Australia—completely obliterated in the last couple of days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC is revered by members of our community who believe that a strong, well funded, independent public broadcaster is the hallmark of democracy. The strength of democracy is related to the strength of the ABC and its ability to program and to report the news. The ABC provides the most independent news broadcast service in Australia. We are heading into bushfire season and many people in rural and regional communities rely on the advice that they get through the ABC about the impending threat of bushfires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A great producer of Australian drama, a great promoter of the arts, in particular music, and, importantly, the unearther of new talent in Australia. Many young Australian artists who have gone on to great success in many walks of life have got their start at the ABC. This is now under threat due to the Abbott government's cuts. Four hundred jobs are going to go for the broadcaster over the coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately the closure of rural and regional facilities and programs means, in particular, sport is going to suffer under these changes including the ABC's coverage of the local Shute Shield rugby. For many in my electorate, turning on the ABC to catch the local club rugby game of the week is a ritual. And of course the galloping Greens, the mighty Randwick club, is one that features regularly on the ABC. The Sydney club scene is the foundation of rugby union in this country. It will not help by having that program cut on a Saturday afternoon, and the fans are not happy. On Facebook, AJ Dundas wrote: 'Are we still going to see the Shute Shield on the ABC next year? Or has Tony Abbott "not cut" that as well?' Well, Mr Dundas, the Shute Shield, the VFL, the WAFL, the NTFL, the W-League and the WNBL have all been cut as a result of this government's callous approach to the ABC. I wholeheartedly, on behalf of our community, condemn the Abbott government for the ABC cuts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  In this place we often debate the role of government—its size and breadth, and those areas where public policy affects our society and its people. However, it is important for all members to remember that what makes this nation truly strong are the individuals and families around this country that bind together to make great communities. These communities are dynamic, innovative and resilient. They nurture children, support each other and care for those who are vulnerable. This spring I have been mindful of this as I have been out and about in my electorate of Higgins, meeting with community groups who, on their own initiative, make an invaluable and irreplaceable contribution to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the warming weather in Melbourne, the number of community festivals across my electorate is astounding, and I have strived to attend as many as humanly possible within my weekly schedule. I attended the Pink Tennis Day for women and girls at the Malvern Tennis Centre in Armadale, which raised $4,000 for the Breast Cancer Network Australia. I took part with thousands of people in the Murrumbeena Relay For Life—the longest continuous running relay in Victoria. I held a stall at the Stonnington Spring into Gardening festival in Prahran, where I was visited by our foreign minister, Hon. Julie Bishop MP. I represented the Prime Minister at the Oakleigh Greek Glendi Unity Through Diversity Festival at Warrawee Park in Oakleigh. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Remembrance Day, I participated in remembrance services held by the Toorak RSL and later, on Remembrance Day itself, at De La Salle College, Victoria Gardens, with the Prahran RSL. I also attended, representing the Prime Minister, an afternoon reception at Anzac House to launch 'Tribute to Gallipoli'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was such fun to open the Solway Primary School fair in Ashburton after participating in a hard-fought spelling bee with some of their very charming children—no pressure in that! Similarly, I was yet again impressed by the strong attendance and local spirit at the St Kevin's College Family Fun Day and the Malvern Primary School Spring Fair. Just last weekend, I helped out at the sausage sizzle at the Very Special Kids Fair, an annual fundraising fair for the largest and oldest children's hospice in Australia. It is an extraordinary organisation and an organisation that deserves all of our support. Most recently, I held a stall at the Ashburton festival, a wonderful opportunity for traders and the local community to get together in advance of Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just a snapshot of what has been happening within my electorate and, I know, in communities all across this great country. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet with local people and I am inspired by their endeavour and their ingenuity. They reaffirm my belief in volunteerism, civil society and small and competent government. Most importantly, they inspire me to continue in my work in representing their interests to the best of my ability and to ensure good government for all Australians and a better future for our nation.</span>

Prior to entering politics, I worked for CRS Australia. It is a wonderful organisation. It was established at the end of the Second World War to help soldiers and servicemen re-enter the workforce after they had been injured at war. It is an organisation that has operated ever since then and is an organisation that has helped many, many people over the years. The Charlestown office is due to close at the end of next week. I actually worked in that office at one time. It used to be a vibrant organisation that provided people with assistance when they needed to live independently in the community and then helped them with looking for work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is wonderful. It is a fantastic initiative supported by both sides of this House. There is no-one that could support it more than I do. The services that it offers look after people in the community and help them with all aspects of life, but it does not have a responsibility for the work component. I think that is something that CRS did very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my job at CRS I used to give people vocational assessments. Once I had given them vocational assessments, I would then work to find employers that were prepared to offer somebody with a disability an opportunity to work, and there was an enormous amount of success. People that found themselves in that environment went on to be the most fantastic employees that you could ever imagine. We would go in and do a workplace assessment. Once that workplace assessment was done, it would be organised so it best suited the needs of that person and the employer, so it was a win-win situation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tender has been put out into the community and tenders have been awarded to some organisations. I have great concern about one organisation that has been awarded for tender, and I will probably be raising this in the parliament at some time. I will be talking to the minister. I think that it is so sad that we are losing an organisation that has contributed so much to our nation and helped so many people over the years.</span>

Light Up Camden marks the beginning of the festive season in Camden and has become a major annual event on the community calendar.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again the festival drew large crowds this year, and these crowds were treated to a wide variety of activities and attractions. These included a visit from Santa, exciting rides, lively Zumba demonstrations, great food stalls, a sideshow alley and a fireworks display. Residents were also lucky enough to be entertained by a wide range of community acts and school performances, which showcased the talented people and energetic community spirit we have in the Macarthur region. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Entertainment included performances by Ali's Angels, Dynamic Rhythms Music Centre, Utopia Music school, Macarthur School of Physical Culture, Rebecca's Dance Studio, and individual musical pieces by Chris Willis and Isabel Estephan. Numerous local primary and high schools also provided entertainment, which included Macarthur Anglican School, Elderslie High School, Mawarra Public School, Camden South Public School, Narellan Vale Public School and Mount Annan Public School. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Towards the end of the evening, there was an electric atmosphere as the community gathered around the town centre to count down to the lighting of the town Christmas tree and view the spectacular firework display. It was a perfect conclusion to the wonderful event. Not only were local residents given the chance to celebrate together as a community but it also provided a wonderful opportunity for local businesses to display their products and services to the fast-growing Macarthur area.</span>

Planning of the festival begins in January each year and would not be possible without the hundreds of hours the Light Up Camden committee volunteers put in each year.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  Last Thursday, I was proud to attend a special event: a financial services oath-taking ceremony in my electorate. Vern Fettke is a justice of the peace, a bail justice and the principal of Homestead Financial Group. Vern is a member of our community who gives and at all times acts with integrity. When Labor introduced the FoFA legislation last year, Vern related to me that he was insulted because he knew that his financial service always acted in the best interest of the client, alerted their clients of all charges and had a continuous relationship with clients—exactly what the changes implemented by the previous Labor government were designed to ensure. But Vern also knew there were some in the industry for whom that was not the prime motivation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, as we have seen in recent media reports, not all financial services did have their clients as their centrepoint. After the current government changed regulations earlier this year to wind back the FoFA laws, Vern Fettke could see the impact on the industry. The changes meant that other providers, perhaps driven by commissions, would not necessarily have the client's best interests as their motivator, that they could just revert to unscrupulous practices citing 'buyer beware' as the justification.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now apparent that the majority of our senators could see that too. It has been said that sometimes the Senate saves the government from itself, and I think we can safely say that that is what the Australian Senate did last week. So when the regulations were changed, when the consumer protections were removed, this small western suburbs financial service led by Vern and his team decided to innovate. This company had always been proud of their work, lived their values and operated with integrity. They wanted to ensure that their values were public, that the clients could rely on their integrity. So Vern and his team developed an oath—the financial services oath—and last Saturday I joined a gathering of many of their clients and leaders in our community to witness the people who work for Homestead take that solemn oath. That oath was a statement of integrity—not a marketing ploy but a solemn oath, a statement of honest intention and service. Like Vern, I hope this initiative will be adopted more broadly and good people working in financial services will be supported by their communities when they take this oath. I congratulate Vern and his team for taking the oath and for having so many people present to witness them do so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  The death of Verdun Edward Pearn in September marked the end of an era for the small rural town of Westbury in the northern part of my electorate of Lyons, a town which for nearly 30 years has been the home of the intriguing Pearns Steam World. Despite being the second oldest of the Pearn clan of five, Verdun, aged 97, was the last surviving sibling—perhaps that had something to do with his inquiring mind. Verdun 's niece, Ruth Patterson, said that even as a small child he had an inquiring mind. One day the enterprising young Verdun dragged the cream separator out of the dairy, took the cups-ups off it, laid it on its side and placed a metal disk on top of the spindle. Cranking the handle as fast as he could, Verdun watched in amazement as the metal disk flew off at speed and disappeared through two fences, never to be seen again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Verdun was always tinkering and at 15 he made model steam engine which is still in the amazing array of steam powered machines and artefacts on display at Pearn Steam World. After World War II Verdun and his two brothers, Zenith and Jack, formed their own Pearn Brothers Company and together ran the agricultural contracting business in the local area. It was together as a team that the three brothers also decided later on in life to collect one of every brand of steam engine that worked in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1968 they held Tasmania's first steam rally at the family's Sunnyside property at Hagley. It soon became an annual event. So when the close-knit trio of brothers contemplated retirement they gathered together their steam engines and moved them to town to transform the former Westbury livestock saleyards into Pearns Steam World. Verdun was a quiet, shy man by nature but he learnt to speak to visitors by discussing his lifelong passion for steam. Verdun was the last of his siblings—Jack, Zen, Joan and Gwen—so his death marks the end of an era.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now very much up to the local community to take over the enormous legacy that Verdun and his brothers have left not only the people of the Meander Valley but also the community of Tasmania. I understand the passion that many people have for steam, and the Pearn brothers are intrinsically linked to steam in my state of Tasmania. They have saved many steam engines that would have otherwise gone the way of the dinosaur. They have done a wonderful job, and I encourage anybody that is passing through Westbury to visit Pearns Steam World. </span>

No-one could come away from such a visit unaffected. The suffering of people displaced by the violence in Syria cannot be ignored by the world community. The humanitarian response and a longer term political solution to a crisis must be supported by the international community, including Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a very prosperous and generous nation and we must step up and meet our obligations when it comes to this crisis. Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are contributing a significant amount of resources to an unprecedented influx of Syrian refugees. The burden on these nations cannot be ignored by the international community, and we should be doing all we can to assist. Half of Syria's 12 million population is currently displaced. Countries neighbouring Syria have already received around four million people fleeing the war. Their capacity to continue to host so many refugees for an extended period of time is being seriously stretched. Lebanon alone has a population of a little over four million people. It is currently hosting 1.5 million refugees from Syria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must substantially increase Australia's contribution to the UN and relief organisations in delivering humanitarian assistance to people affected by the violence in Syria. This should include increasing the support for the UN agencies operating in neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from financially doing our fair share—which is calculated by Oxfam to be $117.6 million—there is also a role for Australia through our humanitarian and refugee migration program. In August the coalition announced 4,400 places for refugees from Iraq and Syria fleeing violence and persecution. These places are not an overall increase to Australia's humanitarian intake but are part of the existing 13,750 places that we offer annually. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This number is low, and—given the circumstances that we now find ourselves in in the Middle East—this needs to be reviewed. The government should also be working with the UNHCR to consider the needs of people displaced by violence in Iraq and Syria and to prioritise placing these groups. We can be doing more. We need to be doing more. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. At its heart this bill goes to what we in the coalition see as the role of government. It is about freeing the hands of our entrepreneurs—encouraging them to take risks, encouraging them to experiment with new products, and encouraging them to experiment and strive for new markets—because that is what creates the wealth in our nation. In contrast, those on the other side of the chamber are more fixated on central planning where you have a lot of bureaucrats handling the levers of the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing this goes to is our understanding that you have to create the wealth of this country through hard work and through entrepreneurial activity. The welfare of our nation is not a fixed pie, as so many members of the opposition seem to think, so that the size is fixed and you just argue about how to cut it to redistribute the pie. The coalition believe it is about growing the size of the pie. We also need to remember that if we engage in policies that harm our small business community especially, put red tape in their way, burn them with mandating the use of inefficient forms of electricity generation that costs them more, those things can cause the size of the pie to shrink. So we need to make sure that we are doing everything possible to increase the size of the economic pie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two hundred years of economic history have shown that the best way to do this is to encourage risk and to provide opportunity because it is the provision of opportunity that creates the innovation that we need to create new goods and services, to create new forms of communication and new methods of transport, to create new medicines. These all help to increase our prosperity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A fortnight ago we had the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. One of the reasons the Berlin Wall came down was the failure of central planning, where bureaucrats trying to run the economy took away hope, reward and opportunity. Countries locked behind the Iron Curtain simply did not create the new goods and the new markets to build prosperity. Their economies collapsed, as did their societies, and eventually the Berlin Wall came down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is all about encouraging our entrepreneurs in export markets. Ultimately, 98 per cent of the world's GDP occurs beyond our shores. When we talk about hope, reward and opportunity, it is not just within the Australian landscape; we need opportunities for Australian exporters to sell their goods to the world. Exporters can do that. In Australia, we produce good products. This bill is part of a suite of measures to encourage people to take the risk in overseas markets. We scrapped the carbon tax at the start because it acted as a reverse tariff. So if you were doing any type of manufacturing work in Australia you would pay the carbon tax, but if you were producing those same goods offshore, you did not pay the tax. That put our manufacturers, our own people, at a competitive disadvantage in the export market field. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we are doing is free trade agreements. We have seen them with South Korea, with Japan and with China. These absolutely remarkable achievements will create so more opportunities for Australian entrepreneurs to sell goods to those markets, creating wealth and prosperity in this nation. Recently, we had a visit from the Indian Prime Minister. Our free trade agreement with India is a work in progress, another market which our entrepreneurs can target, to find just a little niche to market to more than 1.2 billion Indian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues exporters often have is how they to finance exports. It is great to bring an export order back home in your pocket but often the thing is how you are going to finance it. This is something I can speak about from practical experience. Before I came to this place, I was working in a small family business and I was responsible for a lot of the export orders. I travelled to places like Singapore and Thailand. I did work in Indonesia. I travelled extensively through the Middle East. I did work in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon and even the USA and Canada. You would bundle your samples up under your arm, you would take them on the plane and go to sit in a boardroom to try to get export orders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Australian company, everywhere I went I found that representing an Australian company I was given a great deal of respect. Often the hardest part of the job was not getting the order. It was coming back and organising the production and the finance for that production. That is what Efic does. It helps those small businesses by providing extra opportunity for them to get the finance that they need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an overly concentrated banking sector here in Australia. That is great for bank profits; it is great for people that have shares in the banks. But for those small businesses that pay all of those high fees and charges, it is not so great. So Efic comes in to provide that export finance, where our banks are unable to provide it. It also provides insurance, because when you export there are always the questions of: how you are going to get paid? What guarantee of payment do you have? What are the risks of not getting paid? You often do not have access to Australian court systems when you are dealing overseas. Yes, you can negotiate to obtain a letter of credit, but the questions are: what is the strength of the bank that provides that letter of credit? What are the terms of that letter of credit? What documents do you need to provide? There are many risks in our exporters not getting paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing Efic provides is insurance premiums. You can actually go to Efic and say, 'I've got this risk; it's a commercial risk. What's the premium given that I will not get paid?' For a small premium, you take that risk, so if something goes wrong—if there is a political risk or an insolvency risk—you can actually insure against that through Efic. That, again, encourages our entrepreneurs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An important thing to note is that our financing of Efic through government is not a leg-up, handout or subsidy to our business community; Efic actually returns a profit. Last year it returned a profit of $22 million; it is actually funding itself and returning a profit to the taxpayer for the money that is invested as well as providing these valuable services to our exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last budget, this government put another $200 million equity injection into Efic. That will help Efic loan more, provide more funds and become a stronger organisation to get out there and help promote and educate businesses in Australia to have a go at those markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on to what this bill does: previously Efic could only fund the export of capital goods. If a business that produced non-capital goods and had an export order and went to Efic, Efic would say, 'Sorry, we can't help you.' This bill changes that. We are opening it up where it can be all goods—capital or non-capital. If you are an Australian business that can go offshore, get an export order, produce the goods in the country and have difficulty with financing the production—as often some things can take 12 months to produce, and it can be 12 months or longer until you actually get paid for the goods you produce—Efic will now give you that working capital. That service is now available, because of the changes that we are making to both capital and non-capital goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the things that we need to do. We went into the last election with the words: hope, reward and opportunity. We want to extend that; we want to encourage the entrepreneurs in our country, we want to encourage those small business people to get out there and have a crack in those export markets. Yes, there are risks. We know a lot of the time companies might have to change their product, or their product may not fit in certain markets. But with 98 per cent of the world's economy beyond our shores, that is the message we want to give to the exporters—those wealth creators that create the wealth for this nation and help expand the size of the pie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are things like this important? We hear a lot of whingeing from the other side about cuts to this and cuts to that, and how unfair it is. Ultimately, the wealth that we create is driven by the entrepreneurs of this country. The more opportunity we can give to them, the greater we free up their hands to get out there and have a go. The more wealth we can create, the more money will flow into the government coffers, which means the more we can spend on many of those much-needed social programs. That is what this is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can never forget the current financial situation that we are in. Often we talk about debt, deficit, surpluses and balanced budgets, but I think perhaps an easier way to talk about it is that for the last six years the previous government were running this country at a loss. Every year, as the government, they were losing money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last budget—2013-14—where all the parameters were set by the previous Labor government, we actually lost $48½ billion. This was the sixth loss in a year. For every single year they were simply running the country at a loss. What that 'running the country at a loss' means is we have had to borrow the money to cover the loss. There is no problem borrowing money—we are a wealthy country and we can borrow that money. But what it creates is an obligation to pay the interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the country has been running at a loss for six years, the obligation we have to pay that interest is now $13.5 billion every year. That is just the interest. It is not paying one cent of the principal. It is over $1 billion every single month we as the Commonwealth government now have to find. We have to take that money and pay about 70 per cent of it overseas—out of the country—to pay the debt on the six years of loss. That is why bills like this are so important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are going to dig ourselves out of the hole that the previous Labor government got us into, if we are going to afford the things we need to do in the future—things such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and everyone in this parliament talks about how wonderful it is but no one has thought about how we will pay for it all, in full—we need to encourage the entrepreneurs of this nation. We need to encourage them to get out there and take those risks, to expand and to experiment. We want them to get out there and have a crack at those export markets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is exactly what this bill does. It opens up the Export Financial Insurance Corporation to enable it to loan for both capital and non-capital goods. Although it is only a small step, it is part of a suite of measures we are making to provide that hopeful and rewarding opportunity to the business people of Australia. They are the ones who create the wealth of this nation and that is what enables us to provide all those valuable social programs. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this export finance and insurance corporation bill, as I believe it will provide benefits to small and medium businesses right around Australia. Members will be aware of my passion for micro and small business. Before entering parliament I ran my own small business for 10 years, so I understand the challenges that small-business owners face. Since entering parliament I have spent a great deal of my time talking to the small-business operators in my electorate of Canberra and advocating for their needs and interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses are the engine room of our economy and we need to develop the policy environment for them to thrive. Small businesses employ more than five million Australians and contribute almost 50 per cent of private-sector employment. That is why I am particularly pleased with the number of amendments that are in this bill on that front. By broadening Efic's ability to lend in all-goods export transactions, not only capital-goods transactions, there is the potential to see this country's export potential grow significantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is a statutory body that offers trade finance and insurance services to support Australian exporters. The export credit agency operates on a commercial basis and partners with businesses and banks to provide finances to SMEs that are exporters, companies in an export supply chain, companies looking to expand their business overseas and companies operating in emerging and frontier markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Efic provides financial services to companies that have been unable to secure adequate finance from the private sector. It fills a gap in the market. It provides SMEs with an opportunity, a chance that conservative Australian banks just cannot do. It will often take a risk on an SME where a bank would not. This kind of risk is crucial in getting SMEs off the ground and ultimately helps lead to innovation in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's record with the Export Finance Insurance Corporation goes back to its establishment. In 1991, the Hawke Labor government passed the original Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill to re-establish the Efic known as the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This original bill established the Efic as an independent statutory corporation separate from Austrade, offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters. It is pleasing to see that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation still operates today under the minister's statement of expectations issued by Labor's former minister for trade, Dr Craig Emerson.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of amendments in this act which will help Australian businesses flourish and I support them wholeheartedly. This bill gives Efic the ability to lend in all goods export transactions not only capital goods transactions, as I said before. This will expand Efic's capacity to support Australian businesses, particularly SMEs, as the vast majority of Australian exporters are not capital goods. To implement this measure, it requires deleting the word 'capital' from the definition of an eligible export transaction in the Efic act. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only five per cent of Australian exports are actually capital goods yet under the current Efic Act, Efic can lend directly in support of capital goods but not all goods. This means Efic cannot lend for exports for many of the products for which Australia is famous—that is, goods like food and wine. It can, however, support the export of cows but not milk. From a business point of view, this just does not make sense. As I mentioned earlier, allowing Efic to lend for the other 95 per cent of exports significantly improves Australia's export potential. This is particularly good for small business, particularly good for jobs and particularly good for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second substantial amendment effected by this bill is the widening of the competitive neutrality provisions as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Currently such provisions only apply to short-term insurance contracts. This is outdated as Efic now lists only medium-sized insurance as a product. In its 2012 inquiry report, the Productivity Commission recommended that Efic should pay a tax equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee in order to ensure that the Efic's activity on the commercial account complies with competitive neutrality arrangements. This bill implements this recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes measures that make it easier for Australian businesses to export their goods internationally and that is why we welcome this bill. Labor is committed to expanding Australia's international trade opportunities to generate jobs and growth for the future and this bill is consistent with that objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch briefly on my experience of Efic. In my former life I worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a diplomat. I worked on the Middle East desk couple of years. During that time, I worked on Iran and was involved in the normalisation of the relationship with Iran. I commend Tim Fischer, who actually drove the change to that policy. It was a significant change to our policy. We had diplomatic relationships with Iran and had not severed those after 1980, but the relationship was not terribly strong. There had been no exchanges, no business trips, no ministerial visits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tim Fischer saw the opportunities that Iran offered, particularly for sugar exporters and for a range of other resources in addition to just services and products. I was involved first up in the normalisation of the relationship and, secondly, in the first ministerial visit to Iran in 10 years. Tim Fischer was the minister at the time and led a business delegation to Tehran. As I said, there was a broad range of people that were involved in that delegation. There were people from BHP, there were people from CSR Sugar. We had people who wanted to export tiles into Iran and people who were looking at exporting gems into Iran. A very broad range of potential exporters took part in that delegation. It was a historic delegation. It was a significant delegation and Efic was there alongside these potential exporters to identify potential opportunities for them to engage in trade with Iran.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The beauty about Efic, too, was the fact that because they understand government and work closely with them they were involved in the discussion that I was also involved in, which was led by BHP, where we engaged in a negotiation on a banking and finance agreement with Iran. They were involved in those discussions. They took about two days to get going and to finalise. Again, it was a major outcome of that visit—not just the symbolic gesture that was shown by actually having a minister there for the first time in 10 years but also the fact that we had this significant business delegation and produced a range of agreements, most importantly, this banking and finance agreement, which in a way provided the framework for exporters to engage in trade and export opportunities with Iran for the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the relationship with Iran, the environment was very different from what it is today. At that stage Khatami had just been elected and Iran was looking to engage in greater liberalisation and was also opening up to the world. There are gestures being shown at the moment that they are also keen to engage more openly with the rest of the world and, in a way, liberalise. But at that stage there was this real sense of energy and momentum for change and a real will for change in that country. It was completely appropriate for the then minister, Tim Fischer, to have a vision for what the relationship could be with Iran at that stage, to engage in that ministerial visit, to take that business delegation to Iran and to engage in negotiating those agreements. It was a very different environment to what we see at the moment, but I do once again applaud the former minister for actually having the vision for that relationship and realising it through that ministerial visit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor especially welcomes measures that benefit small businesses and I personally welcome these measures. As I said to you before, prior to this life I was a diplomat and then after that I had my own small business for 10 years, which was a wonderful experience. I am always looking for mechanisms to improve opportunities for small business and particularly to provide the right policy settings for businesses, both micro and small and medium, to thrive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to sing the praises of a number of Canberra businesses which have achieved great things on the export front. In October the ACT Chief Minister held her export awards and a number of businesses won those awards. Some of them you know. Aspen Medical—we all know of Aspen Medical—have just won the Ebola contract. That business went from being a kitchen table business 10 to 12 years ago to being an absolute multinational, international civilian and military outfit that is winning awards all over Australia and contracts all over the world. They are a class outfit. Glenn Keys and his team do an extraordinary job. They are based in my electorate here in Canberra and, as I said, they are exporting to the world. Every time I see Glenn he has another clutch of awards under his arm that he has won. He is an extraordinary individual with a great vision and he is always a great contributor to the Canberra community. So it is not surprising that, once again, Aspen Medical won the health and biotechnology award.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to sing the praises of another company—that is, Canberra-based technology company Seeing Machines. They were crowned ACT Exporter of the Year. Again, this is an extraordinary company. In Canberra we have these very specialised businesses that usually provide services, but they have a real cutting edge and they really do us proud. Seeing Machines develops state-of-the-art fatigue and distraction monitoring technology. They developed the driver safety system, which is already being used by mining, commercial road transport and automotive industries worldwide. The company was founded in 1999. It now has 95 employees across Canberra, San Francisco, Arizona and Tuscany, with export sales accounting for 53 per cent of its revenue. It was recognised as Exporter of the Year just a month after the company announced a collaboration deal with Samsung that aims to bring face- and eye-tracking technology to the consumer electronics market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make mention of another company, Intelledox, who have also done some great work in terms of linking up with South Asia and also exporting to Singapore. They are an outfit that recently made a significant donation to the ANU. They digitalise processes through mobile-ready smart web forms. They are involved in document automation, data transformation and business integration. They are essentially a data management outfit that have done some great work here in Canberra in the Public Service and right across Australia, and now they are exporting to Singapore. They were founded in 1992 and they are headquartered here and have offices in Singapore, New York, London and Toronto, as well as global partners throughout the world. They have been awarded Telstra ACT Business of the Year, they were listed on <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthill Magazine's</span> 2013 Smart 100 list and they were named a BRW Fast 100 company in 2010 and 2011. Again, they are another class outfit from Canberra that is exporting to the world with particularly creative and innovative solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to touch on Labor's record on small business, because it is a very good one and it is a very proud one. We supported and established a range of programs to assist small businesses to expand their trade and export opportunities. The Export Market Development Grants scheme is a terrific example of this. The scheme provides assistance to aspiring and current exporters, and the grants are a key measure in supporting Australia's small and medium-sized business who want to develop export markets. As I said, as a former small business owner myself, I know that deciding to export involves a great deal of risk—it is a real leap of faith. The research, promotion and travel required to identify the markets and build the relationships to begin exporting is incredibly costly. This scheme reimburses a significant amount of eligible export promotion expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, as we know, also increased the small business instant asset write-off threshold from $1,000 to $6,500. In our 2012 budget, we announced that we would provide tax relief for business by allowing them to carry back tax losses of up to $1 million so they could receive a refund against tax already paid. And it was Labor that commissioned the first Small Business Commissioner in this country. Labor is committed to expanding Australia's international trading opportunities to generate jobs and growth for the future, and this bill is consistent with that objective.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249758" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  It has been pleasing to hear the member for Hughes initially, and just then my good colleague the member for Canberra, talk about the important role that Efic plays and the gap in the market that it fills. This is where government certainly does have a role. Even more pleasing to hear was the number of companies that the member for Canberra referred to that are exporting their goods and services around the world—in particular, a couple of very successful medical companies. This is where this country needs to go with greater exports and more companies creating more employment, significantly, for our country. It is these exporters that are taking advantage of some of the fastest growing markets around the world. It is so important that we help them flourish and encourage them along their journey. Sometimes their journey can be tough, and that is where a body like Efic comes into play and has an important role. From my own experiences working in trade and investment overseas in Europe, when we were trying to assist some SMEs to get into new markets they did need some assistance from specialists in the field—not that I was the only specialist. There were others, whether it be Austrade or other Australian businessmen already located there, who were able to pass on their expertise and advice to help them enter those markets. Often it is the SMEs too, and this is where Efic really has a significant role to play where the banks are not willing to finance some of their operations. SMEs are the engine room of our economy. They are so important to growing our markets and taking advantage of the opportunities overseas. In terms of those opportunities overseas, I will speak a bit later about the free trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A classic in terms of SMEs is the South Australian economy, where around 98 per cent of all enterprises operating are SMEs, and around 90 per cent of those employ fewer than 19 people. When you think about it, these are real microbusinesses, but they are so important in the fabric of our economy. On the weekend I was promoting the Shop Small campaign, which I think is a good initiative. I went around to a few local businesses in Torrensville—the Master of Bread bakery, who were very hospitable and offered some of their fine products, as well as the Little Canton restaurant. At both places the operators are very passionate, dedicated businesspeople who are having a real crack and hoping to make a go. The Little Canton restaurant has been there for a number of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the hard work required, these businesses take risks. They put their houses on the line. We as a government—and all governments for that matter, whether they be state or federal—need to do what we can to assist them to create the best environment. That is why such a measure is important. It broadens the scope for a body like Efic to provide financing. As we have heard before in this place, it reduces regulation and red tape—over $2 billion of savings—which, combined with the repeal of the carbon tax, is giving small businesses a great start to get on and do what they do best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a common-sense reform to broaden the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's capacity—we have backed this, and I was pleased to hear that Labor are also supporting it in terms of the merits of the bill—because it prioritises an area that can be improved to help the export potential of SMEs, and it allows Efic to focus on helping small and medium-sized Australian companies to seize the opportunities. The main area where it does this is through lending directly to exporters of non-capital goods. The Minister for Small Business, the Minister for Trade and Investment and the Minister for Agriculture—the three combined—must be congratulated for driving some of these changes through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to these changes, Efic could only lend directly for the export of capital goods that are used in the production of other goods and not an end product. What do we mean by this? As some of my colleagues have pointed out, a classic anomaly is in the area of dairy, which is a significantly growing area for the Australian agricultural sector. We have seen how dairy has been such a boon for the New Zealand economy, with it quadrupling in recent years. This change in the legislation means that Efic can apply both to cows and to milk. This goes broader than just that one example, obviously. This restriction had applied to all other goods, including pharmaceuticals, food and fibre, medical products and consumer goods such as wine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these instances Efic provides a financial guarantee to the bank, which will then do the actual lending. It was clear that there was a need to extend the ability of Efic to lend to enterprises that export non-capital goods and not confine them to just a credit guarantee, which at the end of the day equated to extra costs. Again I say that this is a common-sense reform that directly benefits the Australian economy and SMEs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the free trade agreements, the recent Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement means that beef exporters will no longer have to pay $70 for a certificate of origin for each shipment. It also means that 97 per cent of our exports to Japan get preferential or duty-free access. These are just a couple of examples. When combined with what we are doing with China and South Korea, there are significant opportunities for our exporters and our SMEs to take advantage of some great foundations and some areas of growth in the economy that can help grow prosperity and, importantly, jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard many stories in my electorate where businesses have found it increasingly difficult to do business. We are making it easier. We are fostering a better environment and letting business get on with what they do best. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. I agree with what the member for Hindmarsh said about the importance of Efic to our economy and to our businesses. I want to commend the member for Canberra for a characteristically interesting speech about her time working in small business and also working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original Efic bill was a proud legacy of the Hawke government in 1991. In that bill, they did build on the corporation which is an independent statutory corporation that is separate from Austrade, offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters. Its purpose is to assist Australian companies, as the member for Hindmarsh said, and enable them to win business, to grow internationally and to achieve export success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our export credit agency, the corporation operates on a commercial basis and partners with banks to provide financial solutions for businesses that are exporters, Australian companies with export supply chain and Australian companies operating in emerging and frontier markets. They are all very important aspirations. In performing that role, as others have said when they spoke before me, it does give our companies the leg up that some need in the financial world in order to compete. That is particularly in our own region of Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that Labor is supporting the bill before the parliament today is because there are changes that can be made to make sure that Efic keeps up with changes in the composition of our exports and other changes. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that only five per cent of our exports right now are capital goods. Members would be aware that Efic, as it stands, can only directly assist capital exporters. That does exclude 95 per cent of our exporters, who are people who want to do business in Asia and beyond and who want to export things like wine and products that are not necessarily the capital goods—so that 95 per cent of our export composition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to make sure that our trade arrangements—Efic and also our broader trade arrangements—keep up with the changes in our economy and the changes in the global economy. This bill certainly does that. The other problem with Efic as it stands that the bill seeks to rectify is that it does lock out from direct assistance a lot of the small and medium enterprises that we do want to be encouraging in our economy. It is important this bill fixes that problem up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Canberra mentioned, on this side of the House we do have are proud record of supporting small business. We had in government things like a variety of tax concessions for the two million small businesses, who employ something like five million Australians; we had the tax-loss carry back; we had the instant asset write-off and we had the special depreciation rules for motor vehicles. Unfortunately, these have been scrapped by those opposite. That is an unfortunate development for small businesses in particular. We do want those small businesses and medium businesses to be able to access Efic finance, which is what this bill is all about today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the bill itself, it will create amendments to that original Efic act from the Hawke government in 1991. It will give Efic the ability to lend, as I said, in all goods export transactions, not just capital goods transactions. In that way, the most substantial change that the amendment to the act makes is to remove capital from capital goods and the definition of eligible export transactions and make all the consequential amendments that flow from that. It allows direct lending to those exporters of goods, not just capital goods.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other speakers have mentioned that as it stands right now if you are excluded from direct Efic assistance on the basis that you are a goods exporter and not a capital goods exporter, you previously or until now had to go through all sorts of rigmarole to tee up guarantees and all sorts of arrangements in order to access some assistance. That would be a burden for SMEs in our economy. It is important that they are now eligible for direct assistance after the passage of this bill. As I said before, that brings those other 95 per cent of exporters into the net of people who can be assisted by Efic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the changes. We did have some more ambitious changes on the table when the government changed. Those have now lapsed unfortunately. We did have slightly higher horizons for changes to Efic but in the absence of those, which have lapsed, disappointingly, we do support the changes brought forward by the government for a lot of the reasons that the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Canberra mentioned earlier. In the absence of those three tax concession measures that were dumped by the current government but that existed under the previous government, we are looking for any way we can to help small- and medium-size businesses compete, particularly in our export markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we hope to see as a consequence of the passage of this bill is more businesses benefiting from the good work that Efic does. We want to see more small- and medium-sized enterprises prosper from that good work and we want to make sure that Australian businesses, not just big businesses and not just exporters of capital goods but all of Australian businesses, can benefit from Efic we want to see them eligible, we want to see them competing and we want to see them succeeding.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUTCHINSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I join the member for Rankin and in acknowledging that I too enjoyed the member for Canberra's contribution to this debate on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and her experience that she has had in this area of trade and, indeed, in small businesses. To be brutally honest, to look at the track record of the previous government in terms of small business, it is rather disingenuous when you consider that during six years they had five ministers for small business, start-ups of small businesses in Australia fell through the floor and small business failures under the previous administration increased enormously. Why? Because the burden and the costs on small businesses were going up. The regulatory burden was going up. Taxes were going up. The things that we said when we came to government were indeed about trying to reduce that regulatory burden, trying to reduce the cost of particularly taxes. We have removed the carbon tax, which, most small business in this country were simply unable to pass on. They were not considered as export exposed industries and this hurt enormously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the comments in respect of this Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 before the House, particularly around the notion of competitive neutrality. It is indeed important because this is a government participating in a space where there is other competition. But it has been acknowledged on both sides that it is very worthwhile work that work Efic does. I have had experience of this myself. It is important that that competitive neutrality is indeed adhered to. I acknowledge that part of the changes that are being moved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is indeed an exporting nation and $300 billion worth of goods were exported out of this country. We should be doing as a government everything we can to help businesses to help themselves. That is indeed what these amendments are intended to do. They are designed to suit support small businesses, medium enterprises and larger businesses as well to do what they do best—that is, get on with business, create markets, explore markets and open markets. Sometimes they need some assistance in funding those opportunities or, as has been mentioned, getting insurance with certain customers, which of course comes at a cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of my experiences in a previous life within the wool textile industry. I worked for an exporting business in Melbourne. Efic enabled businesses. We had internal provisions around who and who we could not deal with. Without being able to access Efic insurance cover, we would not have been able to do business with many of the customers that were indeed good customers. That was a cost of doing business. It was the cost of risk. But once that Efic insurance cover is approved and once that Efic finance facility is in place it is, indeed, bankable. It is something that you can take to your bank and use as collateral, which then allows you to expand your business. Certainly within the wool-exporting business in this country, access to capital is indeed an enormous challenge from time to time. As has been mentioned, it just simply did not make sense that in this country the five per cent of goods that were eligible for finance under the Efic scheme were capital goods and 95 per cent were something other than capital goods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes made within this bill to reflect the reality of the situation will benefit us enormously. As the member for Canberra mentioned, we could previously get cover for cows but not milk. It does not make any sense at all. These are practical changes that we have seen within this bill. I think of some of the exporters in my home state and indeed in my electorate, meat exporters in the form of JBS Australia, which are based in Longford. I think of the 2013 Regional Exporter of the Year, Tasmanian Quality Meats, which are based in Cressy, also within my electorate. They are currently growing that business enormously. As I said, they were the Australian Regional Exporter of the Year. They particularly have a focus at the moment on the Middle East but I know they have plans, particularly off the back of some of the free trade agreements that we have been able to secure as government since coming to power in 2013. There are opportunities that exist for their business to grow, with the appropriate accreditation and the like, but to grow the opportunities that present in places such as China are, indeed, enormous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think also of the seafood exporters, the well-known salmon producers that, as I say, are very much part of the Tasmanian brand. Huon Aquaculture; Tassal and Petuna Seafoods all have operations of some kind or another within my electorate. I think of some of the more innovative seafood businesses, such as Seafoods Tasmania, in dealing with what is a consequence of international trade in terms of sea urchins that are now, unfortunately, very prevalent off the east coast of Tasmania. There have been numerous efforts to find ways of dealing with this invasive species, all of which have failed. It has now turned into a commercial opportunity. The work that Seafoods Tasmania do at Goshen, a small town just north of St Helens in my electorate, involves harvesting those sea urchins. Those of you who enjoy sushi will know this as izumi if you are in Japan. The work that they are doing there to turn that into an export product, both into China, Hong Kong, Singapore and also Japan is tremendous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year one of the recipients of support from Efic was a Tasmania-based shipbuilding company, Incat. They make outstanding catamarans that sail all around the world. They receive some Efic support to fund a liquid natural gas powered ferry, the first in the world. This is outstanding work. Another business in the north-west of the state, Specialised Vehicle Solutions, have also received support from Efic in the past 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exporting is not an easy business. I go back to my former life within the wool industry. Many of the retail businesses around get paid in cash and that is wonderful. But very rarely in the business I was involved in did you ever see cash. It was done on terms; it would be for 30 days if you were really, really lucky. More often than not, it was done on 90 day terms. I remember back in the late eighties, and some might say the heady days of the wool industry, it was a common practice to have terms when doing business in the Soviet Union—as it was at the time—of 180 days, and in some cases 360 days. The notion of cash and therefore the capacity to be able to fund exports and business, is indeed a challenge—particularly, for smaller businesses that are growing and finding their way. There is no question that this is a real challenge for many of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are businesses indeed. I note the member for Hughes's contribution in this debate. These people are indeed the wealth creators of our nation, and we should be doing everything we can to support them. It is through the work that they do, the people they employ and the taxes they ultimately pay that allows this nation is able to—if we manage the books properly—pay for the services that the people of Australia rightly expect their government to provide. It is not a magic pudding though and therefore governments should—like households and small businesses—learn to live within their means. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is unfortunately and tragically the great failure of the six years that we had under the previous Labor government. They simply could not live within their means. This is the legacy that we have inherited; this is the challenge that we are dealing with. Yes, some of the decisions that we have been asked to make have been difficult decisions—nobody disputes that for one second—but they are challenges that we are up for. They are challenges that the people of Australia truly expect us to get on with. This is our lot in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome these changes. An additional $200 million of capital is, indeed, timely. Taking a look at the role of Efic, I remind all who may take an interest in this space, it is competing in an area where there are other providers of these services; we should always remember that. The competitive neutrality is acknowledged within the changes in this bill. We should always be mindful—and that process should be reviewed from time to time—that we are not getting into a space where the private sector and others can provide these services appropriately. But, as it stands at the moment, we fully support the work that Efic does and the roles that they play to support, capitalise, fund and provide opportunities for small, medium and large businesses in this country selling Australian produce around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes around increasing this to include non-capital goods is common sense. Our job is to also communicate that to businesses that are looking to expand their operations. Part of the role that we play as parliamentarians is to make sure that businesses that are looking to grow their business, create more jobs and export products out of this country are aware of the opportunities that they have under the Efic Corporation. Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in this debate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  I rise today to speak on the coalition government's continued commitment to small and medium businesses in Australia, as evidenced by the intent of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. While this coalition government continues to make great progress in the freeing up of markets under our trade agreement framework, which has seen many new markets opened up for Australian businesses, there still needs to be more in the way of support for business to truly expand internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the role of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic. They have been doing a good job of helping exporters to secure finance, insurance, risk assessments and the advice that they need. However, direct lending has only been available to those exporters who compete in the capital goods markets. To understand why this is such a problem, we need to define what is a capital good. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Oxford English Dictionary</span> defines capital goods as 'goods that are used in producing other goods, rather than being bought by consumers'. That is straightforward enough but very limiting, as Australia does not produce many capital goods. This can create some confusion. As colleagues have said before me, if a cow is exported to be a producer of milk, but not meat, it can be considered a capital good. However, cattle exported for meat are considered a consumer good. That is why the amendments proposed in this bill are so important for businesses who deal in consumer goods, those goods bought by the end consumer, not by producers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us consider an example. If Poppy's Chocolate, based in the member for Forde's electorate, were to export machinery for making chocolate to Japan, they would be able to access direct funding for this venture. However, if they wanted to sell their primary product—that is, the eating chocolate—to Japan, they would not qualify for direct funding from Efic. While I am all for businesses diversifying and innovating, this should not be at the cost of their primary business. Why should we not support those businesses selling consumer goods to expand their operations to take advantage of the many new trade agreements negotiated by the coalition government? Australia produces some fine consumer goods, and the rest of the world clamours for them in certain markets. Not that many years ago, there was in fact a Vegemite shortage in Japan. Tim Tams gained a cult following in the USA following the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Asia has an insatiable appetite for ice cream that Australian producers could help fill if they could just get their goods into those markets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we understand that business occasionally needs a helping hand in order to expand. I was disappointed that the member for Rankin claimed that Labor had 'higher horizons' for Efic and wanted to help Efic, yet, when the member for Rankin was part of the then Labor Treasurer's team, they produced a shameful record with Efic. Labor gutted Efic, ripping $200 million of equity out of Efic as a one-off special dividend in the 2012 budget when they were indulging in a desperate search for their delusional surplus, scratching down the back of the couch looking for the loose change to try to prop up the surplus they claimed several times but never delivered. In its 2013 annual report, Efic noted that this caused 'material breaches' of prudential guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has reversed that raid on Efic's capital base, restoring $200 million of new equity capital to Efic in the 2014 budget. Once again, the coalition are demonstrating our genuine support for small business and small business exporters. Larger businesses mean more employees, which means fewer people out of work and a broader tax base—or, to put it simply for those opposite: less outgoings and more incomings for the government to pay for health, education, roads and infrastructure without needing to continually increase the limit on the nation's credit card. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government understand how business works. We do not see business as a milch cow, an unlimited supply of money to be taxed. We understand the drive, ambition and dedication it takes to put your house on the line to fund your dream. We appreciate that business owners are usually the last ones paid if there is anything left over after they have paid their employees and their creditors. So we are offering them a hand up, with a simple change to the goods that qualify for direct funding from Efic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Labor would prefer we did not give business a helping hand because that is not what they do. Rather than support businesses to build a stronger economy, they would tax them to the point of breaking. But the coalition is a government that fosters trade and supports local companies to take advantage of the opportunities the many new and upcoming trade agreements will bring to Australian businesses. The coalition government is here to help. With this change, thousands of small and medium enterprises will be able to take on the world. Surely, that is a goal worth pursuing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the people of Australia are faced with a stark contrast: a coalition that fosters business and creates jobs and growth or the antithesis of our beliefs, the 'tear business down' mentality of Labor. This bill makes a small but very meaningful change to the operation of Efic, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

It introduced a huge number of small business-unfriendly acts such as expanding the reach of the so-called unfair dismissal laws. It also introduced the carbon tax, which had a deleterious impact across a whole range of small and medium exporters. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I go back to the bill. Currently, the Efic Act only allows for the lending of money to support the export of capital goods. Capital goods are defined as goods which are used to produce other goods, rather than an end product. They include machinery and goods used to manufacture end products. Capital goods currently make up only five per cent of Australia's exports, and some suggest that capital goods producers may be better placed to fund their own export endeavours than those seeking to export non-capital goods. Non-capital goods, on the other hand, are end products or consumer goods. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, when an exporter requires funds for the export of non-capital goods, Efic cannot lend to them directly but can facilitate a loan by providing a guarantee to the exporter's bank. This often results in duplication of paperwork, multiple or increased fees and extended loan-processing times. Small- to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are the main producers of non-capital goods and thus bear the brunt of these inefficiencies and extra costs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small to medium enterprises, by definition, are businesses employing less than100 people or with a turnover of less than $100 million. They make up the majority of the enterprises in my electorate of O'Connor. This bill, when passed, will permit Efic to lend directly to small to medium enterprises and will allow SMEs to capitalise on global trade opportunities. For the primary producers of my electorate of O'Connor, these legislative changes will have a significant impact. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Non-capital, or consumer goods, are largely the realm of rural and regional areas. These include beef, sheep meat, livestock, fibre, horticulture, wine, grains, flour, milk and dairy produce. These primary producers are usually SMEs who are often most hampered in their efforts to secure export finance through conventional lenders like the banks. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banks are traditionally dependent upon security, which is often lacking in export contracts, particularly for first-time exporters or for those exporting to emerging markets. Many of my constituents relay stories of waiting times of over a year to have bank finance approved or, worse still, to have their finance knocked back. Many have received sound and helpful advice from Efic and welcome the opportunity these amendments will afford them to engage directly with Efic for the financial support of their export endeavours. This amendment bill, when passed, will enable Efic to lend for the other 95 per cent of exported goods and therefore improve SME export potential and advance regional and rural economies. </span>

Truffle Producers of Western Australia's Chairman, Mark Horwood, maintains our WA product is lauded in Europe but the industry has so far been unable to crack the Chinese market.

AMF are an innovative SME in the Great Southern region of WA. They produce high-performance, non-toxic fertilisers through the blending of essential minerals and specially coated soil microbes to create powerful 'living' fertilisers for both the domestic and export markets. AMF ultimately secured bank finance through a long and frustrating process, complicated by the low value of their landholding in Tenterden as security and the uncertainty of the emerging markets that they sought to export into; yet their product is non-toxic, is certified organic and fetches a premium in an increasingly environmentally conscious consumer market. Surely, these are the sorts of producers we should be supporting.

Bruce Billson, on a tour of Kalgoorlie drilling component manufacturer Harlsan Industries. Brothers and co-owners Harley and Dean Hollier received advice from Efic which assisted them in securing independent funding for the export of their RC drilling equipment.

Efic's 'capability based' approach supports loans based on an exporter's ability to meet their contract, rather than the traditional bank approach to lending to SMEs with the most tangible security. It therefore currently supports enterprises that can demonstrate the best business practice in the export of their capital goods. Expanding this approach to the producers of non-capital goods will only enhance the potential of SMEs to export our premium primary produce to the world.</span>

                    </a>  Recently, Efic assisted Wellard to facilitate the export of 2,000 quality dairy cattle to Sri Lanka as part of their commitment to help establish a 22,500-head high-production dairy herd in that country. To fulfil the initial contract, Wellard was required to arrange finance for the buyer. Sri Lanka was still dealing with the aftermath of civil war and found themselves with limited access to foreign capital. Given the general unwillingness of the private sector to fund exports into some emerging frontier markets, Efic stepped in to provide a guarantee to an international bank to provide a loan or buyer finance to the Sri Lankan government. The success of this first contract has led Wellard to winning more substantial contracts in Sri Lanka. Wellard similarly maintain, and I quote from a recent personal communication:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, if I may digress for a moment to recount my own personal experience with Efic, as a young farmer I had a considerable amount of income exposed to an Iraqi wheat debt incurred from the sale of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board to Iraq on credit terms over the period 1988-90. Efic agreed to insure between 70 and 80 per cent of any payment default on these wheat exports to Iraq, with the Australian Wheat Board bearing the remaining exposure. Following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent imposition of United Nations economic sanctions, Iraq defaulted on payments. Efic subsequently paid credit insurance claims. After the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, the international community decided to support Iraq's economic recovery. ln November 2004, the Paris Club of creditors agreed to provide Iraq with 80 per cent debt forgiveness. The remaining debt stock is scheduled to be repaid over the 17 years from 2011. To date, Iraq has paid all principal and interest instalments in full and on time. Efic receives these repayments from Iraq semi-annually, and passes the wheat growers' portion to Agrium Asia Pacific, or APPI, which now owns the Australian Wheat Board's assets. APPI then distributes the proceeds to the Australian farmers. Overall, wheat farmers are likely to recover about 84 per cent of the original contract value, comprising the Efic claim payment of around 80 per cent and the Paris Club recovery of 20 per cent of the remaining uninsured exposure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Efic is managing this process with Iraq to ensure that Australian wheat farmers like me will receive their entitled share of repayments. I make note that Efic no longer provides short-term trade credit insurance, having sold this aspect of the business to the private sector in 2003. I thank the House for indulging me in recounting my personal story and use it to reiterate that Efic has already played an important role in maximising Australia's trade potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in this amendment bill will expand upon and enhance the ability of Efic to ensure that no Australian enterprise whether they produce a capital product, such as a piece of mining or manufacturing equipment, or a non-capital good, such as O'Connor's renowned primary produce, will be denied the opportunity to grow their business overseas simply because they are unable to access finance. These new direct lending arrangements will remove the need for exporters of non-capital goods to obtain a guarantee from Efic before they can secure funds from a bank. This doubled the due diligence processing time and required duplication of documentation and considerable additional legal fees. This will become a real benefit to all exporters by reducing the time and paperwork required to access Efic support. This will ensure that Efic is able to provide products and services that will match the evolving needs of modern businesses.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and thank the House for this opportunity. The bill will create amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 and by doing so will vastly improve the commercial opportunities of the many Australian export businesses right around the country. Today's bill is another piece of important legislation that has been analysed, reviewed and amended by this side of government. This legislation is crucial and an ongoing part of the coalition's plan to revive Australian's small- to medium-size enterprises, which employ the largest number of employees and make up the bulk of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunity to speak on this bill today has coincided perfectly with the freshly inked trade agreements which have concluded with China, Korea and Japan. Existing tariffs on many popular exports such as agriculture, horticulture and seafood will phase out in the next few years, meaning billions of dollars can be added to our economy. In light of this historic agreement we must not let existing legislation hinder business opportunities and instead work in combination to achieve the optimum result for our export enterprises. Both the bill and the respective trade agreements will allow prospects of export trading with these countries to flourish. The timing could not have been better, and I am certain that many export businesses, from the traditional agriculture sector to retail goods, are breathing a sigh of relief knowing their future is viable under the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's bill enhances the capacity of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to back small- and medium-size businesses seeking to capitalise on opportunities for global trade. As our nation and our government supports and encourages entrepreneurs, we must do all that we can to ensure opportunities that are presented to businesses can be seized and accomplished without unnecessary obstacles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Globalised and increasingly integrated trading means businesses often look beyond state borders to seek and relish new commercial opportunities. This could be a combination offering a niche product with domestic expertise that is best suited to other markets or a multinational cooperative with other communities that can benefit from our products or services. Whatever the reason may be, this government fully stands behind the plethora of aspiring entrepreneurs and businesses that want to create and compete. Furthermore, whenever prospects arise for such businesses to export their goods and services, our policies should allow for employment and growth opportunities, as these flow directly back into the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a small nation, but the goods and services that we provide are second to none, and these are not just limited to the resources sector. Australia's wide range of consumer goods, including pharmaceuticals, beef, sheep meat, livestock, horticulture products, wine, flour, fibre and cheese, coupled with increased international exposure from trade shows and tourism, means people are becoming increasingly aware of the exceptional quality and thus demand for these items. Statistics show that within the last two financial years there was an increase from 44,000 exports of goods and services to over 45,000. Whilst the biggest contributor of exported goods is still the mining sector, general use of service exporters is on the rise. It would be a real shame for Australian businesses to lose precious commercial opportunities to export our goods due to a lack of finance, excessive red tape and bureaucracy. The coalition has always been committed to strengthening the opportunities to support our small and medium-sized businesses, and this legislation today provides a vital pathway for that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation plays a crucial role in assisting export business ventures, stepping in to provide insurance and financial backing where traditional lenders have declined assistance. Efic was established as Australia's credit agency and operates commercially, partnering with the banks to provide financial solutions to various Australian small and medium-sized exporters, and has been essential in helping exporters take advantage of potential contract opportunities that might otherwise have been impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important not to underestimate how much Australian exporters contribute to our economy and to our GDP. Exports are worth approximately $1 out of every $5 in Australia's national income. The International Monetary Fund has previously stated in its World Economic Outlook that Australia's export volumes will continue to fuel our economy and potentially taper the negative effects of a downturn in mining investments. Since the global financial crisis, the general slump of economies and their interdependence means that we must allow policies to provide businesses the resilience to withstand change. While some industries are subject to cyclical change and subdued growth, others may experience growth and expansion. Nevertheless, none should have to suffer from unnecessary red tape and bureaucratic burden where none is needed. Enhanced efficiencies in various competitive export sectors can significantly increase sales potential and renew further investment in the Australian economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that changes to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in terms of direct lending will help overcome some of the barriers exporters face. Currently, many Australian products that we excel in, such as those previously mentioned—pharmaceuticals, beef, sheep meat, livestock, horticultural products, wine, flour, fibres and cheese—are not considered capital goods, as they are classified as consumer goods. Yet the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation can only lend to exporters of capital goods. In reality, however, capital goods make up a mere five per cent of all Australian goods exported. So, whilst the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation can directly lend for exporting dairy cows, it cannot directly lend to those wishing to export milk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, exporters of non-capital goods have traditionally had to obtain a guarantee from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation before securing funds from a bank, meaning additional time is spent on paperwork before any transaction actually occurs. In these scenarios, Efic provides a financial guarantee to the bank at the request of the exporter, and the bank then directly lends the finances. The application to Efic, as well as to the bank, means two separate lots of credit approvals, associated documentation, administration and legal fees. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is committed to ensuring new direct lending arrangements that will remove the current restrictions in place for Australian exporters and the excessive red tape. When business compliance costs amount to approximately $1 billion per annum, this measure is vital to restoring faith to our regional, rural and general exporting sector. Mr Deputy Speaker Porter, you can imagine the potential monetary loss to the economy and to businesses. Changes to the Efic legislation will ensure regional and rural economies can thrive, with demand from emerging and developed international markets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, the measure contained in this legislation supports our election commitment to helping Australian businesses by a reduction in compliance costs. Time and again, small businesses right around Australia speak of the compliance costs which make and break their enterprises, and we owe it to them to provide the right framework that would cultivate ongoing opportunities. Enabling Efic to facilitate more financial options for Australian exporters is an important start. Expanding the scope and power of Efic is not targeted at marginalising private sector contributions; rather, it is about helping commercially viable exporters overcome financial obstacles that would otherwise prevent them from reaching overseas markets. The coalition have always been the party that stood for encouraging and nurturing current and future entrepreneurs, and we believe the change proposed today is essential to building a stronger and successful economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's positive reforms follow on from this government's earlier enhancement for SME exporters in the 2014-15 budget, where an injection of $200 million was granted to Efic. This injection was much needed after a prior raid by the opposition. Restoration of Efic's finances means it can focus on this objective of helping and supporting Australian exporters, especially the small- to medium-sized enterprises, which make up the engine room of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's bill is so important to Australian export businesses because its implementation will ultimately increase Australia's reputation and competitiveness on the international stage. A recent survey of Australian export businesses by the Export Council of Australia revealed that the majority of difficulties experienced by exporters were regulatory compliance and access to finance respectively. As smaller companies rely more on international revenue from developed and emerging markets, increased or difficult bureaucracies would simply render them unfeasible. The survey further revealed that the majority of businesses, regardless of size, engage in a variety of business operations not limited to outsourcing, foreign investment, production and research and development. Australian exports amounted to over $310 billion in recent years. This demonstrates the potential of Australian businesses and, more importantly, how much more potential there is with the right policies in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As global trends point to trade liberalisation, encouraging consumers, stakeholders and businesses working together, the government must ensure that export businesses have the right backing and support to enable them to reach their full potential. As I have discussed before, the rewards for businesses have a flow-on effect to our society, by employing Australians and contributing to our overall economy. With our two significant trade partnerships with Japan and China, we can now expect further growth and opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has always been at the forefront of backing entrepreneurs. Expanding Efic will allow businesses which need capital to tap into current and emerging markets and to do so without red tape and bureaucracy. This side of government fully believes in and supports our exporters whether they are rural, regional or metropolitan based businesses. Australia's range of consumer goods and services deserve international reach for its outstanding quality and a chance to present these on an international scale should be fostered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's bill is one step to forging a supportive path for exporters and continuing to strengthen our economy. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is often the vital link between small- to medium-sized enterprises through the provision of insurance and finance. By previously having their support limited to only those with capital goods, which is a mere five per cent of all Australian exports, it has seen some of Australian businesses simply unable to gain momentum or a foothold in emerging markets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's measure will ensure that all businesses can have the opportunity to expand into international markets by streamlining financial processes and alleviating unnecessary red tape. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBB</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I rise to sum up the government's case for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The government is firmly committed to reducing red tape. This bill achieves that goal. Amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act benefit small and medium sized businesses while at the same time reducing business compliance costs by $1 billion per annum. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic, helps ensure Australian small and medium sized businesses have access to the finance they need to grow their business overseas. As has been stated before, the goal of this bill is to increase Efic's capacity to finance small and medium sized businesses seeking to capitalise on global trade opportunities. These global trade opportunities benefit all and they are about to get a whole lot bigger with the commencement of free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and now China covering over 50 per cent of all exports from Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Efic plays an important role in supplementing the provision of credit for exporters and we are repositioning it to best support exporters into the future. Efic has played a very strong role over many decades and is the one financial body in Australia that has expertise in assessing the risk in small and developing nations in our region. It often provides important opportunities for exporters to get those opportunities when they would not get finance from other financial institutions. They fill the gap. They fill the financial gap that exists for these sorts of lending, especially to small and medium businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This builds on our restoration of $200 million in capital to Efic in the recent budget, reversing Labor's shameful act of economic vandalism when it ripped out a $200 million special dividend in 2013 and caused Efic to be placed into a position where they were not able to meet the prudential requirements that they had placed on themselves in order to act in a responsible manner. This was a highly irresponsible act and it gives the lie to a number of the contributions that we have heard from those opposite during this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Efic is currently only able to provide direct lending for the export of capital goods—items used in the production of other goods—but cannot directly lend for the export of goods themselves. For instance, this means that presently, as other speakers have noted, Efic can provide direct lending for the export of cows but not for the export of milk. Efic can provide direct lending for the export of bull semen, a capital good, but not a steer that is destined to be a hamburger. This is an oversight from the outset of Efic, which makes no sense and has had quite a costly consequence over time. This means that 95 per cent of goods exported from Australia are currently denied direct lending support from Efic, as only five per cent of Australian goods are capital goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To implement this measure in this bill we are simply removing one word—that is, 'capital'—from the definition of an eligible export transaction in the Efic Act. If you like, it is one very small step for Efic but one giant leap for our SME exporters. By allowing direct lending arrangements, exporters of non-capital goods will no longer need to go through a two-step process of first obtaining a guarantee from Efic and then finding a bank willing to lend against that guarantee. These outdated arrangements double the due diligence processing time for export credits and require two sets of documentation and legal fees. Through these changes, these duplicated processes will go—a reduction, a serious reduction, in red tape and costs. Business will no longer need to pay a bank a fee of up to three per cent simply to have the bank accept a AAA-rated Efic guarantee. These changes will save businesses time and money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also ensuring these changes do not bring Efic into direct competition with private sector financiers, by applying competitive neutrality principles. To achieve this, the bill provides for Efic to pay a debt neutrality charge and a tax-equivalent payment. This measure ensures competitive neutrality and reflects the recommendation on competitive neutrality in the 2012 Productivity Commission report on <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's export credit arrangements</span>. As stated, this bill expands Efic's powers to allow direct lending for export transactions involving all goods, not just capital goods, and provides for competitive neutrality principles to apply to Efic's operations. It is an important part of our efforts to reduce red tape. The bill helps to ensure that Australian small- and medium-sized businesses have access to the finance they need to grow their businesses overseas, which in turn supports job growth. It fits with our overarching theme of displacing big government from centre stage and replacing it with robust growth of the private sector.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I rise to speak on this condolence motion as perhaps the only member of the House of Representatives and also the Senate who served contemporaneously with Reg Withers. He was born in 1924. He served in the Australian Navy. He was a former lawyer and barrister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He entered the Senate in 1966 and served until 1987. He was a minister—Special Minister of State, Capital Territory, Media, and Tourism and Recreation, and Minister for Administrative Services. The circumstances under which he left the ministry were of some note, and I will come back to those. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He retired from politics in 1987 and was elected Lord Mayor of Perth in 1991 and served in that role until 1994. Mr Reg Withers was a very special sort of individual. When I look back at his background, there were some similarities to the Ruddocks. He may not have recognised that himself. The Ruddock family, when it looked at its war service, found that it was primarily in the Navy. He was a lawyer. The Ruddocks are lawyers. He served in public life over 20 years, and saw that as a very significant public duty. He continued to demonstrate that in the later tasks that he undertook. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember him being a character. That would be true. Sometimes he would take the micky out of you. He did that of me. Members may not recognise the character I am about to describe but in the 1970s, when I arrived in this place, I had black hair and long sideburns, and I was often seen to be somewhat like the Beatles with the length of my hair. Reg Withers was quick to take the micky out of me in relation to that—as he did, no doubt, with many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to draw to your attention some comments about Reg and how he was treated in public life. He was leader of the Senate for the coalition at the time of the dismissal. He obviously had a very significant role to play at that time. However you saw those events, maintaining the discipline in the Senate was of fundamental importance. I do not say he was the architect of the dismissal. I think that many would claim that title. I think it is hard to go past people like Bob Ellicott, who gave advice, and Malcolm Fraser and John Howard, who were very much on the scene at that time. Maintaining Senate support from amongst the coalition supporters was of fundamental importance for that successful outcome. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He became a minister, and he had responsibility for electoral matters at a time when the arrangements for redistributions of electoral boundaries were in flux—were changing. There was a major redistribution in 1977. The first was proposed, I think, in 1974 by Fred Daly. It was disallowed in the Senate, which was the procedure that was then in place, and a redistribution was undertaken again in 1977.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of that redistribution some significant changes occurred. The changes where I was the member was that the seat that I held—Parramatta—fundamentally changed and the seat of Dundas was created. I can remember Reg Withers asking me whether I was happy to lose the name Parramatta—that maybe Dundas should be named Parramatta. I said that because the major commercial centre of Parramatta was no longer in the seat that the name should remain with the new seat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He took an interest in the naming of seats in Queensland. There was some controversy about the seat of McPherson, as I recall. Yes, it was the case that members were vitally interested in the way in which the seats were named, and there was an inquiry set up by a judge. Somebody said to me later that they chose, for that inquiry, one of the most legalistic judges you could find, and that judge made some observations about a minister offering advice about the names of seats. I do not think that was of great moment—and I do not think I am alone in thinking that. I read where Fred Chaney, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time when Reg left, said at the time he was campaigning about the Dismissal that he thought Reg Withers had been treated harshly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested that, at the time Reg retired, John Button also spoke in the Senate. He remarked upon Reg's many ministerial and parliamentary roles—that he had been Chairman of Committees, Government Whip and Leader of the Government in the Senate. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I suppose that I will remember Reg Withers best because he was a tough, shrewd politician—a professional politician, in a sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to talk about the way Reg Withers was removed. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… Reg Withers is a politician who was most unfairly treated when he was removed from the Fraser Ministry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take that point—that there seems to be a bipartisan view that that was in fact the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is appropriate for this House to note that those views are held. He was not somebody who failed; he was somebody who contributed to public life over 20 years. He continued his interest in service of the community after he left parliament. I think we are entitled to remember him in a very positive way as somebody who contributed significantly to this nation. I extend to his widow Shirley the condolences of the Ruddock family. To his son Simon, whom I know, and his other children and grandchildren, I extend our condolences as well. I think it is appropriate that we will all remember Reg Withers positively.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  With the passing of Wayne Goss, Queenslanders have lost one of their finest leaders. Wayne changed Queensland, the state we love, for the better. He dragged it into the sunlight after 32 years in the darkness. He was a leader of deep integrity. He was someone that we will all miss a lot. I remember Wayne as a role model for leadership and integrity and as a man who always held humble Queenslanders close to his heart. Certainly we extend our condolences to his family—to Ro, Caitlin and Ryan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the service in Brisbane at the Gallery of Modern Art on Friday, it was really an appropriate venue. With the Rolling Stones belting it out, standing there in the middle of modern Brisbane, fantastic modern art on the walls—it really demonstrated just how much Queensland had changed. The foundations and platform for that change were set during Wayne's term. When Wayne was elected, he was the first Labor Premier of Queensland in 32 years. Only rarely—usually only once every second or perhaps every third political generation—do you see changes of leadership, breakthrough moments like that. As I observed last week, we saw it with Gough Whitlam, we have seen it with Neville Wran, we have seen it with Don Dunstan and we have seen it with John Cain: they were all recognised as great Labor leaders. It is easy to put their success down to timing, to the fact that finally 'It's time,' but those of us who were around in 1989 know it is not just the years in opposition or even the decay of the governing party that wins those breakthrough election victories. It is the emergence of leaders of exceptional quality, people with the right combination of political toughness, personal probity, moral purpose and, above all, true idealism. They are the people who bring the crumbling empires down. Wayne Goss was one of those breakthrough leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A barber's son from Inala, Wayne was inspired by Gough Whitlam. Like Gough, he believed in social justice and he lived it. He took a Labor Party in Queensland obsessed with the spoils of defeat and, after less than two years as leader, made us a governing party for the next 20 years. In everything Wayne did, he inspired by example. For Wayne, it was not about him. It was not about his ego. It was always about what he wanted for the people he represented. What he wanted was an outward looking Queensland, a vibrant Queensland, and he understood that that could only come from lasting, long-term changes. Many were put in place: electoral reform, accountability in public life, respect for human rights, antidiscrimination legislation, land rights legislation and, for the first time, women appointed to the judiciary and senior positions in the public service. Above all, he believed in the empowering gift of education, as it had empowered his own life, and environmental protection, including the World Heritage protection of Fraser Island and the protection of Cape York. This is a legacy which will endure for decades to come. With his passing, as I said at the beginning, we will remember Wayne as a role model for leadership, but above all I will remember him as a great mate, a good friend, and we think of his family when we pass this motion today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="9K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms GAMBARO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I stand here today with great sadness to speak to this condolence motion for the late Wayne Goss, who in my view was a great parliamentarian, a great Premier and a great Queenslander. As the federal member for Brisbane and on behalf of the whole Gambaro family, I want to express my condolences to the Goss family, and in particular to his wife, Roisin, and children, Ryan and Caitlin. This must be an incredibly difficult time for them, and my thoughts and prayers are with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My family knew Wayne Goss for more than 30 years. Despite the fact that he came from a different side of politics, I was always impressed by his unwavering commitment in pursuing what was best for Queensland. It was also my great privilege to have had Wayne Goss as a constituent. Far too often in this place we let petty churlishness and political differences stand in the way of properly acknowledging the good qualities and the strengths of our political opponents. I hope and would like to think that we can as a parliament rise above this incredibly short-sighted dynamic and embrace a more enlightened view of each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the spirit of this approach, it was my great honour to have been able to attend the memorial service that was held for Wayne Goss in Brisbane last Friday at the Gallery of Modern Art, with former National Party Premier of Queensland the Hon. Rob Borbidge and his wife, Jennifer, and former Liberal Queensland Treasurer the Hon. Sir Llew Edwards. The Hon. Ian Macfarlane was representing the Prime Minister, and the Hon. Campbell Newman was also in attendance. It was incredibly gratifying for me to be part of such an apolitical recognition of a great Labor Premier of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, Wayne was a shining example of never letting obstacles or setbacks get in the way. His battle with cancer took place over many years, but his refusal to let that prevent him from contributing to public life, through his involvement in the business and education sectors, is an example to us all. On the political front, Wayne Goss brought a new dimension of professionalism to the Labor Party in Queensland. As Premier, he had new ideas and a new vision for Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been much talk lately about the nation losing a giant with the passing of Gough Whitlam. Sadly, Queensland now has lost a giant as well. Wayne Goss once said that he hoped that he had left Queensland a better place. For me, there is no doubt that he did, not just through his contribution in political life but also through his work in the business and education sectors, as well as the tireless work that he did in the Indigenous community throughout the state. He will be missed by his friends and family and the grateful state of Queensland that he served with distinction.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  On the day that Wayne Goss died earlier this month I was, by coincidence, attending a speech night at Woodridge high school in my electorate which was also, for a time, in Wayne's electorate of Logan. He was the Premier of Queensland but he was also proudly, from 1986 to the late 1990s, the member for Logan as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wayne Goss was an inspirational figure and he was a transformational figure. I am grateful for the opportunity to put on the record my community's appreciation of his leadership, my state's appreciation of that leadership and also some personal reflections as a Logan City boy, a Queenslander and a product of the state that Wayne Goss built and the party that Wayne Goss built—in both cases unrecognisable from what they replaced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was only in grade 6 in 1989 but I knew that something was afoot in Queensland. You could not turn on the radio in mum's car as you were going home from the grocery shopping or anything like that without hearing about this thing called the Fitzgerald inquiry. You knew, in the mid to late eighties and before that as well, that something was seriously wrong with the way Queensland was governed. We knew when we had this guy—this fresh face—called Wayne Goss still in his 30s, remarkably, going for the premiership of our state that something big was going on. My first memories of Wayne were from my mum who used to work the night shift for many years at Sunnybank hospital. One of the first things she would often say she came through the door after a night on the night shift was, 'I saw the Premier jogging this morning', because where he would jog in the mornings coincided with the time and the way my mum drove home from Sunnybank to Springwood in the morning. So mum would often mention that she had seen the Premier out there in his singlet, running long distances as a very fit Premier of Queensland. That is my first memory of Wayne Goss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I realised later, as I got interested in politics and became more aware, that 1989 was really a watershed. The election of 1989 was really a watershed in the history of our state. It was arguably the key date of change in the modern history of Queensland, because of the change that was brought in—from an old regime characterised by drift and corruption to a new regime characterised by economic modernisation, social justice and all the things that make Queensland a much better place now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Wayne campaigned in 1989, he campaigned on the basis that Labor was the only change for the better. He gave Queenslanders a choice and they grabbed it. They turned their back on that corruption and drift and chose economic modernisation, integrity and, above all, social justice. There are so many achievements of the Wayne Goss government. Other speakers, including the member for Lilley who I am honoured to follow here today, mentioned some of the achievements of the Goss government. They are extraordinary: electoral reform, all the Fitzgerald inquiry recommendations implemented; merit-based appointments to the public service; the decriminalisation of homosexuality; gun laws, the first ever in Queensland; the first female cabinet minister in Queensland appointed; the infamous police Special Branch abolished; and the ban on street marches lifted so that people could express their opinions peacefully without risk of arrest. He introduced the Queensland Conservation Act; stopped rainforest logging and extended the National Park estate; put some of the wet tropics on the World Heritage List; and introduced the teaching of Asian languages in Queensland schools. That was such a remarkable thing that other states around Australia, via the COAG process, adopted the Queensland model for teaching Asian languages in schools—something that would have been unheard of in the years prior to Wayne Goss becoming Premier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But beyond all of these tangible improvements—beyond the legacies Wayne Goss left when we lost him—were the intangible things, the things that cannot be measured. Above all he taught Queenslanders to believe in ourselves. He was a tremendous rugby league fan. Even up to the last year of his life he was a tremendous supporter of the Brisbane Broncos and the Queensland Maroons He told us that Queensland could be big achievers beyond the football field, as important as that is. Beyond the football field, he taught us that we could believe in ourselves; that achievements need not be limited to sport—they could be achievements based on our minds and our merit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, he was the Premier but he was also the member for Logan and I am honoured to represent a big swathe of Logan City. I am honoured to support my great friend Linus Power as he attempts to win Wayne Goss's old seat back for Labor at the next opportunity in the next few months. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Wayne Goss did for Queensland, he did for Logan as well. He taught Logan people that we were good enough to have a premier from within our ranks and to believe in ourselves. I have lost count of the number of people who have streamed through the door at my electorate office or stopped me at events to say that Wayne Goss allowed Logan people to walk a bit taller. He was the Premier but he was not just any kind of Premier; he was a Premier who believed in social justice and giving opportunities to kids from areas like mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the real achievements that has not been mentioned much in the welcome praise of Wayne Goss's life was for the role he played in getting a university campus in Logan City. The first ever; the only one. The Logan campus of Griffith University—Wayne Goss fought to make that happen. The National Party did not want a university in Logan City; they did not think that was appropriate. They wanted one on the Gold Coast; they wanted one in Brisbane—they did not want one in my community. I think it says a lot about Wayne Goss that he fought to make a university campus in Logan City a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the memorial on Friday, at which the member for Lilley spoke so eloquently, I got to sit with some teachers from some of our Woodridge schools. I got to sit amongst great branch members. Wayne Goss was a branch member in my area until the day he died. There were some other branch members at that memorial service on Friday, such as Sheryn and Roger East—some great branch members. Lots of people from our area in Logan were there to commemorate a tremendous life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard stories of an intelligent man, but most of all a man brimming with integrity. There were so many great contributions, speeches and videos that I do not have the time to run through all of the wonderful stories that people told about Wayne Goss's life. But I want to single out his wife, Ro; his daughter, Caitlin, who gave a speech on behalf of herself and her brother Ryan; and Wayne's brother who gave a tremendous contribution. We send them our thoughts and our prayers at a difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing I like most about the contributions that were made at the memorial service were that we also heard that Wayne had a remarkable capacity for humility, humour and self-deprecation. But, above all, he was marked by leadership. I had a great conversation with one of his tremendous friends Dennis Atkins about the intangibility of leadership that Wayne Goss had that was evident to all who met him. He was a leader; he had tremendous developed leadership skills but he was a natural. The way that he led our state showed that to be true. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wayne Goss also assembled remarkable people around him. The people who went to work with him, to help him, are a mark of his leadership: the member for Lilley went on to become the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer; the former member for Griffith went on to become the Prime Minister; two university vice-chancellors used to work for Wayne Goss; and a CEO of one of the best disability services groups in the country. All of these people who went on to make remarkable contributions began their professional life—in a substantial way—under the leadership of Wayne Goss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I only got to know him after he was Premier. The first time I spoke to him was in 1999. He called me; I was a young bureaucrat in the Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet. He was giving a speech and he wanted a hand with it. I was very nervous; I worked all night for two or three nights in my own time to try and give him the perfect work. He rang me afterwards to thank me. I was terrified when the phone: it was Wayne Goss. I said, 'How did it go?' He said, 'It went brilliantly.' I said, 'That's great,' and I thought I was going to get some really good feedback. I said, 'What specifically?' He said,' The bits that I wrote went brilliantly. The bits you wrote, not so much.' I was terrified about that. I went to another friend of Wayne's and asked if he was joking. They said, 'No, probably not. He was probably serious.' That was the first time I got to know him. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to him many times after that when I was working for the member for Lilley. He was a tremendous source of advice during my own preselection. At times I would have a cup of tea with him. I would go with Anthony Chisholm, the state secretary of the Queensland branch, and sit on Wayne's balcony at Teneriffe and have a chat. I saw him at Dennis Atkins's 60th birthday; it was the last time I saw him.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Wayne Goss and his family, we say: thank you, Wayne, for making us proud to be Queenslanders and proud to be part of the great Australian Labor Party; for allowing us and teaching us to believe in ourselves at a state level but also in my community; for your life of leadership and social justice, intelligence and integrity; and, most of all, for making Queensland a better place. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I rise to contribute to this condolence motion for Wayne Goss. I knew Wayne Goss for a number of years. Mr Goss was Chairman of Free TV Australia, which is the main representative body for the television industry in Australia; I was on the board of that organisation and so I had the opportunity to work quite closely with him over a number of years. In that time, I found him to be a person of great intellect and of high integrity and a person who was extremely professional. In the sometimes flamboyant television industry, he was a very steady hand, someone who did not get swept up in the emotions of the day but, rather, had a very steady and professional approach. Indeed, if I were to use one word to describe Mr Goss based on my knowledge of him, it would be 'professional'. He was the ultimate professional, in my experience.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did on occasion discuss politics. Obviously, we had some different views, but they were always very respectful and convivial discussions. I will leave it to others to talk about Queensland politics. There are plenty of others who know a lot more about that than I do. But I would say that I know he was proud of his achievements, and there is no doubt there were a significant number of them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, from my experience and, I am sure, that of other members of the House who knew him, we would all agree that he was a good man and a man of high integrity—and, ultimately, there is nothing more important than that.</span>

Each year Treasury provide opportunities for staff at a range of levels to undertake secondments at a number of APS and private sector organisations.</span>
