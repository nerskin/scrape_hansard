                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July 2016, the coalition government delivered reforms to country-of-origin labelling to provide a clearer, simpler system that enables Australians to clearly see where their food comes from and the proportion that comes from our nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surveys have shown that consumers want this information at their fingertips. Seventy-four per cent of Australians think it's important to be able to identify the country of origin of their food, and 73 per cent agreed that changes to food labelling were required.</span>

As a result of the work we've already done, everyday Aussie brands like Sanitarium, KR Castlemaine, COON and Cracker Barrel cheese, Beechworth Honey and Carman's muesli are proudly displaying their home-grown products with their new country-of-origin labelling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Incorporating the standard will ensure authorised officers can continue to enforce the country-of-origin labelling requirements for imported food products. It will also ensure that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources can continue its role in enforcing country-of-origin labelling at the border.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This makes the financial system unique. Australia has many vital economic sectors, but few are so unavoidable and critical to the lives of everyday Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stability of our financial system is also central to the successful operation of the Australian economy, and a key strength.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is crucial that the government ensures that the Australian people get the high-quality, safe and secure financial system they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what does the government expect of our financial system?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We expect not only a system that is unquestionably strong but also one that operates with the utmost integrity and is unquestionably accountable. Given the social licence under which the banks operate, we expect a system which is prudently managed, serving the interests of the customers who use the system and the wellbeing of their community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We expect the system to be robustly competitive, driving prices down and fostering innovative new product offerings. We expect a system that is overseen by world-class regulators which have all the necessary tools at their disposal to execute the mandate they've been given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over recent years, the system has not always met these expectations. Time and time again we've seen scandals demonstrate that some in the system are more invested in their own interests than those of their customers and the community they are supposed to serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Australians are fair-minded, and they're sensible. Businesses are supposed to make a profit; that's the point. Indeed, many Australians are shareholders in our financial sector institutions and share in the benefits of their profits and success; that's the point. A profitable, well-capitalised financial industry is in the interests of the Australian community and our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But where these objectives are pursued at the expense of the integrity or stability of our financial system, then the broader national and community interests are not being advanced. Too often, Australians have not been given a fair go by some in the financial system. What's worse, the actions of some are damaging the reputation of the system as a whole and the work done by so many thousands who work in the banking system, doing the right thing for the right reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what should a responsible government do in these circumstances?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it takes action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is precisely what the Turnbull government is doingâ€”taking action now on our banking and financial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have increased the power and resources of ASIC to deal with malfeasance in the sector. That's done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have introduced the Major Bank Levy, legislated through this place, which ensures that our largest banks pay their fair share, in recognition of the advantaged and protected position they hold in our financial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have banned excessive surcharges on credit card transactions, delivering real savings on Australians' everyday transactions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have introduced a new alternative way to handle complaints and disputes so there can be fairer avenues to have issues resolved that are more affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have instituted, through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, an inquiry that regularly looks into the Australian banking and financial system, including how the major banks balance the needs of borrowers, savers, shareholders and the wider community. And I commend the member for Banks for his outstanding work as the chair of that committee, as well as the members of that committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills I introduce today build on all of these actions that the Turnbull government is taking. They represent a seismic change in the accountability of our banking system and the executives who run it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures represent world's best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this packageâ€”not just in the bill that I introduce specifically here but in the bills that will followâ€”will enhance the integrity, stability, resilience and competitiveness of the financial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package I introduce today includes measures that will comprehensively overhaul APRA's powers, including powers to impose consequences under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, enhanced APRA crisis management powers, and new rule-making and data collection powers for APRA over non-bank lenders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, they represent the most significant overhaul of APRA's powers since its creation by the Howard government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial markets cannot operate efficiently unless participants have confidence in the stability and integrity of the systemâ€”and this package gives reason to have that confidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package will also increase the competitiveness of the banking system by opening doors to innovative new entrants and levelling the playing field by opening access to the term 'bank' to all licensed banking businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Competition and innovation are the keys to improving the customer experience for all Australians. Alongside this measure, the government has also encouraged APRA to enhance its licensing processes and APRA has now rolled out a new licensing regime that will encourage innovative new entrants into our banking system, creating more competition. Building on this strong start, the government will have more to say about competition in the financial sector in coming months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the package builds on our reforms to the consumer credit card experience by introducing a measure which will improve competition in the credit card market and help prevent vulnerable consumers from building up excessive credit card debt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now turn to the Bank Executive Accountability Regime, also known as the BEAR.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier, I explained why the financial system is so integral to the wellbeing of the Australian people. Banks occupy a particularly central and privileged role within that system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the critical roles banks play within the community, bank directors and executives need to be held to an especially high standard of accountability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes banks so special?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, it is virtually impossible for Australians to go about their daily lives without a bank account. It's how we get paid, and increasingly, how we make payments. We can choose which bank we want to bank with, but it is very difficult not to bank at all. Given Australians are locked into dealing with banks, it is appropriate that bank executives are held to a higher standard by the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, banks benefit from an extraordinarily privileged regulatory environment that advantages them, particularly the larger banks. Virtually all depositors in Australian banks are protected by a government guarantee, known as the 'Financial Claims Scheme' or FCS. This makes it much easier for banks to attract depositors, because depositors know that their money will be protected if anything goes wrong. To understand how significant an advantage this is, consider what an equivalent would look like for the car industryâ€”it would be like providing a free warranty on new cars. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, banks are fundamentally important to financial stability, and financial stability is fundamentally important to Australia's economic wellbeing. History has shown that crises that begin in banking rarely end thereâ€”they infect the entire economy. Our Australian banking system performed extremely well during the global financial crisis as a result of good stewardship, which I would commend, and the forward-thinking regulation by the then Treasurer, Mr Costello, in advance of that crisis. The government is once again taking a proactive approach in ensuring that the regulatory framework continues to protect the financial wellbeing of the Australian community and the economy more generally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banking executives share responsibility for the stewardship of the Australian economy and they make decisions that impact upon the lives of ordinary Australians who have no choice other than to engage with the system they help run. As a consequence, the community reasonably expects higher standards of accountability and integrity of banking directors and executives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The BEAR ensures that where these community expectations are not met, appropriate consequences will follow. It makes clear individual accountabilities so that it is clear where the buck stops in decision making and responsibility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now turn to some of the provisions of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill imposes new heightened accountability obligations on banks, as authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs, and their accountable persons. The definition of accountable persons will encompass both a prescribed and principles based approach and will capture the most senior directors and executives within authorised deposit-taking institution groups; that is, those who influence the overall conduct and culture of the group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ADIs will be required to register their accountable persons with APRA and clearly allocate responsibilities to accountable persons via accountability statements and accountability maps. These steps will provide clarity of responsibilities and ensure that APRA has greater visibility of the most senior persons in ADI groups in order to more easily assign accountability should there be a breach of the BEAR obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support these new accountability obligations, the bill increases consequences for ADIs and accountable persons who do not meet their obligations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ADIs will be required to defer minimum amounts of their accountable persons' variable remuneration for a period of four years. The amount to be deferred will vary with the size of the ADI, so that smaller ADIs will not be disproportionately impacted in their ability to attract senior talent. Mandating deferral of variable remuneration, combined with provisions in the bill that remuneration policies will include provisions for reductions in variable remuneration where an accountable person fails to comply with their accountability obligations, will increase incentives for these people to focus on the long-term outcomes of their decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides APRA with enhanced disqualification powers. APRA will be able to disqualify an accountable person directly, without needing to apply to the Federal Court. Importantly, given the significance of such a decision for an individual's career and livelihood, accountable persons will be able to seek merits review and judicial review of APRA's decisions, which is appropriate. These new powers will ensure APRA can more easily respond where an accountable person has failed to comply with their accountability obligations, while ensuring appropriate external oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For ADIs, the bill introduces substantial new civil penalties, of up to $210 million for large ADIs, $52.5 million for medium-sized ADIs and $10.5 million for small ADIs, where an institution breaches any requirements of the BEAR that relate to prudential matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, schedule 2 of the bill includes a number of provisions that provide APRA with the power to examine witnesses. These provisions broadly replicate existing powers that APRA has in relation to other institutions, including in the superannuation sector. While these powers will apply to the Banking Act generally, they will support APRA's enforcement of the BEAR.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The BEAR will commence on 1 July 2018, with transitional arrangements for certain elements of the regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2017-18 budget provided APRA with $4.2 million over four years to implement the BEAR. A further $1 million per year will be provided to APRA to enforce breaches. This funding will be offset by corresponding increases in the financial institutions supervisory levies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly thank the Treasury for the excellent work they have done in working with me and my office as we have sought over the course of this year to prepare these measures, which were announced in the budget. In so doing, I acknowledge the Treasury secretary, Mr Fraser, as well as the deputy secretary, Mr Lonsdale, and the entire team for the outstanding work they have done at a fast pace. They have understood the importance of this issueâ€”getting it right but ensuring that this accountability regime can be put in place and ensuring that the government is in a position to take action now. I commend them on the professionalism of their work and the way they have gone about it. Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are few greater threats to the economic wellbeing of the Australian people than a financial crisis. Financial crises have the ability to devastate an economy, leading to mass unemployment and plunging asset prices. In a crisis, credit markets may seize up, meaning no loans for home buyers or small businesses. This would have a severe effect on the wellbeing of ordinary Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Turnbull government is taking action to put in place a far-sighted framework to protect Australians against an uncontrolled financial collapse in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has avoided a severe financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s and has not experienced a recession for more than 26 years, an enviable record around the world today. While good fortune always plays its part in these outcomes, it can honestly be said that this period of success can be attributed to prudent economic management, in particular of our financial system, which enabled us to withstand the most recent world economic crisis. The strong budget surpluses accumulated by the Howard government had paid off debt as we entered that crisis, ensuring that we had the firepower on the Commonwealth balance sheet to navigate the global financial crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more importantly, Treasurer Costello implemented reforms recommended by the Wallis financial system inquiry, establishing the twin peaks system of our financial regulation. Treasurer Costello's forward-thinking structure proved to be the world's best practice during the crisis, and he deserves significant credit for our ability to move through that period. We had a prudential regulator in place in APRA that shepherded our major financial institutions away from the worst excesses that we saw overseas. APRA's excellent supervision and robust capital requirements meant that Australian institutions navigated the crisis relatively unscathed. In short, the Howard government and Treasurer Costello in particular took the tough decisions during the 'good times', which meant that the Australian economy survived the 'bad times'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is taking the same approach. Prudent fiscal management is working to repair the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also responding to the Murray inquiry into our financial system, established after the coalition took office in 2013. The Murray inquiry followed in the footsteps of the Wallis inquiry, making key recommendations to enhance the stability of the Australian financial system, and I commend Treasurer Hockey for instituting the financial system inquiry undertaken by David Murray. In July I was pleased to welcome APRA's initiative to ensure that capital levels at Australian banks were 'unquestionably strong', in response to the first recommendation of the Murray inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will continue to support APRA's efforts to ensure that the Australian financial system is resilient. The resilience of the financial system is the first line of defence against financial crises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray inquiry also recommended that government implement appropriate crisis management powers over banks and insurers, and the bill does just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These powers will ensure that APRA can effectively prepare for and manage a crisis should it befall one of our banks or insurers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The prudent time to strengthen crisis resolution powers is when the financial system is healthy. As we've seen, you need to put the effort in during the good times to be ready for the difficult times. The government has done the necessary heavy lifting, from the work of the Murray inquiry through to the substantial volume of legislation I am introducing today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will significantly enhance APRA's crisis resolution powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two core themes for this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first theme is enhancements to the resolution planning framework. Resolution planning refers to the process of banks and insurers working with APRA to ensure that they are ready for stress events. APRA already puts considerable effort into resolution planning, but the legislative framework does not give APRA clear powers to make prudential standards for resolution. We are addressing this gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Done right, resolution planning will substantially reduce the cost to the taxpayer of a stress event. It leads to the best chance of a private sector solution or an orderly resolution of the entity. Orderly resolutions reduce the risk of contagion leading to a runaway crisis of confidence in the institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second theme is resolution powers. Resolution powers are the financial system equivalent of a defence force. You never want to have to use them but, if you need to, you want them to be powerful and you want them to be flexible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's powers are starting from a reasonable base. APRA can already take control of a failing bank or insurer when needed, and this bill further enhances these powers. However, larger banks and insurers tend to be part of a complex financial group. Group entities will often house critical services, like staff or infrastructure. To ensure an effective resolution, APRA needs to be able to either direct or take control of all of these necessary group entities. This bill makes amendments to the legislative framework to ensure that this is the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International experience has shown that the role of directors and senior officers of a distressed institution is critical. A crisis can put these individuals in difficult legal circumstances, where the regulator's attempts to institute a resolution may conflict with 'peacetime' legal obligations. This bill ensures that APRA's resolution actions should be considered paramount, and directors and senior officers will be protected when pursuing these directions in all reasonable circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also improves APRA's ability to manage a foreign bank branch or insurance branch that is in distress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Large institutions also tend to have a wideranging amount of complex legal arrangements with sophisticated counterparties. These arrangements often contain default provisions which allow counterparties to break or 'close out' their position with the distressed institution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulators need to be able to 'stop the music'â€”in other words, to buy time to institute an effective resolution strategy. This bill ensures that APRA is able to freeze the rights of counterparties of a financial group in appropriate circumstances to carve out the time necessary to effect a resolution. This is achieved in a way which preserves, to the extent possible, the certainty of counterparties when dealing with Australian banks and insurers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a number of technical amendments that ensure the machinery of government operates as intended during a resolution event. This includes technical enhancements to the operation of the Financial Claims Scheme and the efficacy of the legal framework for the conversion of capital instruments under the Basel III framework. These mechanical fixes will increase efficiency and certainty in the event of a crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taken together, these themes represent a significant leap in APRA's capability as a resolution authority, accompanying its traditional core role as a prudential supervisor. They will ensure that Australia's regulatory infrastructure is in line with international best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst government will continue to work to do everything in its power to avoid financial crises, through our prudent economic management, we are taking the prudent step of safeguarding the system for the wellbeing of current and future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Treasury officials for their support in the preparation of this legislation. I also wish to commend and thank APRA; the APRA chair, Wayne Byers; and all of those at APRA who have assisted with the preparation of these measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 1 and 2 to the bill provide APRA with a new reserve power to make rules in relation to non-bank lenders, called 'non-ADI lenders'. This will provide APRA the necessary flexibility to address risks to financial stability if they emerge. This measure also enhances APRA's ability to gather data to monitor non-ADI lenders. I stress that this is a reserve power.</span>

These lenders are a vital source of competition in the lending market, and they do not rely on ordinary Australian depositors for their funding. Given non-ADI lenders have no depositors to protect, it is appropriate that they continue to run their businesses without being subject to ongoing prudential supervision by APRA which is not the intent of this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, international experience has demonstrated that risks can emerge from the non-ADI lending sector that threaten the stability of the financial system. It is appropriate for APRA to have the power to move decisively to curb these risks should they ever arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having such rules in place should strengthen the non-ADI lending sector, by signalling to market that the sector is well regulated and stable, as appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have often spoken of the need to approach financial stability risks with a scalpel rather than a chainsaw, and these powers will provide APRA a new scalpel to deal with risks to financial stability that are specific to non-ADI lenders, as appropriate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill lifts the prohibition on the use of the term 'bank', so that all banking businesses with an ADI licence can now use the term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will encourage competition in the sector by allowing all ADIs to enjoy the benefit of describing themselves as a bank when they offer banking services to Australian customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will prompt innovation in the sector by opening the door to new banking entrants who will no longer be subject to the systemic barrier to entry of not being able to call themselves a bank when offering banking services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to modernise the Banking Act by incorporating a reference to the importance of APRA considering 'geographic and sectoral' considerations where appropriate. Government is putting APRA's powers and responsibilities to take account of these considerationsâ€”in line with its prudential mandateâ€”beyond doubt. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many Australians are burdened with excessive credit card debt and incur substantial credit card interest. More than 30 per cent of credit card holders in the lowest income quartile carry interest-bearing debt from period to period. For these consumers, inadequate competition on ongoing interest rates and insufficient protection in the current regulatory framework can contribute to real hardship. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 of the bill implements reforms to ensure consumers can afford credit card contracts, to reduce the barriers consumers face when switching credit cards, and to align the calculation of credit card interest with consumers' expectations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now provide more detail on these measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since December 2014, APRA has taken a series of steps to address emerging financial stability risks by reinforcing the lending practices of banks and other ADIs, particularly in relation to residential home loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these measures are effective in mitigating financial stability risks, the tightening of credit from ADIs creates room for non-ADI lenders to fill in the gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although their current share of lending is relatively small, these non-ADI lenders may expand rapidly and their lending activities could potentially pose material risks to financial stabilityâ€”risks that ultimately fall on the broader Australian community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global financial crisis showed us how costly these risks can be when left unaddressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, APRA does not have power over these lending activities, even where they materially contribute to financial stability risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill will provide APRA with these powers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">APRA will be able to make rules relating to lending practices of non-ADI lenders, where it considers that their lending activities materially contribute to financial stability risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These new rules will be backed by appropriate enforcement mechanisms. If a non-ADI lender fails to comply with a rule, it can be compelled by APRA to comply. If it ignores an APRA direction, the non-ADI lender will face appropriate penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill enhances APRA's ability to collect data from non-ADI lenders, so it can better monitor the non-ADI lender sector and determine if and when to use its new rule-making power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In making this determination, APRA will use its independent judgement. However, it is likely APRA will consider a number of factors including: the size of the sector; the nature of activities of non-ADI lenders; and the impact of non-ADI lenders on ADIs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before it makes a rule, APRA must consult ASIC, and will also ordinarily consult with the other members of the Council of Financial Regulators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rule-making power is a reserve power that would only be used when APRA considers that the lending activities of non-ADI lenders are materially contributing to risks of financial instability. In other words, the government is providing APRA with a new 'tool' in its kitâ€”rather than requiring the day-to-day operations of these entities to be regulated by APRA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes that non-ADI lenders are not currently materially contributing to financial stability risks and therefore the government does not expect APRA to use these powers on day one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 helps innovative new banking entrants bring new product offerings into the Australian banking system. New entrants to the Australian banking market currently face a significant obstacle, and that is the prohibition on the use of the word 'bank'.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">it discourages innovative new players from entering the sector, because they are unable to benefit from the advantages of being able to use the term 'bank' in the critical early phase of their development; and</span>

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">it may lead the public to mistakenly believe that small ADIs differ from larger players in terms of regulatory protection.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By lifting the prohibition on the use of the word 'bank', schedule 2 to this bill will allow the advantages associated with the term 'bank' to flow to all banking businesses with an ADI licence, especially new fin-tech entrants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It breaks the vicious cycle for new entrants, where currently they need $50 million to describe themselves as a bank, but must describe themselves as a bank in order to grow.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Competition in banking drives down interest rates for borrowers, drives down fees, increases interest rates for savers, and leads to advancements in the overall customer experience. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will also ensure that there are no misconceptions about the regulatory safeguards that apply to all ADIs in the Australian financial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 will also reinforce APRA's discretion over whether or not to permit the use of 'bank' outside of the ADI sector, ensuring that this term is limited to APRA regulated entities except in very unusual cases. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 modernises the Banking Act by inserting an 'objects' provision. This clarifies APRA's mandate under the act, clearly setting out APRA's objectives to protect financial stability and depositors. It also makes clear that APRA can consider geographic and sectoral sources of system risks issues as appropriate and respond as appropriate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent conditions have highlighted the fact that the Australian economy differs considerably from region to region. APRA has broad and flexible powers, but there is no clear statement in the Banking Act that APRA has a responsibility to take account of geographic or sectoral issues where appropriate. Government is putting APRA's powers and responsibilities to address these issuesâ€”in line with its prudential mandateâ€”beyond doubt.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many benefits to the use of credit cards for consumers. However, for some consumers very high interest rates and a pattern of overborrowing and under-repayment can cause them to incur persistently high credit card interest charges. These consumers are often in households with low levels of income, with the lowest income households having credit card debt equal to four per cent of their annual disposable income, compared to two per cent for those in the highest income category.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these consumers, inadequate competition on ongoing interest rates and insufficient protection in the current regulatory framework can contribute to substantial hardship. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, credit card providers are only required to assess a credit card contract as unsuitable if the borrower cannot repay the loan without substantial hardship. This means that some credit card providers only assess whether a consumer can meet the minimum repayments when determining if a consumer can afford a credit limit. As a result, consumers can be granted excessive credit limits which can lead to cycles of debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the calculation of credit card interest can be overly complex and often does not match consumers' expectations or understanding. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumers can also face substantial barriers to switching credit cards or lowering credit limits due to onerous processes imposed by banks. These barriers have a substantial impact on competition in the credit card market. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 of this bill addresses these problems by implementing a reform package to reduce the incidence of consumers building up unsustainable credit card debt and to improve competition in the credit card market. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is consistent with the government's commitment to implementing the first phase of reforms outlined in the government's response to the Senate inquiry into the credit card market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, Schedule 5 will tighten responsible lending obligations for credit card providers by requiring affordability assessments to be based on whether a consumer can repay the full credit limit within a reasonable period. The bill will provide the Australian Securities and Investments Commission with the power to determine that reasonable period by legislative instrument. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform is not intended to unduly reduce consumers' access to credit. As such, ASIC is required to balance the need to prevent consumers from being in unsuitable credit card contracts with the need to ensure that reasonable access to credit is maintained when determining the reasonable conduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, schedule 5 will prohibit all unsolicited credit limit increase invitations including where a consumer has previously opted in to receiving these invitations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition of a credit limit increase invitation has also been expanded to include all forms of communication (rather than only written communication), removing the loopholes to prevent credit card providers from circumventing the law and making unsolicited offers by phone or over an online portal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 will put an end to the unfair and complex way that interest is calculated on credit cards and make it easier for consumers to understand and compare how credit card interest is calculated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Credit card providers will no longer be able to charge backdated interest or interest on the balance that has already been repaid if a consumer does not fully repay their outstanding balance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, schedule 5 will require credit card providers to have online options for consumers to initiate a credit card cancellation or lower a credit limit. Consumers can face substantial barriers when trying to cancel a credit card and this reduces competition and limits how consumers can manage their credit card debt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 requires credit card providers to facilitate any requests to cancel a credit card or lower a credit limit and prevents them from employing tactics to dissuade or impede consumers from cancelling a credit card or lowering a credit limit. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive) Bill 2017 will amend the tax law to replace the former exploration development incentive with the junior minerals exploration incentive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is focused on promoting investment and driving economic activity. Ongoing exploration and the discovery of new mineral resources are vital to the longer term future of Australia's resources sector. This tax incentive will encourage junior explorers to take risks and to have a go at discovering the next large-scale mineral deposit. We want to back these small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is working to get the economic fundamentals right to build a strong prosperous Australia, improve the business climate and unleash our economic potential. We are doing so to create a stable platform for investor confidence and growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new incentive entitles Australian resident investors in small minerals exploration companies to a refundable tax offset (or where the investor is a corporate tax entity, additional franking credits) if the company in which they have invested issues them an exploration credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ability of an exploration company to give up their tax losses to distribute credits to investors as a tax offset will make investing in a junior explorer much more attractive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite good prospects, Australia has not had a world-class minerals discovery in more than 20 years. Expenditure on greenfields exploration declined by almost 70 per cent over the five years to 2015-16. This incentive will make it more financially attractive for our mineral explorers to find resources in untapped regions, continuing discovery of quality resources. It builds on the EDI which ceased in 2016-17, and aims to improve on the timeliness of the offset and target new investors that participate in new capital raisings. This will help maximise the incentive for additional investment in minerals exploration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does the extraction and sale of minerals resources make a significant contribution to the Australian economy; it also creates jobs and supports local businesses in regional communities across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greenfield minerals exploration is essential to ensuring an investment pipeline to support the future strength of the Australian resources sector. However, these exploration companies often find it difficult to raise the capital they need to explore. A $100 million tax incentive over four years, starting in 2017-18, will make this easier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Companies can obtain an allocation of credits by applying electronically to the Commissioner of Taxation. Credits will be allocated on a first come, first served basis, until the annual cap is reached, with any unallocated credits carried forward to the next year of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new process will be faster than the EDI as small exploration companies will know with certainty upfront how many credits they have been allocated before they undertake their capital raising to fund additional exploration activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that the benefits of the incentive are widely distributed, there is a cap on the amount of credits that may be allocated to an entity of five per cent of the total amount available for each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of introducing the new incentive, the excess exploration credit tax will apply to ensure minerals explorers seek to create and issue exploration credits only in circumstances in which they are entitled to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill is designed to protectâ€”for the workersâ€”the hundreds of millions of dollars held in these funds for workers' redundancy pay, sick leave and other employee benefits and to ensure these funds are spent for the benefit of workers and not for other purposes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given there is little governance of these funds, Commissioner Heydon found that there was a 'compelling case' for reform and that new laws were needed to comprehensively deal with governance, financial reporting and disclosure in worker entitlement funds. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the amount of money in these funds, and that the money in these funds is meant to be for the benefit of the workers, it is crucial that the moneys in these funds are managed transparently and responsibly and spent on genuine benefits for workers. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funds will still be able to spend money on training and welfare services for the benefit of workers, such as crisis counselling or health checks, but the arrangements will have to be reasonable, transparent, and made at arm's length.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes a number of other crucial changes recommended by the Heydon royal commission. In total, the bill implements 10 recommendations of the royal commission aimed at stopping corruption, coercion and financial mismanagement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill ensures that registered unions and employer organisations have written and binding policies on such things as financial decision making, credit card use, procurement, hospitality and gifts. The royal commission found that some unions did not have policies on these basic matters. Sometimes if there was a policy, it wasn't even written down. This is hardly a recipe for good financial management of other people's money and is certainly not in the interests of union members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides that enterprise agreements and employment contracts cannot include terms that require people to contribute to 'election funds' that are set up to fund the campaigns of people running for office in a union or employer group. These contributions should only be voluntary and not a condition of working for a union or employer group. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also prohibits people coercing employers to contribute to particular superannuation funds, welfare funds and other worker benefit funds. The royal commission heard cases of union officials placing extraordinary pressure on employers to pay into particular worker benefit funds, basically because the union stood to gain from the arrangement. There is no place for this sort of bullying and coercion in the workplace. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill requires unions, employer groups and employers to disclose any financial benefit they will receive from promoting or arranging insurance products, or payments to worker entitlement, training or welfare funds. This will ensure that employers who make these payments and employees who are supposed to be receiving a benefit are made aware of any conflicts of interest, similar to the arrangements the government introduced in regard to transparency in enterprise bargaining. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about transparency, good governance and the proper use of money that is there to help other people and should be used only for the benefit of those people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The Treloar collection's storage facility at Mitchell is an essential asset and the Australian War Memorial's conservation facility and store for large pieces of military equipment, including aircraft, vehicles, boats, missiles and guns. There is an immediate requirement for increased collection storage, as there is a significant planned handover of collections from the Department of Defence once additional storage capacity is available. These include a P3C Orion, an FA18 Classic Hornet, and Seahawk and Squirrel naval helicopters, which are due to be retired in the coming decade. </span>

The estimated cost to deliver the project is $16.1 million, excluding GST. This includes a provision for contingencies, cost escalation and associated professional fees. The committee has conducted an inquiry and it is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth, and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I'd like to thank the committee for, once again, undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in January 2018 and is expected to be completed by December 2018. I commend the motion to the House. </span>

The project will provide facilities to enable anchoring of enhanced wideband satellite communications. The proposed works will involve the construction of a transmission building, foundations for three satellite dishes, and associated supporting infrastructure and engineering services. The proposed site is an open field inside the southern boundary of the Kapooka Military Area. The facility will be serviced by a small number of maintenance personnel and operated remotely.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  As I started to say in my speech yesterday, Labor does not support mandatory minimums. We know that they can lead to fewer prosecutions and convictions, sometimes leading juries to acquit rather than sentence, and can conflict with the role of the judiciary. People will not have an incentive to plead guilty or inform the police on others' actions if they know they face a mandatory sentence. It builds in the incentive to fight and appeal against convictions. Even former Prime Minister John Howard has previously commented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ as a matter of principle I don't agree with mandatory sentencing â€¦ in the end I do think these matters ought to be determined by judges and magistrates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a shame Mr Howard isn't getting rolled out for his opinion on mandatory sentencing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council of Australia has urged the Senate to reject mandatory sentencing in bills, because of the real risk of unintended consequences with potentially life-shattering outcomes. There is no evidence that mandatory sentencing has the effect of reducing crime rates. Dangerously, this particular piece of legislation will have the unintended consequence of the proposed mandatory minimums possibly applying to teenagers. Examples of this provided in the Law Council of Australia's submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee included: an 18-year-old sexting a 15-year-old would lead to a mandatory sentence of five years for the 18-year-old; an 18-year-old sending an intimate image to a 15-year-old would lead to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for the 18-year-old; and where a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old might be sharing sexual images with each other in a consensual relationship, the day the older partner turns 18, the 18-year-old would be looking at an automatic five-year sentence. I agree these things may be criminal and, in accordance with the law, those people should be punished, but I'm not sure that the punishment of a five-year minimum sentence would serve that particular crime. We want responsible use of the internet and mobile messaging by our kids and teenagersâ€”I have three children: a 15-year-old, an 11 year-old and a nine-year-oldâ€”and I would not find one person who disagrees with that. I hope that our kids are sensible and don't engage in such behaviour, but, if they do, I don't want them to go to jail for a mandatory minimum term of five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The financial impact of this bill is stated as being largely limited to the costs associated with housing federal prisoners, and its overall financial impact on the states and territories will be negligible. This is yet another example of the Turnbull government fudging the figures on this. They have cut $184 million from the Australian Federal Police funding in the 2017-18 budget. This significantly reduces our federal law enforcement's capacity to hunt down perpetrators of this crime. The AFP needs funding to fight the paedophile rings that operate on our doorstep. This is a global challenge for our law enforcement agencies and the AFP; it reaches far beyond our borders. Children are being enslaved by paedophile rings with links to Australia, and sexual acts with adults are being live-streamed over the internet. These crimes are horrendous. Children are being held as sex slaves known as 'pay-per-view'. The children are routinely raped and that is streamed live via encrypted online video. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> reported that last year the AFP assessment centre received more than 8,000 reports of child exploitation. As of 21 September, it has already received more than 6,776 reports of child exploitation for this calendar year. These criminals are producing thousands and thousands of sexually explicit materials, depicting children being abused and brutalised. We must stop the online exploitation of children, and we must stop it within our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor always has and always will fight to protect children here and overseas from exploitation, abuse and sexual crimes. We are proud of our record under the Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments, and our achievements includeâ€”some of them we are all incredibly proud ofâ€”in 1994 introducing world-leading offences targeting Australians who engage in the sexual abuse of children overseas; bringing federal, state and territory governments together in 2009 to implement the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, which includes a funding commitment of $63.6 million over four years from the Commonwealth government; introducing new child abuse offences and protection measures in 2010; and establishing the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuseâ€”the first inquiry of this type at a national level. The royal commission, among other things, inquired into how systems have failed to protect children. It made many recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to sexual abuse in institutions. I look forward to the Redress Scheme. Labor's achievements also include appointing Australia's first National Children's Commissioner in 2013 to advocate for the rights of Australia's young people in and introducing the vulnerable witness act in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can always do more to protect our kids. I am a parent raising the first generation of social media users. We all have a responsibility to keep our kids safe whilst using the internet. We need to be aware of how much time our kids are on the internet and educate them about the possible dangers of chatting with people on the internet. We can sit with the kids and explore the internet together and monitor the sites they use. We can lock certain sites down and have software that monitors our children's email and social media. We can also check with our kids' schools and other schools in our communities as to what safety measures are in place to make sure our kids can talk with us about what is happening online. They need to be cybersafe. We will be voting for this bill but we will be seeking to amend it in the Senate, as I have pointed out. We need to make this something that we do together, make it tougher and not use it as political pointscoring. We need to make it more effective, because we know this is the best way to stop sexual offenders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work done by a community group in my community, called the Queen of Hearts Foundation, and the founder and director of that organisation, Michelle Ellery. In 2014 the Queen of Hearts Foundation was established in my community to run a community based resource centre that supports men, women and children. Their mission is to protect kids and support survivors of child sexual abuse and domestic violence on their journey for justice and healing. I would like to take this opportunity to read into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> how incredible the work is that they are doing for those vulnerable children who have been victims of sexual abuse. I must admit that, when I first learned of the incredible work that was being done, I had to remind myself we were still in Australia and these things still happen, irrespective of how much we all want them not to. So I thank them for their work and I put on record my thanks and gratitude for all that they do.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  I rise to speak in support of the measures contained in this bill, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017, which is the greatest crackdown on paedophiles in a generation. I have to agree with the member for Lindsay that we shouldn't do any political pointscoring on this issue. This is something that should be bipartisan. I have spoken about child sex abuse in this place many times, as someone who has family members who experienced it and because of my involvement with the apology to the 'forgotten Australians' and getting up the royal commission into sexual abuse and my continued ongoing patronage of CLAN and other organisations that support people who are no longer called the 'forgotten Australians' but referred to as survivors and also people who have experienced the horror of sexual abuse in institutions under the care of governments, churches and also private institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had a number of different jobs in my time. To this day being a dad to my son, Jarrod, is probably the most important job I have ever had in my life. I am sure that all members would agree with me when I say that to victimise and abuse a child is one of the lowest forms of human behaviour. The only other thing I could think of that would be worse, maybe, is murder. The welfare of the children in our society is paramount. I am proud to have been Jarrod's father. As parents we go to extreme lengths to ensure the safety of our children. From the day they enter our lives, we become their most fierce protectors and we do our very best to keep our little ones safe and secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in this job, as members of parliament, we have the capacity to extend these lengths to ensure the protection of every Australian child who doesn't have that protection, safety and security from their parents in their own homes and in our society. In my time as the member for Swan, child abuse is something that I have actively campaigned on. In my maiden speech I said I wanted to bring focus to the national issue of institutional child sex abuse and I shared the story of Shellay Ward, the seven-year-old girl who died in 2007 of starvation after years of abuse and being seriously neglected by her parents. What sort of society do we live in where a seven-year-old girl can starve to death under the nose of neighbours and the bodies that are set up by governments to protect children? Over the following 10 years, I have met with countless victims of child sex abuseâ€”victims who bravely gave evidence during the royal commission, victims who suffered at the hands of those who they trusted and victims who have spent their lives recovering from the trauma of their childhoods. This is why it is so important to support this legislation. I have seen adults who were abused as children collapse under the trauma of their abuse. They have been broken by their childhoods and many have had long battles with depression or addiction and have required ongoing medical assistance. Many of them have chronic health issues that they deal with on a daily basis. Others have tried to move forward with their lives but have shared with me the struggles they have endured, noting difficulties in all aspects of their livesâ€”in their work, in their relationships and when they have had children of their own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Child abuse hasn't just happened in institutions. It happens in children's own homes. It happens at the hands of guardians. It happens at the hands of strangers and online, as we have heard from other members who have contributed to this debate. It is not exclusive to any demographic, nor is it exclusive to any neighbourhood or region of our country. We have an entrenched system that is failing the children of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share with the House a couple of stories. I refer first to a story not in our country but in New Zealand with the story of two half-sisters, Saliel Aplin and Olympia Jetson, of Masterton, New Zealand. They were two beautiful girls who fell victim to the broken system that existed. Their story spans 10 years. There were 10 years where they could have been removed from the physical and sexual abuse they faced, but instead they were returned to their abusers again and again. Saliel was born in February 1989 and was the second child of Charlene Aplin. In November 1990, Charlene had Olympia Jetson, who was followed by two more children in the following two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1992, Charlene Aplin applied for a nonviolence order and spent time in a women's refuge. By 1993, Charlene had reconciled with her husband, but after further domestic violence and court involvement the marriage ended. At the end of the year, Charlene Aplin contacted police, concerned that the girls may have been suffering from sexual abuse. Evidence was inconclusive, and the girls received counselling. In 1994, Saliel and Olympia's elder sister repeated the sexual abuse allegations. Police were once more called, but no evidence was found. The counselling was continued. I saw a program on CI which featured this particular episode. These girls were submitted to a situation where they had to give evidence to the police in front of their abuser. Of course, they weren't going to reveal the details in front of their abuser. This is how ridiculous the system is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon after, Charlene Aplin began a relationship with Bruce Howse. In March 1994, Charlene Aplin contacted Child, Youth and Familyâ€”CYFâ€”and the police after a dispute between her and Howse. It is alleged Saliel and Olympia, at the ages of five and three respectively, had suffered injuries inflicted by Howse. In an interview the following month with CYF, the children reported physical abuse by Howse again. By the middle of May 1994, all Charlene's children were removed and placed with her parents. By the end of the year, Charlene reported to CYF that she was concerned that her parents were not caring adequately for her children. This woman complained her parents weren't looking after their grandchildren and she wanted to return them to an abusive situation. This is how silly our systems are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 August 1996, the court ruled that Saliel, Olympia and their brother could return to their mother and the abuser, Howse. By November, their eldest sisters returned to live with them and, by Christmas, Howse's five other children were also living with them. In April 1997, Charlene Aplin again took legal steps to protect herself from Howse, but soon the couple reconciled again. In October 1999, Charlene Aplin and Howse had a daughter. Domestic violence was reported to the authorities on several occasions and eventually Charlene left Howse and took all the children to her parents' home again, the home where she thought they weren't being looked after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2000, after living with her parents for six months, Charlene Aplin moved the family to Ashhurst, and Howse attempted to take the baby from the house. The police were called. A separate violent incident saw police called again. The family moved to Woodville briefly, before returning to Masterton, where Aplin again reconciled with Howse. At the end of September, Howse left home after a violent incident. Soon after, he returned home and abducted the baby. Charlene Aplin retrieved the child and further fights ensued before another reconciliation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2001, Charlene Aplin was pregnant again. She and Howse briefly separated but again reconciled. The pregnancy wasn't easy, and Olympia and Saliel were often left on their own in the care of Howse and their elder sister whilst their mother spent time in hospital. In July, another baby girl was born. After the following three months, on 3 August, Olympia's school contacted Charlene Aplin to say that Olympia had made an accusation of sexual abuse. By the following Monday, she had withdrawn that accusation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 20 November, a fight erupted between Howse and Charlene Aplin. The police were called and Howse was taken to his son's address. He phoned Charlene Aplin several times that night threatening to kill them all. He returned to the home the next day and was asked to leave permanently. Howse said Aplin had no legal right to keep him out of the house. On 1 September, Saliel had an argument with Howse and told him she was going to nark on him. Two days later, on 3 December 2001, Saliel and her little sister Olympia were stabbed. Each received a single knife wound. They both died in the early hours of 4 December, having bled to death, stabbed by their abuser, their stepfather. This followed a decade of physical and sexual abuse not by one but by two men. The system had failed them, and it fails so many children around Australia and in other countries around the world. This is why this legislation is what's needed to defeat these people, to put them away and to never let them have contact with children again. If I had my way, I would bring back capital punishment for people like that. This man got 28 years in jail. Hopefully he'll rot and die in jail, because that's what he deserves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Child sexual abuse is one of the most heinous crimes. To rob a child of their childhoodâ€”to abuse those too young to understand or those too afraid to say noâ€”is monstrous. I have another example. I met a woman who, from the age of eight to 14, was raped by her stepfather continually for six years. The only way they found out was the fact that she fell pregnant. This is back in the late seventies in Victoria. She was taken to court. It was one of the first ever sexual abuse court cases in Victoria. The stepfather got 2Â½ years jail. That is not satisfactory; that is not protection for children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long our laws have been inadequate. The bill introduces reforms which criminalise emerging forms of child sexual abuse and strengthen community protections from child sex offenders. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 targets all aspects of the child sex offender cycle by strengthening measures at the time of charging, bail, sentencing and upon release. Under the new laws, child sex offenders will spend longer in jail and will be less likely to be granted bail and parole. There has been some discussion that there shouldn't be mandatory sentencing. My support for mandatory sentencing for these people is absolute. They will face mandatory minimum sentences and be closely supervised following their release. They shouldn't be released. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The advancement of technology has seen emerging forms of child sexual abuse. These laws are adding an offence of providing electronic services to facilitate dealings with child abuse material. As it currently stands the code doesn't specifically criminalise the provision of electronic servicesâ€”for example, website or chat fora, often hosted on the dark webâ€”to facilitate online dealings with child abuse material. This amendment bill will make it an offence for a person to provide an electronic service with the intention that the service be used for access to child abuse material. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard some doubts in this area, in that teenagers might end up in jail. I can tell you a story about a young Aboriginal child in the north of Western Australia who lived in a community where his abusers were his own peers. He was seven and his abusers were 10, 11 and 12, and he was repeatedly raped by these abusers. It is in the environment where these kids live and grow up that we need to take hold of these situations and address these issues. This kid eventually became involved in a system that taught him self-respect, and the abuse stopped; he was so proud, and he wore a special T-shirt. Then the government withdrew funding for that program. It amazes me that as a society we can see something that is working successfully to protect children and then we withdraw funding that assists in those areas. If it takes emotion and the necessary hard line to protect children in our society, that is what we need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill also add an offence of grooming third parties using the post or a carriage service to procure children for sexual activity. These measures also clarify that live-streamed child abuse is captured in existing Criminal Code offences. Recently in the UK there was a story about people grooming children online. When the authorities got into the system, they found that over 3,000 children not only had been groomed online but had been blackmailed to take photos performing sexual acts for the people who put themselves up as their peers and friends online, and then they abused them. These men were all from the Middle East, aged from 21. This is the type of stuff we need to stop. The new offences will criminalise the transmission of communications using these services to a third party who is not the child victim, with the intention of making it easier to procure a specific child for sexual activity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's new laws ensure the sentencing of child sex offenders is reflective of the gravity of this type of offending. For too long we've read news stories of paedophiles being released on parole after a menial sentence that in no way represents the years of damage their actions have causedâ€”and there is a stat regarding the time they spend in jail. These new laws also increase penalties for certain offences, including grooming offences and offences for using a carriage service to engage in sexual activity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2012, only 58.7 per cent of those convicted of Commonwealth child sex offences have received a term of imprisonment. This will stop that. That 58.7 per cent of child sex offenders will go to jail. They need to go to jail. That's over half of those sentenced walking free after committing these types of crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing I'd like to thank the minister for bringing this legislation on a subject that is dear to my heart. My sister suffered sexual abuse and in the process died, when she was very young, at the age of 12. This is the type of thing we need. We need stronger laws and we need to be far more specific about what we are going to do with these people. I would like to thank those on the other side of the chamber who have supported this for the speeches and contributions they've made on this legislation as well. This is something that we can do as a parliament and as individuals.</span>

                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017. There is no-one in this chamber who wouldn't agree that the changes we're seeing in society, the changes we're seeing with the internet around child sex abuse and in making it easier for a lot of things to happen that have never happened before because the internet didn't existâ€”that all of this is really frightening. When my two children were young there was no access to the internet for them. There was no social media. In a very short time the online world has, sadly, made our children more vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is huge growth in the number of people who are viewing and sharing child abuse images. The volume is so large that the Australian Federal Police can't investigate and prosecute more than a very small proportion of the crimes. The AFP receive more than 10,000 reports of child sexual exploitation every year. That's the known number, but it would appear that children often do not report disturbing online activity, even when the offender attempts to contact them outside the internet. If we just look at online grooming, sexual solicitation incidents: in a significant US study, only one-quarter of the children who had encountered a sexual approach reported it to a parent, and only 10 per cent of approaches were reported to the police, to the internet service provider or to any other authorities, such as a teacher. Very little research has been undertaken on the impact on children of these attempted solicitations. The same study indicates that approximately a quarter of the children who had been solicited for sexual purposes reported being extremely upset or afraid, with younger childrenâ€”those 10 to 13 yearsâ€”reporting a greater adverse impact. In spite of that, they're not necessarily reporting what we all know is a crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similar findings have been reported in the small Australian survey of adolescent students. Only one-quarter of the children who had been sexually solicited told a parent. No reports were made to police. One-third of the children didn't disclose the solicitation at all. These studies, known as the Finkelhor and NAPCAN studies, provide support for the view that children often keep cyberfriendshipsâ€”that's the name they're givenâ€”a secret from parents and sometimes friends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is a crime happening there. We have a real problem. Sexual predators are making use of technology on apps that the rest of us use every day, like Snapchat, FaceTime and Skype. Not just Australian children, but children in countries all over the world, are victims of cyber sex abuse. The modern day patterns of behaviour and the use of technology that enable 21st century paedophiles and criminals to harm our children are a frightening evolution of these disgusting people. So reforms that target and punish the offenders are welcome in this bill. We will vote for this bill and wholeheartedly support the object of keeping children safe. There are many things we support in this bill, including the new grooming offences that are contained in it, and the clarification that this bill provides on the scope of some of the child sex offences that are contained in the Criminal Code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly support the change in terminology. As a former journalist I know words are not something that you take lightly. They have meaning and implications for people. I support the change in words to describe the material in question. 'Child abuse materials' is a much stronger phrase than 'child pornography', which doesn't recognise the seriousness and exploitation of these images. Children are harmed in their creation, but the abuse is repeated every time someone else views those photos, and each of those people should be punished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their efforts to be tough on the sexual predators of children, though, I think the government have failed to take the really tough steps that should be put in place for the sake of children everywhere. That's why we will move amendments in the Senate to ensure that the punishment fits the crime. We want to see higher maximum sentences. We believe courts should be able to lock up the worst offenders for life. Predators who go overseas to prey on vulnerable children should face tougher penalties. We want to see the laws better recognise and respond to the technological ability offenders have to watch child abuse remotely through webcams and live streaming, and are sure that this is as much a crime as being in the same room as a child who is being sexually abused. We want to see the people who incite or direct the production of child abuse materialâ€”for instance, in online chat roomsâ€”face severe penalties for encouraging people to do hideous things to children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see these people punished, we want them off the streets and we also want policies that work. Sadly, mandatory sentencing doesn't work, and I'm going to speak about that in a little bit more detail. There are a number of other amendments that we will move. As an example, we think that the defence based on a valid and genuine marriage, which currently exists for child sex offences, should be removed. Both the Law Council of Australia and Anti-Slavery Australia have called for this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I add that, if you're serious about protecting childrenâ€”which I believe everybody in this place isâ€”why would you slash the Australian Federal Police budget? They are already unable to investigate the reports that they get. The AFP suffered a $184 million cut in the last budget, and 151 AFP officers have been let go this year. Seriously, a bill won't make up for the fact that the capacity to enforce the law has been weakened by this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the issue of mandatory sentencing. We do reject the mandatory minimum sentences in this bill because they won't work and they lead to fewer convictions. And that's not something any of us want to see; we want to see more convictions. The government's own Attorney-General's Department says that mandatory minimums should be avoided, as they can create an incentive for defendants to fight the charges, even in clear-cut cases. What that means is that victims are more likely to need to go to courtâ€”to go through a torturous court processâ€”simply because of the application of mandatory minimum sentences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandatory minimum sentences also mean that there is less incentive for people to plead guilty or to provide information to the police. We need the people who are identified and caught to spill their guts about the other people who are involved in these heinous crimes. We need to have leverage to be able to get information out of them. This is not just me, the member for Macquarie, having an opinion. This is looking at the facts and the evidence, and what that evidence shows us is that mandatory sentencing does not provide that opportunity. Mandatory sentencing means there's less incentive for people to plead guilty, and the other side of it is that juries are less willing to convict. We see, time and time again, that juries are much happier to make a conviction. That's what the evidence shows. You need only talk to the Law Council of Australia to see that evidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lest there be any doubt about Labor's record in this areaâ€”and I would really urge the government to consider these things closely, not have some knee-jerk political reaction to themâ€”Labor always has and always will fight to protect children here and overseas from exploitation and abuse.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're proud of our record under Prime Ministers Keating, Rudd and Gillard, which included introducing world-leading offence categories targeting Australians who engage in sexual abuse of children. That was in 1994. We brought federal, state and territory governments together in 2009 to implement the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, which included a funding commitment of $63.6 million over four years from the Commonwealth government. We introduced new child abuse preparatory offences and other protection measures in 2010. We established the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the first inquiry of its kind at a national level. The royal commission, among other things, has inquired into how systems have failed to protect children and made recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to child sexual abuse that occurs in institutions. We appointed Australia's first National Children's Commissioner in 2013 to advocate for the rights of Australia's young people, and we introduced the vulnerable witnesses act in 2013. We are committed to doing everything that can be done to protect children from harm and abuse, and we wholeheartedly support the object of this bill. We have no tolerance for child sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time that remains, I would like for a moment to put aside the fact that mandatory minimum sentencing is an easy, populist, but costly and discriminatory, criminal justice policy that has never actually worked and look at the fact that mandatory minimum sentencing also ignores judicial discretion. Judicial discretion is at the heart of our criminal justice system. It allows the law to be applied to the immeasurable ways in which a crime presents itself. If we remove judicial discretion, we may as well give the gavel to a robotâ€”and yes, we're talking about child sex offenders. Unless those opposite have a crystal ball that allows them to know every way in which a crime will present itself, I think it is safer for us to look at the history of mandatory minimum sentencing and take our lessons from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been case after case where mandatory minimum sentencing has not worked. The impact of introducing mandatory sentencing for property offences in the Northern Territory in 1997 is an example of how vital judicial discretion is. I'm going to give you one example that unfortunately speaks volumesâ€”that of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy, Johnno, who stole pencils. He was taken from his remote community in the Northern Territory and imprisoned 800 kilometres away in Darwin. His mum had passed away when he was a baby, his father had been killed in a motor accident a few years prior, and at the time of his trial and sentencing his grandmother, who was his primary carer, was in hospital. But, in the hands of the jurisdiction with mandatory minimum sentencing, none of that could be taken into account. Johnno didn't need jail time to pull him into line. As it turned out, jail time in fact was the worst answer to this question. Five days out from the end of his sentence, Johnno hung himself with his bed sheet in his cell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't the same, and I know that those on the other side will say, 'Yeah, but that was pencils,' but this is a principle that runs through our legal system. Without the subjective guidance and discretion of judges we find ourselves in situations where kids are sentenced to jail for stealing pencils. The Law Council of Australia told the Senate committee inquiry that there would be similar unintended consequences. For instance, there could be conduct in a relationship between a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old where images are exchanged and sexual stories shared, yet the day the older partner turns 18 they could be liable for mandatory prison time. That is a potential unintended consequence of this legislation and a key example of why the Law Council opposes mandatory sentencing in all forms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I point out that the government's own Attorney-General's Department says mandatory minimums should be avoided. This is not political. Prominent Liberals, including former Prime Minister John Howard, members opposite and Senator Marise Payne, have expressed concern about mandatory minimum sentencing in the past. I urge the government not to play politics with this issue. We are on the same side. We all want to see harsher penalties. In fact, as our amendments that will be moved in the Senate will show, we want harsher penalties than those opposite want. Children are too important for there to be word games around this issue. The Labor Party is serious about justice for the victims of sex crimes and appropriate punishment for those who commit these crimes. Like those opposite, we have no tolerance for the sexual abuse of children. That is why each of us is standing here today proposing that this bill go further, that this bill be harder, because these crimes should be met with the harshest of sentences, and it is best that we leave the judges to do the judging.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  It's with a heavy heart that I rise todayâ€”not because I don't support this bill, but because we need to enact legislation to try to prevent child sexual abuse. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 represents tough new laws. It represents the greatest crackdown on paedophilia in a generation. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but I also say it takes a village to protect a child. I want to thank the member for Swan, and the previous speaker, for their contributions. The member for Swan's contribution was heartfelt and a significant contribution to the debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I address the House in relation to the specifics of this bill, I would like to recognise a campaign that is being run by YGAP. We held a morning tea for it in my office yesterday. YGAP promotes a campaign called Polished Man, which seeks to raise awareness of sexual and physical violence against children. We had a number of people from this House come to my office yesterday to support the Polished Man campaign, and I would like to point them out specifically. They were: the Chief Government Whip, Nola Merino; the <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation</span>, Angus Taylor; the member for Wide Bay, Llew O'Brien; the member for Bonner, Ross Vasta; the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson; the member for Dunkley, Chris Crewther; and the member for Mackellar, Jason Falinski. This is not just a 'this side of the House' thing. It was also supported by members opposite, for which I'm very grateful: the member for Burt, Matt Keogh, and the member for Macarthur, Dr Mike Freelander. Importantly, the Minister for the Environment and Energy was there, and, most importantly, the Prime Minister also came and showed his support. The Prime Minister said, 'As we know, not all acts of disrespecting women or children lead to violence, but that's where it begins.' This is about respecting the women and children in our lives and showing them love. That is when we are closest to being our very best and when we are closest to Godâ€”when we are showing love. All of us have a vested interest and a duty to look after all of our children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This event yesterday in my parliamentary office followed a similar morning tea that we had in my own electorate in Fisher, where I had prominent sporting men and businessmen attend the event, such as: Chris Flannery, the CEO of Sunshine Coast Falcons; Matt Soper-Lawler, the winger and top try scorer for the Sunshine Coast Falcons; Jack Hansen, the head coach of Alexandra Headland Surf Club; Ashley Robinson, the general manager of Alexandra Headland Surf Club and the chairman of the Sunshine Coast Falcons; Clayton Williams, a local businessman; and Peppi Bueti, a local businessman. The media got behind us as well, as they did yesterday. People like Danielle Ford, Dan Toney, Charles Hodgson and Hailey Francis painted nails to support the cause of Polished Man.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People might ask: 'Why polish a nail? What's that got to do with sexual assault against children?' I think it would be fair to say that most men don't walk around with a polished nail. The purpose of the Polished Man campaign is to engender a conversation, particularly amongst men, so that we can start to drive a culture in our country that speaks up against violence against childrenâ€”that we as men, in particular, say, 'Enough is enough.' It is utterly unacceptable for men to disrespect women and children by committing acts of violence against them and even more so when those acts of violence involve acts of sexual violence. For a person to have an instant moment of sexual gratification which will leave a child scarred for life, physically and mentally, is abhorrent and almost beyond words. What is it particularly about some men that they would rather put their own sexual gratification for a short moment above the life of a child who will carry that event with them for the rest of their lives? It's a rhetorical question, but I will never understand that attitude.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the World Health Organization, 150 million girls and 73 million boys worldwide under the age of 18 have experienced sexual violence. Just ponder on this: one child dies every five minutes around the world at the hands of an adult. That is part of the significance of Polished Man. We wear a polished nail on one out of our five fingers as one child dies every five minutes. All funds raised in the Polished Man campaign go to trauma recovery and trauma prevention programs for children who've suffered or who are at risk of suffering from violence and sexual violence around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the bill. This bill provides a comprehensive re-examination of the way in which we deal with those who commit the most heinous of crimes against our children. It amends various provisions that we currently have in our Criminal Code. It amends vulnerable witness protection measures to prevent children and other vulnerable witnesses from being cross-examined at a committal proceeding. We all knowâ€”well, some may not, but, as barrister of 16 years, I can tell youâ€”this is an experience that many children find harrowing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also seeks to introduce a presumption against bail for certain Commonwealth child sexual offences. If a person is charged with an offence against a person, there should be a presumption against bail. They should be in a show-cause position where they have to show cause for why it is that they should get bail. It is not a landmark concept. Offences of violence in Queensland put an accused person in a show-cause position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions include additional factors which must be taken into account when sentencing federal offenders to ensure they are appropriate, given the nature of the offending. They create a presumption in favour of an actual term of imprisonment. This amendment will ensure that, unless exceptional circumstances exist, all child sex offenders serve an actual term of imprisonment, rather than receiving sentences that are wholly or partially suspended. It requires that when a court is making a recognisance release order for a child sexual offender the offender be put under supervision, and it sets rehabilitation treatment as a condition unless it's otherwise inappropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions include a presumption in favour of cumulative sentences. Many in this place who aren't legally trained perhaps wouldn't understand that. For example, in the United States we hear about people serving multiple life sentences. In Australia, generally sentences are handed down concurrentlyâ€”it doesn't matter how many offences you commit; you generally get a sentence which reflects the one sentence. So, if you've committed five offences, you would generally only get a penalty as though it was one. That will not be the case under these provisions, and I think that that's a very good thing. Why do I say that? It is because, if an offender has committed an offence against, say, five or six children, and is sentenced as though it was one person, what does that say to the other four or five kids? What does that say to them? It really demeans the experience that they've been through. This amendment will provide greater disincentive, greater deterrence, for those committing similar offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions will list community safety as a factor that can be taken into account to revoke a federal offender's parole without notice. They will require a period of time to be served in custody if parole is revoked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions will also introduce mandatory sentencing for certain Commonwealth child sex offences. The office of the Commonwealth DPP has advised that it appeals a high number of child sex offence cases due to manifestly inadequate sentences imposed by judges at first instance and for repeat offences. Mandatory minimum sentences will apply to the most serious child sex offences. Mandatory minimum sentences reflect the heinous nature of child sexual abuse. The provisions introduce mandatory sentencing for repeat offenders. Mandatory sentencing schemes will also apply to child sex offenders who have previously been convicted of a child sex offence, including state and territory offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2012, only 58.7 per cent of convicted Commonwealth child sex offenders have received a term of imprisonment, and the average for those who do get a term of imprisonment is six months. This issue was raised, interestingly, by a very significant retired District Court judge, Judge Wall QC, who just last week criticised the recent sentences that were being handed down. He mentioned the case not of a child sexual assault but of a physical assault which led to the death of a child. He called them 'manifestly inadequate'. He also said that many of the judges of first instanceâ€”trial judges and sentencing judgesâ€”are concerned that, if they hand down too harsh a sentence, they'll be slapped down by the Court of Appeal. Whilst I am not a huge fan of mandatory sentencing in all cases, in this case it is called for. In this case, where we have the most heinous of crimes, we need to set a floor. We need to set a minimum so that judges can't go underneath that minimum. The Labor Party has itself supported mandatory minimum sentences in relation to child- and people-smuggling laws. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEENAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I thank all the members of this House who have contributed to this debate, and also colleagues on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who scrutinised the bill and recommended that it be passed. In particular I want to thank members who shared their personal stories and convictionsâ€”they have expressed a commitment to act against the scourge of child sex offending. However, it's important, if we're going to take action and if we believe that people who commit these crimes need to be appropriately punished, that all of this bill be passed. I genuinely thought that the parliament would come together and pass the totality of this bill in a bipartisan way. That was my expectation. That was what had happened when we announced that we were cracking down on child sex tourists and taking away their passports. Within two hours of our making that announcement, the Leader of the Opposition got up and pledged the Labor Party's support of that measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, after a month of prevarication, apparently the Labor Party is going to move to amend this bill in the Senate. By doing so they will cut out the heart of this bill, which is to make sure that people who are committing horrendous acts against children actually serve time in prison. I think most Australians would be pretty shocked to know that only 58Â½ per cent of those convicted of Commonwealth child sex offences spend any time in prison at all. That means over 40 per cent of Commonwealth child sex offenders never spend one day in prison. There's no such thing as a minor Commonwealth child sex offender. They are all horrendous offences. To deal with that and to make sure that people are getting appropriate punishments for the harm that they have caused, we will insist that the courts apply mandatory minimum sentences that reflect the gravity of the crime that has been committed. We don't believe that having over 40 per cent of convicted paedophiles spend not even a day in prison is acceptable. We don't believe that having the most common length of time served by those that actually serve a prison sentence be just six months is remotely acceptable. I'm surprised anyone in this chamber does, quite frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know that there's a problem with sentencing. It was confirmed by the High Court just last week in relation to a Victorian sentence, where they found that a sentence of three years and six months imprisonment for unprotected sex with a 13-year-old, which was based on other similarly low existing sentences for such crimes, was manifestly inadequateâ€”confirming, I might say, some of the criticism of lenient sentencing that has been made by members of the government. The opposition knows this. They know that mandatory sentencingâ€”I endorse what the member for Fisher was saying earlierâ€”is not an option we will use in all cases. We use it for crimes which the parliament thinks are particularly serious and where we need to send a signal that people committing these crimes must serve time in prison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've done it in this parliament in relation to people-smuggling. The opposition did it, when they were in government, in relation to people-smuggling. Astonishingly, members of the opposition who spoke in that debate in favour of mandatory sentencing are now speaking in this debate against it. This just shows that their opposition to mandatory sentencing is fickle and hypocritical. They introduced mandatory sentencing for people-smuggling when they were in office. We have mandatory sentencing for Commonwealth offences in relation to people-smuggling and we have mandatory sentencing in relation to terrorism offences. The opposition apparently has an ideological objection to mandatory sentencing. If they win next year's election, will they repeal mandatory sentencing for people-smuggling? Will they repeal mandatory sentencing for terrorism offenders? Apparently they've got some objection to mandatory sentencing in principle. Some quite extraordinary claims have been made in this debate that I want to particularly address to show you the furphy of this absurd ideological proposition against mandatory sentencing for paedophiles. It is an absolute nonsense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard in this debate that mandatory minimum sentences might make juries feel sorry for paedophiles who they think are guilty of crimes and then move to acquit. Well, I have a lot more faith than that in the common sense of the Australian people who sit on juries. I don't believe they'll be moved to feel sorry for people who have abused kids and therefore ensure that they don't serve time in prison. I think that is a ridiculous proposition, quite frankly. We have also heard that if mandatory sentencing were to be approved by the parliament it would be a disincentive for people to plead guilty. But that completely ignores the reality that we have inserted provisions within this bill that would give an incentive for an offender to plead guilty by an appropriate reduction in their sentence. And we've heard that the bill will reduce incentives to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, which again completely ignores the fact that there are provisions within this bill for an appropriate discount for the sentence when offenders have cooperated with law enforcementâ€”a discount of 25 per cent in both the cases I have just raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heardâ€”and this has been repeated ad nauseam by membersâ€”about this hypothetical case of an 18-year-old who apparently might go overseas and have sex with a 15-year-old, which completely ignores the fact that that is currently a crime. We're not changing the offences here; we're changing the way they are sentenced. Under current law it is, of course, a crime to have sex with somebody who's under the age of consent, which in most states is 16 years. Not only does this bill not apply to those under the age of 18 but the argument completely fails to take into account the safeguard that currently exists within the system that means we haven't seen cases like this prosecuted where it hasn't been predatory behaviour. It is that the AFP must make a judgement that it's in the public interest to investigate and prosecute a crime, and then the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions must do the same. They need to work out whether it's in the public interest for a prosecution to move forward. On a daily basis, they will make a judgement that a particular crime might not meet that threshold. The CDPP and the Australian Federal Police apply these discretions every day. So, regarding this hypothetical example, it's not a new offence. These offences could be prosecuted now. It's never happened before, because there's this discretion within the system. So, why would it happen moving forward? It is a complete red herring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is taking the global lead in making sure that in Australia tough penalties apply to people who prey on children. In a world's first, we have made sure that Australians who are registered sex offenders can't go overseas to prey on children, particularly here in our region. The oppositionâ€”to their credit, as I said in my opening remarksâ€”within two hours of our making that announcement pledged their support for that very important measure. These are world's-first changes, and the parliament, because we've got bipartisan support from the opposition, will pass them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in relation to this bill, there seems to have been a month of prevarication in which, apparently, the Labor Party, the opposition, were deciding on what they were going to do. Now they have come out on the side of some crazy left-wing ideology against mandatory sentencing, as opposed to joining with the government to send the message that the parliament finds these crimes abhorrent and, if you commit them, you're going to go to prisonâ€”something that is not happening now, because more than 40 per cent of convicted paedophiles don't spend a day in prison. That is unacceptable. Why do the opposition think that is acceptable? Why won't they join with us and support mandatory sentencing? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not going to tolerate people preying on our kids. The parliament has to send an appropriate message that the parliament won't tolerate it. I think we will be able to negotiate with the crossbench in the Senate to get this bill passed, because the crossbench is showing a lot more common sense than the Labor Party have been able to show. Apparently, what they are going to do when this bill reaches the floor of the other place is join with the Greens to gut it. They are going to join with the Greens to stop paedophiles from going to prison when they commit these horrendous crimes. I am astonished by that. The Labor Party should hang their heads in shame. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MACKLIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I am speaking today on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017. Labor will not support this unfair bill. It contains unfair cuts to the education entry payment, and it contains unfair cuts to the pensioner education supplement. We oppose this bill because it unfairly targets disability support pensioners, carers, single parents and jobseekers who take up study, and it will jeopardise their chances to continue their studies and find employment. Extraordinary really, isn't it, that this government is attacking people who are trying to do their best to improve their education? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time that the Liberals and the Nationals have tried to abolish or cut the education entry payment and the pensioner education supplement. Way back in the horror 2014 budget, the Liberals first proposed to axe these payments. They have tried for three years to destroy these payments. Three different ministersâ€”they keep changing the Minister for Social Services, and there is talk around that it might happen againâ€”have tried and failed to get it legislated. These cuts became part of this Liberal government's so-called zombie measures. Eventually, in the 2017 budget, after three years of failure, they gave up on some of the cuts, but not all of them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2017 budget papers, they listed the cessation of the pensioner education supplement, a cut of $272 million from the budget, as one of the zombie measures that they were removing from the budget. In that same list of zombie measures, in statement 3 of the budget, the cessation of the education entry payment was also listedâ€”or, so it seemed. But, of course, a leopard never changes its spotsâ€”particularly this lot. They hadn't given up. The Liberals brought back cuts to these payments, just in a slightly different form. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on data obtained at Senate estimates, there are 11,000 people receiving the education entry payment and around 37,000 receiving the pensioner education supplement. Around 9,400 people receive both payments and are at risk of being doubly hit by these unfair cuts. These payments are received predominantly by people with disability, carers, sole parents and the unemployed who have taken up study or training. I can't emphasise that enough: these are people who are trying their best to improve their education. Sixty-two dollars a fortnight might not sound like much to this Prime Minister, but it is, of course, to a single parent who is trying to find room in an already stretched family budget to afford textbooks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are sick and tired of the relentless cuts made by the Abbott-Turnbull government. They really have had a gutful from what I can only describe as this weak and lazy governmentâ€”weak because we know this leader has absolutely no authority, and lazy because they keep reproducing the same changes, year in, year out, that are so unfair, target vulnerable Australians and are very poor public policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of background, the education entry payment is an annual payment of $208 to assist certain social security recipients with the costs of education so that they can eventually re-enter the workforce. Recipients of Newstart, parenting payment single, disability support pension, special benefit carer payment and some other closing payments are eligible to receive the education entry payment if they're studying an approved course. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill creates a definition for 'normal amount of full-time study' and links the amount of education entry payment recipients can apply to receive to their study load based on the relevant percentage of full-time study or the amount of pensioner education payment supplement payable to the recipient. This calculation will be made with reference to the amount of full-time study for each individual course. 'Normal amount of full-time study' is defined in the bill as the amount of study that the institution offering the course considers to be full-time, or an amount of full-time study equivalent to the average amount of full-time study that a person would have to undertake for the length of the course in order to complete it in the shortest time possible; or, if the course is a course of study within the meaning of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and there are Commonwealth-supported-place students enrolled in the course, the full-time study load of the course. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new staggered payment rates in the bill are defined either by the percentage of full-time study being undertaken or by the corresponding amount of pensioner education supplement received. Where a person receives both the pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment, they face a cut to both. The current payment of $208 a year will continue for students studying at least 76 per cent of the normal amount of full-time study. The payment would then be reduced to $156, $104 or $52 in line with reduced study loads of 51 per cent, 26 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2016-17 financial year, as I say, around 11,700 people received the education entry payment. Of those, 4,805 were recipients of parenting payment single, 2,986 were recipients of disability support pension, 2,762 were recipients of Newstart and 826 were recipients of the carer payment. People on these payments are less likely than other students to be able to undertake studies full-time, as they often have health barriers or caring responsibilities that prevent them from doing so. This is a very important point to make, and one that seems to have escaped the government. These are vulnerable people who are often in difficult circumstances, seeking to improve their skills and improve their job prospects by undertaking some study. This is a very important point to make, and one that seems to have escaped the government. These are vulnerable people, often in difficult circumstances, who are seeking to improve their skills and improve their job prospects by undertaking some study. We hear all the time from those opposite, including the Prime Minister, that it's important to get social security recipients into the workforce, yet here they are cutting help that's designed to do exactly that. They are cutting support to these people who are taking a bit of a risk by doing some study in order to get a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note that the carer payment and parenting payment are paid overwhelmingly to women. Ninety-four per cent of the parenting payment's single recipients are women. Sixty-nine per cent of carer payment recipients are women. This means these cuts will disproportionately impact women who have started a course of training to get back into the workforce. It is unquestionably unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pensioner education supplement is a fortnightly payment to some social security recipients to assist with the ongoing costs of study. It was actually introduced back in 1987 by the Hawke Labor government. Currently the pensioner education supplement is paid at the rate of $62.40 a fortnight for a full-time student or $31.20 a fortnight for a part-time student. This bill cuts the pensioner education supplement during non-study periods. This will result in a cut for every recipient of the supplement, as it will no longer be paid in every fortnight of the year. The rate of payment will then be reduced to $46.80, then to $31.20 and then to $15.60 each fortnight in line with reduced study loads of 51 per cent, 26 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. To be clear, again: this is unquestionably a cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People with disability have statedâ€”and they've said this about the billâ€”that these cuts will hurt those on the lowest incomes, including people with disability, who will be further pushed into poverty and financial hardship. It will make it harder for people with disability to start or continue undertaking education. The St Vincent de Paul Society said it is 'cutting payments to those who need them most and reinforcing disparities in access to education.' Based on the latest available data, 37,717 people received the pensioner education supplement and, of these, 16,276 were recipients of parenting payment single. There were 15,430 people who were recipients of the disability support pension, 3,336 people who were recipients of the carer payment and 2,619 people who were recipients of Newstart. The Australian Council of Social Service estimates that 75 per cent of recipients of the pensioner education supplement are women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third area that is affected by this bill is the relocation scholarship. This relocation scholarship was introduced in 2010 by the Labor government to help students who need to move away from home for tertiary study with the cost of establishing accommodation. The scholarship was designed specifically to address barriers faced by students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly those in regional and remote Australia and Indigenous students. This bill proposes to cease eligibility for the scholarship for students who have both parents living outside Australia, students where their usual place of residence has been outside Australia within six months prior to claiming the scholarship or students who claim the scholarship to undertake study outside of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, on the one hand the Turnbull government says that they have given up on their unfair cuts; but we know, as this bill shows, that they are just waiting for the next opportunity. They just seem to want to rehash the old, unfair cuts from 2014, giving them a different name. By contrast, Labor stands for fairness. The Liberals and Nationals are all about unfair cuts. The pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment were both introduced to help vulnerable people with the costs of study so that they have the skills that they need to get back into the workforce. Cuts to these vulnerable people are unfair, and the bill should be opposed. Labor will oppose it. I urge the Senate crossbench to reject it as well.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I stand here today to support the previous speaker, the honourable member for Jagajaga. I also stand here to ask: when will it all end? When will the Turnbull government's relentless attacks on low-income Australians end? When will the Turnbull government's attacks on the most vulnerable people in our community end? When will the Turnbull government's attacks on regional, rural and remote Australian communities end? When will the Turnbull government stop attacking hardworking Australians who are just trying to get ahead? This is a government that kicks a person when they are down. Labor will not support these vicious attacks. What all Australians want is simply a fair go. They want a fair go to be able to travel for study should they need to because of where they live and/or the availability of relevant education and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government talks big about the importance of education and how it is funding the best education system for our children, but the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017 certainly does not support that view for our most vulnerable citizens. One of the key aims of the NDIS is to get people with a disability back into the workforce. If someone from the government could tell me how these cuts will help achieve that key aim, I would be truly grateful. A person's credit card should not determine their ability to access educational training at any age. But this is exactly what the Turnbull government is doing by cutting these vital assistance programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment were both introduced to help social security recipients meet the additional costs of study, which would enable them to get the skills that they need to get back into the workforce. These payments are received predominantly by people with disability, mental ill health, carers, sole parents and the long-term unemployed who have taken up study or training to better themselves. In the 2016-17 financial year, 11,662 people received education entry payment. Of those, 4,805 were recipients of the parenting payment single, 2,986 were recipients of the disability support pension, 2,762 were recipients of Newstart, and 826 were recipients of the carer payment. Recipients of these payments are far less likely than any other student to be able to undertake full-time study. The majority of recipients often have health barriers or caring responsibilities that prevent full-time study. The majority of these recipients are overwhelmingly the recipients of the parenting payment single, the carer payment and the disability support pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disproportionately, the carer payment and the parenting payment single are paid to women, where inequality in most areas is real. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that the changes in this bill will disproportionately impact on women. Ninety-four per cent of parenting payment single recipients are women, and 69 per cent of carer payment recipients are women. If you are a single parent, a person with a disability or a carer with a 50 per cent study load, you will receive a 50 per cent cut to your payment. I ask the Turnbull government: how is this fair? The restrictions around the definition in this bill are entirely unfair. The reality is this delivers a result where people will receive a 50 per cent cut. Also, there are some people who will be studying part time who will receive a 100 per cent cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the pensioner education supplement cut. Haven't pensioners already been hit hard by this government? Apparently not, because here comes another wave of attacks. The government's relentless attack on pensioners is completely unacceptable, unheard of and simply plain wrong. First, the Turnbull government wants people to work until they're 70. How is that fair for a roof tiler or a plumber or a concreter, for example? Let's not forget the fact that the government is also cutting the energy supplement. With soaring electricity costs, no renewable target or quality plan, how is cutting the energy supplement fair?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, this government is cutting the pensioner education supplement. The pensioner education supplement is a fortnightly payment for some social security recipients to assist with the ongoing cost of study. Currently, the pensioner education supplement is paid at $62.40 per fortnight for a full-time student or $31.20 per fortnight for a part-time student. This bill cuts the pensioner education supplement during non-study periods. This will result in a cut for every recipient of the supplement, as it will no longer be paid on a fortnightly basis each year. Pensioner education supplement recipients, like recipients of the education entry payment, are less likely than other students to be able to maintain their full-time study load, as I have already said, due to health barriers or caring responsibilities. If your study load is 75 per cent, you will be $15.60 a fortnight worse off. Like with the education entry payment, it is the most vulnerable people, once again, who are affected. In the 2016-17 financial year, 37,717 people received the pensioner education supplement. Of these, 16,276 were recipients of the parenting payment single, 15,430 were recipients of the disability support pension, 3,336 were recipients of the carer payment and 2,619 were recipients of Newstart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Council of Social Service estimates that 75 per cent of recipients of the pensioner education supplement are women. Women are already experiencing inequality relating to wages and superannuation, just to mention two areas. Women will receive the brunt of these harsh Turnbull government cuts. The changes in this bill will disproportionately impact women who have started a course or training to get back into the workforce. With little to no representation of women in the Turnbull government cabinet, of course the interests of women have been overlooked, and it is blatantly obvious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also around 9,400 people who currently receive both payments and are at risk of being doubly hit by these unfair cuts. This government has been trying to abolish the education entry supplement and the pensioner education supplement since 2014. Labor has been fighting to maintain these payments for income support recipients who are trying to achieve an education that will give them a better opportunity at a contributing life and some financial security from a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP are relentless in their attacks on our most vulnerable citizens. This is typical of the Turnbull government, which is either constantly underestimating the true cost of living for everyday Australians or they simply don't care. $62 per fortnight may not sound like much to this government, but it is to a single parent who is trying to find room in an already stretched family budget to afford textbooks. Let's revisit the cuts the Turnbull government has made to working families, single parents and pensioners: energy supplement, gone; family tax benefit, frozen; penalty rates, cut; pensioner education supplement, cut; and education entry payment, cut. In fact, the only two things that the Turnbull government has decided to increase are the working ageâ€”to 70â€”and a huge tax break for big business, which equals $65 billion. We know that the cuts to workers and families won't stop there, because you can't trust this government to look after anyone other than big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is even more outrageous is that the Turnbull government wants to get people off the social security system but at the same time will make the cuts to the very programs that assist people to get an education and to get ready for employment. This is just shameful. If the Turnbull government really cared about helping income-support recipients find work, they would stop trying to make it harder for them to just get through the day. Malcolm Turnbull says one thing and does another. Labor will always stand up for fairness. The Turnbull government want to make low- and middle-income Australians pay more so that their wealthy mates can pay less tax. They talk about a fair go, but that is not a fair go. It is not fair that big business gets a huge tax cut and a single parent gets a $62 cut to their education paymentâ€”a payment that assists them in getting employment and a better life for their family. It is not fair to also cut the energy supplement at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners, families and working Australians pay their fair share of tax and it is about time that big business did as well. The lowest income earners should not prop up the wealthiest. Until Chevron and Google start paying tax, they shouldn't receive any benefits from our taxpayer dollars. The benefits should go to the people who need them the most, and they are certainly not big business. Australians have had enough of the Turnbull government and their attacks on our most vulnerable citizens. You can only kick people when they are down for so long and then they will revolt. People will fight back. There will be a national revolt against this government, and, with 21 bad polls in a row, it appears that people are now making their point very clear as to where their vote will go at the next federal election. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I rise today to oppose the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017. This bill gives effect to two measures contained in the 2017-18 budget: 'better targeting of the relocation scholarship', and 'aligning the pensioner education supplement and education entry payment'. Currently, recipients of Youth Allowance and Abstudy payments are eligible to receive the relocation scholarship if they are moving to or from a regional or remote area to undertake study. Schedule 1 of this bill tightens eligibility for the relocation scholarship to students who are studying in Australia or whose family or usual place of residence is in Australia. Labor could potentially support this measure if it were separated from the other measures in the bill. The education entry payment and the pensioner education supplement are relatively small payments made to people with a disability, carers, single parents and jobseekers who take up study with the aim of improving their employment prospects and ability to support themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The education entry payment is an annual payment of $208 to assist certain social security recipients with the costs of education so that they can eventually re-enter the workforceâ€”upskill and participate. Recipients of Newstart, parenting payment single, disability support pension, special benefit carer payment and some closing payment recipients are eligible to receive the education entry payment if they are studying an approved course. It's particularly relevant that we're discussing this in a week that is both Anti-Poverty Week and Carers Week, given that both are affected by this piece of legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pensioner education supplement is a fortnightly payment to some social security recipients to assist with their ongoing costs of study. Currently, the pensioner education supplement is paid at $62.40 per fortnight for a full-time student and $31.20 per fortnight for a part-time student. Every fortnight, the recipient receives a payment from Centrelink. Schedules 2 and 3 of the bill remove eligibility for the education entry payment from recipients who undertake less than 25 per cent of the full-time study load, and progressively cut the amount payable under both payments for those undertaking between 26 per cent and 75 per cent of the full-time study load. The bill introduces a new schedule of payments for part-time study, resulting in some recipients being at least $15.60 a fortnight worse off. It also cuts the pensioner education supplement during long study periods, resulting in a cut for every recipient of the supplement. In pockets of my community where households are living on $600 a week and rental costs are now nudging $400-plus these changes are significant. They make a really big impact on people's budget and on their means for being able to actively participate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two measures are yet another example of this government slashing support to low-income and vulnerable Australians. This government continually says it is important to get social security recipients into the workforce. Only yesterday, while debating a matter of public importance, the member for Mitchell said this. Then we find ourselves considering a bill that cuts assistance to social security recipients who are studying so that they have the necessary skills to enter or re-enter the workforce. Actions speak louder than words. Over 11,000 people receive the education entry payment and almost 38,000 receive the pensioner education supplement. The overwhelming majority of people receiving these payments are parenting payment recipients, carer payment recipients and disability support pensioners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my previous role to this one, I was a pharmacist in a mental health unit in a public hospital. One of the things that people would commonly set as a goal, as part of getting well and staying well, was to pick up some study that they hadn't been able to finish, maybe go back to the trade that they had been doing, or perhaps go back to TAFE and finish that certificate they hadn't been able to finish. Because of their circumstances, these people were commonly recipients of disability support pensions. The changes being made in this area are significant to people in those situations. Part of getting well and staying well is being able to sit in a classroom againâ€”just doing things that many of us are able to do but that they've been excluded from doing or that they haven't been able to actively participate in. This is really central to somebody being able to get well and stay well and actively participate. The overwhelming majority of people receiving these payments are vulnerable people. The recipients of these payments are less likely than other students to be able to undertake full-time study, as I've discussed, because of health issues that they may experience or because of caring commitments they may have in supporting friends or family members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in this bill are likely to disproportionately impact women who have started a course of training to get back into the workforce. Over 90 per cent of parenting payment single recipients are women, and nearly 70 per cent of carer payment recipients are women. It's disappointing that the government no longer produces a women's budget to keep Australians informed of the impact of this type of measure on Australian women. From looking at comparable countries, we know that Australia has one of the most segregated workforces. We know that this is largely gender segregation. We've discussed, only this week, some quite prominent women and the real discrimination and gender inequality that still exists. These types of measures will only continue to perpetuate things that we should be redressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott-Turnbull government has been trying to abolish the education entry supplement and the pension education supplement since 2014. For three years, we've been fighting to maintain these payments for income support recipients trying to make themselves work-ready. But this government is relentless in its attacks on the most vulnerable. So, having failed to abolish them altogether, they're now cutting them from those who are not in a position to undertake full-time study: people with a disability, single parents, carers finding it hard to study full-time. I recently met a young woman who was enrolled in training to be a teacher. After her mum, who worked as a cleaner, was diagnosed with breast cancer, she found herself in a situation where she had to withdraw from study. These are the types of people who will be most impacted by these measuresâ€”people who are really struggling, who are really vulnerable. Sixty-two dollars a fortnight might not sound a lot to some people, but it is to a single parent who is trying, in an already stretched family budget, to find the means to afford textbooks, travel costs and childcare to enable them to study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can also look at this in the context of the proposed changes to enabling education, through Next Step and Open Foundation, where someone may be charged up to $3,200 for a university preparation course for people who otherwise wouldn't have the entry requirements. All of these things stacked up together just put another hurdle, another obstacle, in someone's path. I was recently talking to a friend of mine, Sam, who is now a speech pathologist and whose sister is training to be a teacher. She said she really noticed the impact on her sons of seeing her as a student. They could see that their mother was doing this and that it was something that they may be able to doâ€”something that otherwise would have been out of their reach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Prime Minister really cared about helping income support recipients find work, he would stop trying to make it harder for them just to get through the day or the next step. The pain doesn't stop there. A single mum working one shift a week has just had her family tax benefit rate frozen, and she's probably just lost her penalty rates. This has affected a mum that I met with. She had a young daughter and she was working evenings, because that was the time that her mum was able to look after her daughter, which meant that she had the ability to work which she otherwise wouldn't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals say that they have given up on their unfair cuts, but we know they're just waiting for the next opportunityâ€”and here it is. Cuts to the pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment are just part of a whole raft of government cuts to education, cuts to universities, higher student fees and harsher repayment requirements for student loansâ€”you'd almost think that the Prime Minister doesn't want disadvantaged Australians to be able to access education to improve their circumstances, because he's saying one thing and doing another. He says it's important to get social security recipients into the workforce, yet he's cutting assistance which is designed to do exactly that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always stand up for fairness. Labor will always stand up for education. The Liberals want to make low- and middle-income Australians pay more so their wealthy mates can pay less. It's just not fair. These measures particularly affect vulnerable people in regional areas. These measures are expected to save the government $96 million over five years. That might sound like a big number, but it's less than the cost of the same-sex marriage survey, and it's a very small number compared to the annual cost of negative gearing and the capital gains tax concessions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mental health worker and a pharmacist and someone who has worked with vulnerable people for most of my life, I have spent a lot of time working with social workers who are struggling to help people find a place to live and acquire the skills that they need to participate in the workforce and look after their families. I find it really distressing that these cuts are cruelly targeted at some of the most vulnerable people in our communityâ€”people that I've spent my life working with and caring for. The strain on them and their families, particularly young carers, is something that's not often recognised: the caring role that young people have and find themselves in in families. Young carers are ones who are likely to be particularly affected by these changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, these measures are expected to save the government about $96 million over five years, which really, in terms of the government's budget, says a lot about its priorities. Governments set the priorities and budgets are about that. This government, over and over again, is targeting the most vulnerable people and the most disadvantaged pockets of our communityâ€”and it is doing it in a really callous way. But I can tell you a big number: $62 a fortnight is a big number to someone on an income of around $450 or $500 a week trying to meet the cost of study to better themselves, to improve their family's circumstances and to boost their chance of getting a job in what is a really competitive job market. In communities like mine, youth unemployment sits stubbornly high. The latest figures show it at 17.3 per cent, in a community where one in two adults have had the opportunity to have a post-school education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talks about choice, but choice is a privilege. In this situation, we're taking from people who don't have the privilege of choice and who haven't had these opportunities that those on the other side may have enjoyed. The Liberals should stop expecting the lowest-income Australians, the most vulnerable people, those living in disadvantaged communities, to subsidise the wealthiest and the most affluent in our community. They should stop putting barriers in the way of carers, people with a disability and single parents who are using their initiative and using the education system to fight their way to a better life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Michelle, in my electorate, is a nurse. This year she was recognised as the Wyong Hospital Nurse of the Year. She was someone who went through the Open Foundation pathway. Our community would be so much worse off if we didn't have people like Michelle, working as a nurse in Wyong Hospital, or people like my friend Renee, who is in a similar situation. On this side we all know someone who has had the benefit of this and whose families have changed because of this. It can transform lives. The government must stop putting barriers in the way of carers, of people with disability and of single parents who are trying to access the education system, which has been stacked against them, to find a way to a better life.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I'm pleased to rise on this side of the House and follow the member for Dobell and other colleagues. Once again we on this side of the chamber find ourselves standing, speaker after speaker, representative after representative, to defend the most vulnerable and defend the principle of the fair go in this country. We believe that Australians should be given every opportunity to be educated, to make a contribution, to join the workforce and to live a life of paid work, of dignity. On this side of the chamber we are again defending those positions. It's important to note that, upstairs in the Federation Chamber, speaker after speaker from this side of the chamber are talking about a $65 billion tax cut for the top end of town. It's important that people in my electorate understand that, in Canberra, on this side of the chamber, we are here on our feet defending them. We are upstairs on our feet trying to stop the largesse to the big end of town, while others of us are here protecting the most vulnerable in our communities and protecting their rights to educate themselves and to become part of the working part of society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this legislation in front of us passes this House and the other place, it will be another example of the compounding cuts and measures taken by this government in budgetary processes to determine that people who may not have had the best start, may not have finished their education, or whose lives may have been interrupted by any number of thingsâ€”having a family, caring for parents who are sick or vulnerableâ€”should have their opportunities reduced once more. We have been in this battle now since 2014. I am reminded of a conversation with a single mother in Little River. The member for Kingston, who is in the chamber today, was there and will remember this well, when we were talking about the cuts to Little River Primary School's out-of-school-hours care. That day we met a young mum, engaged in tertiary education, who beautifully explained that, wherever she turned, her chances of finishing her educationâ€”so that she could get full-time employment, break the cycle and ensure her children saw her in full-time workâ€”were being slashed by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are again with a further cut that means that this government has gone out to find themselves a few pennies. Upstairs we're looking at a $65 billion tax cut for the top end of town; down here we're talking about a $68 potential cut to some of our most vulnerable who are trying to undertake study. I'm reminded also of the young carers that we met this year. The minister responsible for this piece of legislation, the member for Pearce, is in the chamber now. He was in that meeting that day, where we met young carers caring for parentsâ€”some from my electorateâ€”who were talking to us about how difficult it was for them to continue their education while they undertook those caring responsibilities. We heard about scholarships and bursaries that some of those young carers were fortunate enough to receive to assist them to study, but the young person from my electorate was not a recipient of a bursary. Her opportunity to engage in and finish her TAFE course was reliant upon the exact measures that this piece of legislation would now limit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put it this way: as an example, say a young person who is a full-time carer for a parent who is disabled and unable to care for themselves is engaging in education in a part-time capacity. That person would now have the assistance that had been given to them by the government, to overcome the hurdles put in front of them, reduced by this piece of legislation. It is an indictment of this government that it brings this legislation into this place on the same day it is seeking $65 billion worth of tax cuts for the big end of townâ€”an absolute shame. Again, who are the recipients here? Who are those who receive both of the measures I am most concerned aboutâ€”the pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment? The education entry payment is $208 a year for those studying full-time. When I talk to people they tell me it is already incredibly difficult, that it's only for approved courses and that the hurdles you have to jump in the application process result in discrepancies. There are 37,000 people who receive the pensioner education supplement and only 11,000 people who get the education entry payment. It's already difficult, as reflected in those numbers. Why would you want to make it more difficult? Why would you want to exclude people from getting that $208?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also this paring back, saying, 'If you're not studying full-time, you're going to get less support.' We're talking about people in my community who may be travelling and trying to put petrol in a car to engage in study and who take that cost out of the single parent support payment, the disability support pension, the carer payment or Newstart. So we've got a structure here that supports people to engage in education, and those opposite are determined to tear it down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In every sense, it's another attack on education in this country. It's another attack on people who are trying to lift themselves up, when those opposite claim that that's what they're all aboutâ€”that they're all about freedom, they're all about the individual, they're all about people being able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and climb the ladder of opportunity. Yet here they are, in this chamber today, acting to undercut that and put more hurdles in front of those same people. We know from the figures thatâ€”surprise, surprise!â€”94 per cent of recipients of parenting payments and 69 per cent of recipients of carer payments are women. And we know that withdrawing support from women is going to see women less likely to continue in their education and less likely to join the workforce full-time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talks, and newspaper articles are released. The member for Pearce and others on that side release data on different communities, trying to stigmatise them about the levels of welfare being paid to them. They release this data all the time. Well, they need to understand that when you undercut people's ability to climb that ladder of opportunity, when you undercut their ability to engage in meaningful education, you're going to create a larger cost somewhere else. It doesn't even make economic sense to put things in place that will reduce the chances for women in electorates like mine to engage in education and to find themselves full-time, meaningful work so they can raise their family with less support from government. This is about opportunity, and it's about the rug of opportunity being pulled out from under people in communities like mine. Labor will alwaysâ€”alwaysâ€”work to ensure that everyone can access what they require to ensure that they can have a meaningful life and find employment. But this is a government that talks about jobs and growth yet is tearing down people's capacity to get those jobs. It is extraordinary to be in this chamber today and have these measures before us. It really is about penny-pinching. We are not talking about an extraordinary amount of money here. It is not going to save the budget an enormous amount of money. But it is going to cost the people who are currently being supported to study; it is going to cost them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fear for me and my community is that, there will be young people, there will be people in their 30s and there will be people on a disability support pension who will disengage from education as a result of this piece of legislation. Never forget that the education entry payment and the pension education supplement are most commonly paid to recipients of the parenting payment, 94 per cent of whom are women. As someone who worked in education for many years, I was aware of circumstances where young girls became parents and perhaps were at home under the parenting support payment, isolated with a young child and not necessarily engaging in education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an educator in the schools I worked in, we made sure we reached out to those young people and got them back working and trying to engage in their education. That's what it's supposed to be about. This piece of legislation will limit their capacity to engage in education. How anyone with an ounce of common sense could think that this is sensible is beyond my understanding. I would think that this government would want to do everything in its power to support those young women to ensure that they continue their education as they raise their small child and to ensure that, when that child went to school and when that child reached the age where government support could be withdrawn from them, they have skills and training that will be readying them to join the workforce full time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of that study is obviously going to be part time. Obviously, it's going to be part time. The thought that everybody who studies needs to be doing it in a full-time capacity is extraordinary, particularly under these circumstances. There are people on the disability support pension, and people who have limited capacities in their life due to health issues. In my community, most understand the level of incapacity required for people to access the disability support pension. The thought that unless they are studying full time they're going to have support withdrawn from them is extraordinary. If someone is on the disability support pension, they have an incapacity. If they are, in those circumstances, engaging in education, that is something that this country should be celebrating and something that those opposite should be celebrating. It's about getting prepared. It's about leaving the door open for a potential return to work. It's about ensuring that their lives are meaningful and that they are engaged, outside their own homes, with the rest of the community. It makes not just economic sense for these supports to be in place but also social sense for these supports to be in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will remind the House that we're here in this chamber acting to support the most vulnerable in our communities and their right to support to ensure that they can stay engaged in education to maximise their capacity to build skills so that they can get full-time employment. While we're here defending that, we're also upstairs presenting a case against a $65 billion tax cut. The contrast couldn't be clearer between what this side of the House care about and what those opposite see as this country's future. To put it simply, we are talking about withdrawing support from people who are actively engaged in accessing education to better their circumstances. We are talking about withdrawing that support so that we can give tax cuts to the top end of town and so that this government can entrench the inequality that we have been confronted with. In a time where inequity is at a 70-year high, we're here quibbling over withdrawing the support that would see many people in my electorate lose their connection to education and perhaps lose hope in their future.</span>

                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I rise to speak against the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017 and to strongly support the amendments moved by the member for Jagajaga. I thank the member for Lalor for her contribution to this debate. Like the member for Lalor, I absolutely condemn the Abbott-Turnbull government for their persistent attacks on vulnerable Australians. It is disgraceful and, dare I say it, un-Australian. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of background, let's look at the real people this government has in its firing line. The payments the Turnbull government is proposing to cut are predominantly received by people with a disability; by carersâ€”I mention that in National Carers Week; by single parents or jobseekers; and by people who have taken up study or training to ensure they have the skills they need to secure long-term employment in a very competitive workplace. You often hear the government hyperventilating at the dispatch box about breaking the cycle of welfare dependency. I agree that that is a good thingâ€”Labor always agrees that a job is the best thing to give to somebody. I mention the member for Lilley, who has been talking about this for a long time in both books and his policies as Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. We saw that in Prime Ministers Gillard, Rudd, Keating and Hawkeâ€”they always focused on giving jobs to the greatest number of Australians while recognising the reality of the Australian workplace. So I can tell the government something for free: slashing the payments of Australians undertaking study or training to achieve workplace readiness is not how you break the cycle of welfare dependency; in fact, it only entrenches the dependency. These changes will do exactly the opposite of what the Turnbull government purports to achieve. Your credit card should never determine your ability to get a better education. Labor knows this and will always stand up for you. Labor will always stand up for fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the payments this bill seeks to change is the education entry payment, the EEP. This is an annual payment of $208 to assist certain social security recipients with their education costs so they can eventually re-enter the workforce. Recipients of Newstart, parenting payment single, the disability support pension and the carer payment are currently eligible to receive the EEP if they are studying an approved course. In the 2016-17 financial year, 11,662 people received the education entry payment. Of those, 4,805 were recipients of parenting payment single, 2,986 were recipients of the disability support pension, 2,762 were recipients of Newstart and 826 were recipients of the carer payment. The bill introduces the definition of a normal amount of full-time study but completely ignores that recipients of this payment are less likely than other students to be able to undertake studies full time, as they often have health barriers or caring responsibilities that prevent them from so doing. The overwhelming majority of recipients are single parents or recipients of the carer payment or DSP. Disproportionately, the carer payment and parenting payment single are paid to women. This bill will disproportionately disadvantage women, as 94 per cent of parenting payment single recipients and 69 per cent of carer payment recipients are women. I cannot support this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also seeks to change the pensioner education supplement, which is a fortnightly payment to assist with the ongoing costs of study. Currently the pensioner education supplement is paid at $62.40 per fortnight for a full-time student or $31.20 per fortnight for a part-time student. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that Prime Minister Turnbull doesn't understand real cost-of-living pressures. I would suggest, sadly, that he never has and never will. He tells the old battler millionaire story about the childhood in which, we're supposed to believe, he came up as some sort of battler, forgetting the fact that he had a privileged upbringing and nothing but a positive experience in childhood and was given every opportunity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill caps the PES during non-study periods. This will result in a cut for every recipient of the supplement, as it will no longer be paid in every fortnight of the year. PES recipients, like recipients of the EEP, are less likely than other students to be able to maintain a full-time study load, due to health barriers or caring responsibilities. Where a person receives both the pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment, they face a cut to both. In the 2016-17 financial year, 37,717 people received the pensioner education supplement. Of these, 16,276 were recipients of parenting payment single, 15,430 were recipients of the disability support pension, 3,336 were recipients of the carer payment, and 2,619 were recipients of Newstart. ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service, estimates 75 per cent of recipients of the pensioner education supplement areâ€”you guessed itâ€”women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final payment this bill seeks to change is the relocation scholarship payment. This was a payment designed by Labor in 2010 to address the barriers faced by students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly Indigenous students and those coming from regional and remote Australia. I wonder where the National Party are when it comes to standing up for kids from the bush? Yet again, the National Party has gone missingâ€”missing in regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government cannot unite their own party on policy but they can unite one specific group in the community, the experts. Nearly every piece of policy they bring into this House is against the united advice of experts. I have heard them recently talk about expert advice. I wish they would listen to experts when it comes to social policy. This piece of legislation, yet again, is no differentâ€”they're ignoring the experts. ACOSS has opposed the bill. In relation to the relocation scholarship payment, they say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ social security payments should be paid on the basis of financial need and not guided by arbitrary conditions. This cut does not stand up to that test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Social Security Rights Network is opposed to each of the measures in the bill. In relation to the relocation scholarship eligibility changes, they say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Relocation Scholarships should be available to all low-income students who move away from home to study regardless of the location of the family home or where the student chooses to study. This is consistent with the original intention of the payment and provides support on an equitable basis. The scholarship should respond to the need of support to the costs of moving away from home without additional restrictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other groups in the community who would be impacted by these cutsâ€”groups that already live with hardship on a day-to-day basis. These cuts may make it so difficult for them that they can no longer study, although study is always going to be the way to move off welfare. One of these groups comprises the unsung heroes of our community, our carers. Some carers take on study whilst caring for someone in their life. That allows them to return to the workforce when they are no longer needed in a caring role. Carers Australia opposes the changes to the PES and EEP. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the amount of EEP and PES payments based on small changes in course loads, and suspending payments during semester breaks and holiday periods, as proposed in the Bill, will adversely affect the capacity of carers to continue their studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another group who will be substantially affected by these cuts, sadly, are people with disability. People with Disability Australia, also an expert group, are opposed to the changes to the PES and the EEP. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the Bill is passed those on the lowest incomes, including people with disability, will be further pushed into poverty and financial hardship. It will make it harder for people with disability to start or to continue undertaking education. Plans to cut these payments are counter to the Government's focus on increasing employment opportunities through education. Whilst expectations for pensioners to undertake education increase, the very means of supporting access to education for pensioners are being cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rightsâ€”I see the chair of the committee is here in the chamberâ€”I have scrutinised this bill from a human rights perspective. The committee raised concerns about the cuts to the relocation scholarship. The committee report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ â€˜simplifyingâ€™ and â€˜streamliningâ€™ do not constitute legitimate objectives for the purposes of international human rights law and do not acknowledge the extent of the payment reduction. Rather, a legitimate objective must address a pressing or substantial concern, and not simply seek an outcome regarded as desirable or convenient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This out-of-touch Turnbull government consistently puts before this House policy which disproportionately and adversely affects the most vulnerable in our society, at the same time as it's rolling out a tax cut for the top end of town. The harbourside mansion focus of this government is disgusting. This legislation falls again within those parameters. What is most disappointing and difficult to reconcile with good policy is that these cuts will stop young Australians, Australians who are carers and Australians who suffer a disability from further educating themselves. It will stop them from being able to enter or return to the workforce. This is bad policy. It is policy without a soul. I do not support this bill. I do not support this legislation. No intelligent, caring politician could.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  Like the member for Moreton, I too for a number of reasons will not support the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017. Firstly, this bill targets womenâ€”75 per cent of those people receiving the benefits that this government seeks to cut will be women. I can understand that the government might not understand that. They don't have a very long list of speakers, or in fact anyone in here, to defend it because they probably don't understand what it's like to be a woman. They don't have a high representation of women. But 75 per cent of the people affected by this are going to be women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, is at it again. What does he have against battlers? That should be the question we are all in here talking about. What does he have against people who are trying to study and are already doing it tough? This is a fundamentally unfair bill. As the shadow minister, Jenny Macklin, has already told this House, we will absolutely not support it. This bill contains changes to the eligibility requirement of the relocation scholarship, the education entry payment and the pensioner education supplement. As the member for Moreton asked: where are the Nationals on this? Why aren't they in here? The bill cuts the requirements of eligibility for the relocation scholarship, which will mostly affect kids from the bush.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been fighting to maintain all of the payments that will be cut by this bill. Those students are struggling enough as it is. They are income support recipients making themselves ready for work. If Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of this country, actually cared about helping income support recipients find work instead of demonising them on the front pages of the tabloids, he would stop trying to make it harder for them to just get through their day. The Liberals are relentless in their actions and their attacks on vulnerable people, and this bill shows the Prime Minister yet again trying to slash support to low-income Australians. This is very, very typical behaviour, though. He is constantly underestimating the true cost of living for everyday Australians. I am just here to put on the record for him, again, that the cost of living is three per cent higher in Western Sydney, in the seat I represent, than it is in Sydney. I am not going to go into the details of why that is, but I suggest he does some further reading on the comparative costs of living for harbourside mansions and battlers in Western Sydney. He is saying one thing and doing another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts are unfair to the students receiving an education entry payment. These students are eligible for the payment if they are in an approved course and are a recipient of Newstart, parenting payment single, the disability support pension, special benefit or a carer payment. In 2016-17, about 11,700 people received the education entry payment. I would put to anybody that that is not a huge number of peopleâ€”11,700 people, in some of the most vulnerable positions in our community, are recipients of this payment to help them get ahead. This is what this payment is for. They are in study. They are doing everything we're asking of them. They are trying to better themselves. What are the government doing? They are going to cut them down. They are casually going to come along and take some money off them, saying: 'It won't matter to them. What would they notice? How will that affect them?' Of those 11,700 people, 4,805 were recipients of parenting payment single. Let me tell you from firsthand experience about being a single parent. It's tough. It's hard work. Some 2,986 were recipients of the disability support pension, 2,762 were recipients of Newstart and 826 were recipients of the carer payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as being a single parent, I'm also the carer of a child with a disability. So let me tell those people opposite, because clearly they've missed the empathy gene on the way out the door before being given birth to, it is really, really hard work to be a single parent and to be a single parent of a child with additional needs. It takes an enormous amount of additional time, energy and resources. Making a cut to something that is trying to support them is inhumane. I note that those opposite also have no problem coming along to Carers Week events, posing for photos, wearing badges and espousing the importance of all the unpaid work done by carers, but, when it comes to actually supporting the work of carers through something like this, they've left the building.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, 115 people received the education entry payment in the 2016-17 financial year to September 2016. The government likes to talk about corporate tax cuts and the now very discredited trickle-down economics, but the very people they say will benefit from this measure are the people they are penalising with the measures they have on the table now. And all this is to what end? I think the member for Warringah and his mates who are on the other end of the spectrum to where we sit are certainly going to be appeased by measures like this. Cutting the education entry payment will make things more difficult for students. The effect of this bill is that every student who is currently eligible for the education entry payment will be subjected to criteria to determine the level of their study loadâ€”from 25 per cent to full-time study. The education entry payment is an annual payment of $208 to assist with the cost of education. Depending on the determination of a student's study load, up to full time study, the recipients of the education entry payment could receive a cut of $52, $104 or $156, or it could be cut entirely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does the Prime Minister know how much a textbook costs? In my electorate, at the Western Sydney University Penrith campus in Kingswood students enrolled in the engineering materials course are prescribed by their lecturers <span style="font-style:italic;">Fundamental</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> of Materials Science and Engineering</span>. A brand-new copy of that textbook costs $196â€”let's just call it 200 bucks. Second-hand, you can pick one up for $152. If the Prime Minister was studying engineering materials, he could easily afford, from his harbourside mansion, a hundred new copies of this bookâ€”a thousand new copies! But for a student on a supplement studying one subject and facing these cuts, the cost of this textbook could be the making or breaking of someone studying that course. Again in Western Sydney, students studying enterprise law are prescribed by their lecture a business and law textbookâ€”$137 for a brand new one and 110 bucks for a used one. The $1.75 million donation that this Prime Minister made to the Liberal Party at the last federal election to secure his own job would have purchased a whole lot of those textbooks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise Western Sydney University because 60 per cent of students at that universityâ€”of which I'm proudly an alumni memberâ€”are first in family. Sixty per cent of those students are the first in their family to have the privilege to attend university. Fifty-seven per cent of their students are female, 37 per cent are from linguistically-diverse backgrounds and 25 per cent are low socioeconomic students. For the battlers who are struggling to make ends meet, who are on Newstart, living with a disability or caring for someone, it is a massive, massive whack to their budget, and it is fundamentally unfair. This is more of the same of what we've seen from those oppositeâ€”pushing the cost of education onto the student and making it more and more difficult to study. We should be supporting students because they're having a go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts are unfair to students receiving the pensioner education supplement. Almost 38,000 get the pensioner education supplement, and of those receiving that supplement 4,805 were recipients of the parenting payment and are single parents, 2,986 are recipients of the disability support pension, 2,762 are recipients of Newstart and 826 are recipients of the carer payment. That's a lot of people who are trying to study; that's a lot of people who could be affected by these cuts. To be eligible to receive the pensioner education supplement, a student needs to meet the study rules and already be receiving one of the payments outlined. These people are trying to study either full- or part-time at a secondary school or completing an undergraduate degree, a TAFE course for a diploma or a graduate masters course. These payments are predominantly received by people with disabilities, carers, sole parents and unemployed people who have taken up training or studyingâ€”which is exactly what we should be imploring them to do and supporting them as they do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, in September, 391 people were getting the pensioner education supplementâ€”that is, 391 people who are already doing it tough, relying on our social services safety net. The government wants to take away the supplement from these students. We are, in my electorate, battlers. We are strong. We are 'have a go' people. We don't sit around and expect people to do things for us. We get out there and have a crack. I often speak in this place about how good and how salt of the earth the people in my community are. These students in my electorate do not need more cuts from this government. They are single parents, people with a disability, people looking for work, and carers. Let that sink in. The people who are in receipt of this kind of payment are exactly the people that this country and this government should be supporting. They are struggling to stay studying. We want them to stay studying. We want them to have a better life. We want them to do better. We want their kids to do better. They already have barriers to study and work such as health issues, caring responsibilities or simply being on a low income. These cuts are just going to make it more difficult and put more hurdles and more barriers in place. Their studies could lead to a better job and a better life and improve their wellbeing. Now the Turnbull government and all of those people who support this legislation want to make it more difficult for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the proposed changes to the pensioner education supplement, these people will be paid only during study periods and not during their semester breaks or holidays. We have what I would term 'semester breaks' from parliament. Imagine if you said to all the MPs here: 'You're not going to get paid during those breaks. You're only going to get paid when you go to Canberra.' We know that a lot of work is done when we are back in our electorates, but we're on a break from parliament, and these kids are on a break from school or study. The government is going to stop these supplements during that period of time. Imagine you are a low-income earner and studying and you are already struggling to pay bills, but because the semester or term has ended that payment stops. That reliable income that you have budgeted for is not there. These people often have jobs as well while they are studying. When I went to university I had four jobs in my first, second and third years at university. I had four casual jobs to pay my rent and car payments, and it was just enough to make ends meet. Working and studying was a huge load, but I did itâ€”and I did it with the help that I was able to receive. We know that the bills don't stop coming in those semester breaksâ€”the rent still needs to be paid and the lights still need to workâ€”so why would we stop the payment to these students during their semester breaks? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts are cruel. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says that he wants people to find a jobâ€”tick; that's great. A fundamental thing for everybody is to have a job, but it makes it more difficult to study. The thing that we know will improve our chances of finding a job is education. I think I have even heard the Prime Minister say those things himself. These cuts will affect the students who are already doing it tough to get a better life. Not only that but the Australian Council of Social Service estimates that 75 per cent of pensioner education supplement recipients are women. The changes in this bill will disproportionately impact women who have started a course or are training to get back into the workforce. Women are traditionally, as we are very well aware, the primary caregivers. Time and time again we see people in Western Sydney who dragging themselves up by their bootlaces being unfairly targeted as not worthy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment were both introduced to help social security recipients with the cost of studying. The Liberals have been trying to abolish the education entry payment and pensioner education supplement since 2014. The education entry supplement and the pensioner education supplement are commonly paid to recipients of parenting payment single, 94 per cent of whom are women. Women are already subject to great gender bias in Australia. I'm really looking forward to coming in here the next time this parliament sits and, as we come to White Ribbon Day, watching everybody march out their white ribbons, roll up their sleeves and say, 'What great people we are.' When you are just out there as a talking head and are not actually interested in doing the work that goes on to bridge some of the gender gaps in this country, it is easy. But the action required from this government is seldom there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The slashing of penalty rates also disproportionately affects women. Women face the discrimination of a gender pay gap of 16 per cent in pay rates and hiring, women attract lower wages and carry the load of unpaid caring and domestic work, and women are over-represented in lower paid industries. They are a third more likely to be underemployed and more likely to be employed as casual workers in insecure jobs. We've had a case this week highlighting the gender pay gap. One of our very high profile and esteemed women in the media, quite intelligently and cleverly, has really taken a stand; and congratulations to Lisa Wilkinson. This is why I'm up here talking about the gender pay gap.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around Australia, 9,400 people receive both payments and are facing the government's cruel and unfair cuts. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee received a submission from People with Disability Australia and their CEO, Steph Gotlib. In their submission, which succinctly summarised the substantial financial hardship people will face under this bill, they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the Bill is passed those on the lowest incomes, including people with disability, will be further pushed into poverty and financial hardship. It will make it harder for people with disability to start or to continue undertaking education. Plans to cut these payments are counter to the Governmentâ€™s focus on increasing employment opportunities through further education. Whilst expectations for pensioners to undertake education increase, the very means of supporting access to education for pensioners are being cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is seeking to make savings off the back of the lowest socio-economic groups, battlers and vulnerable members of our communities, who are struggling to pull themselves up by learning, studying and expanding their horizons through education. I am very pleased not to be supporting this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  Like others on this side of the House, I strongly oppose the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017. As the St Vincent de Paul Society observed in a well-reasoned submission to the inquiry of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee into the bill, these proposals cut existing payments to those who need them most and re-enforce existing disparities in access to education. The main losers here will be the young, the disabled and women. It might be a little bit unfair to suggest that these three groups are among the government's preferred targets, so let's just say that they are among the most familiar ones. It's a recurring theme, isn't it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes aren't just mean and parsimonious but very short-sighted. In one form or another, they have been a dark cloud hanging over the community in education sectors for the last two parliaments. We hear time and time again from the other side about how much they value education. But it appears they only value education to their constituents, not to everyone. These cuts will affect tens of thousands of Australians. Even ex-service men and women seeking to make a fresh start or to better themselves by furthering their education or acquiring new skills will be drawn into the net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As submissions to the recent Senate inquiry noted, the bill's key proposals have no convincing policy rationale, like many of the changes coming from the other side. While so-called streamlining is given as a justification for one small set of changes, the main elements of the bill will add further complexity to what all agree is already a complex set of legislative and administrative arrangements. The government had the opportunity by way of the recent Senate committee inquiry to expand on its reasons for persisting with the proposed cuts but declined to do so. Having abandoned its totally untenable plan to abolish the education entry payment and the pensioner education supplement, the government apparently now feels that it's entitled to the equivalent of a free pass on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says that the measures will save $96 million in total over five years. That sounds like a lot of money but it's a tiny fraction of the annual cost to the federal budget of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions given to some of Australia's wealthiest people. It really is a shame, and something that this government should hang its head about. The proposed saving would not even be enough to meet the cost of the same-sex marriage plebiscite, much less the billions the government plans to give foreign based and foreign owned multinationals by way of corporate tax cuts. The government will argue that you have to start somewhere and every little bit helps, but why start here with those most disadvantaged? Why pick on those already struggling? Why pick on those who are undeniably the most disadvantaged? Why do that? For instance, poverty rates among unemployed single parentsâ€”one of the principal targets hereâ€”are 10 times higher than for lone parents in paid work. It's hard enough to overcome these sorts of odds as it is, without government coming along and cutting one of the few benefits that might help you find a way back to employment. The proposed measures will potentially harm around 50,000 recipients annually. About 10,000 of them will be hit by more than one of the proposed cuts. In the case of the pensioner education supplement, 41 per cent receive the disability support pension and over 80 per cent are women. As you can see, they are targeting the most disadvantaged yet again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill poses a serious threat to those wanting to better themselves in their future job prospects. The proposed changes to the pensioner education supplement, in particular, will not only add to existing complexity but also open up new areas of uncertainty in determining what constitutes a study period for the purposes of accessing support. The proposed savings also come at a cost. In the longer term, both the community and the budget bottom line will end up paying the price of keeping people in poverty and not giving them the help they need to get an education and access to a decent job and a better life. Surely the minister must know that. Surely he can't have forgotten his own fine words in September last year when, addressing the National Press Club, he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The hope for a young Australian facing challenging family circumstances today will be that the system is going to provide for them with immediate support, but also surely they should expect that the same system will not just set them and forget them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Surely they expect that as well as welfare money given in the here and now, that support is going to be thoughtfully structured in a way designed to help them cope, not just in the present, but also in a way that maximises their future opportunities for self-reliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach taken here is to whip away the immediate support and hope that in the long run self-reliance will magically somehow win through. The contents of the bill have already been extensively debated and examined, including by three Senate committees. In one form or another, the two core elements of the bill have been around since the first Abbott-Hockey budget and have been before this House on five previous occasions. They foundered each time, with very good reason. The substance of the present bill was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in late June and the committee, which divided on party lines, reported on 7 September. The committee didn't conduct public hearings and took no evidence apart from eight submissions prepared by community organisations and one prepared by the minister's department. The latter was pretty perfunctory, running to just four pages. It added nothing to the minister's second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum. I guess that after four years, even the departmental officers must be a bit over it. Carers Australia, the Australian Council of Social Service, People with Disability Australia, Children and Young People with Disability Australia, the Australian Association of Social Workers, the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children and the National Social Security Rights Network each made submissions to the Community Affairs Committee inquiry. Each of those submissions opposed the bill. Not one single community organisation supports this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four elements to the bill. It will further limit eligibility for the relocation scholarship for youth allowance and Austudy recipients. It will make it harder to access the full education entry payment, currently only $208 per annum, that assists students in meeting some of the up-front costs of entering improved training and education programsâ€”an absolute pittance. It will cut fortnightly supplementary support for many students engaged in other than full-time study by linking student workload requirements to a less generous and more complex formula for calculating entitlements. It will stop the pensioner education supplement being paid to students during non-teaching periods such as semester breaks. I'd add one other thing: it completely complicates the whole access to support for people who already have poor resources and who are already struggling. It is really shameful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What ties these proposals together is they will cut needs based supplementary support to people undertaking bona fide education and training programs. The bulk of costs of participating in those programs, including the opportunity costs, are met by the participants themselves. The payments under attack aren't handouts. They are a leg-up, they're support and they're help. For the vast majority of those to be affected, government support covers only a fraction of their actual costs. As anyone who has been in training or who has children in educational support knows, the costs are much higher than these pitiful payments. They are not overly generous; they are very poor. For instance, the education entry payment, which is meant to partly cover the start-up costs of entering training or a course of study, has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in 1992. Back then, in the pre personal computer and pre laptop era, the educational entry payment was $200 per annum. Currently, it stands at a magnificent $208 per annum! That is a change of $8, if my maths is correct, in 25 years. It is pathetic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The supplementary payments that this bill will erode are not available to all students, only those facing particular barriers to entering formal training and higher education. You can't access those supplementary payments unless you are in a disadvantaged or dependent category and meet the stringent eligibility requirements for attracting a primary government pension or benefit, such as youth allowance, ABSTUDY, Austudy, Newstart, the carer payment or the disability support pensionâ€”et cetera. That's as well as being an Australian resident and undertaking approved qualifying studies. The requirements are already onerous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also missing the point in arguing, in respect of some of its proposed cuts, that those who have their payments reduced can take out a student loan. HECS HELP, FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loans simply don't cover many of the up-front and ongoing costs involved in participating in education, which are met in part by these supplementary payments. Nor are those generic, loan-based forms of support sufficient to meet the particular needs of all of those suffering disability or disadvantage. It also seems to have escaped this government's attention, too, that this is one of the most difficult times in many decades for those seeking to fight their way out of poverty, overcome disadvantage and enter the work force. The proposed measures also form part of a constellation of government cuts to education, cuts to universities, higher student fees and less accommodative payback periods for student loans under HECS and HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also seems blissfully unaware that income support and family payments have gone backwards in real and relative terms in recent times. Income support payments have fallen further behind average wages even though average wages are stagnant. If you're a single mum working one shift a week, you've had your family tax benefit rate frozen and there's a good chance you have seen your penalty rates cut too. Cost of living pressures are always most keenly felt by those on lower incomes. You expect that would be the case even if the principal costs faced by those enduring financial hardship weren't rising faster than consumer prices more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the most recent ABS figures confirm, it's pensioners and persons who rely most on government support who are under the most pressure from healthcare costs; gap fees; and housing, insurance, gas and electricity costs, which are rising much faster than the CPI average and are also rising much faster than their wages. Unemployment rates are stuck at near-record-low GFC levels. Underemployment rates are at record highs. This is not an easy time to be digging your way out of poverty or confronting hardship and debt, yet this government is not making it any easier. In his 2016 National Press Club speech, to which I referred earlier, the minister rightly bemoaned the complexity of Australia's social welfare arrangementsâ€”and he has just made them more complex. If anyone in the country has a right to complain about government red tape and overregulation, it's the poor and the disadvantaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Presently, only about 300 of the 23,000 students in receipt of the relocation scholarship fall into this category. A further 150 Australian resident students who are currently studying overseas were also able to access the relocation scholarship. The government asserts that such students can only access the scheme because of a loophole in the current law and that the relocation scholarship should only be available to those having to move to and from remote and regional areas within Australia for study purposes. Whatever the intention of the parliament in enacting the scheme in 2010 and then amending it in 2015, there is a solid argument for not disadvantaging the small number of Australian students with both parents based overseas who also meet all the other mandatory requirements necessary to qualify for a relocation scholarship. Such students are up against the same problem that remote and regional students living in Australia faceâ€”through no fault of their own they have to relocate a significant distance to further their studies. I note, too, that there are humanitarian concerns that young people who arrive in Australia as unaccompanied minors might also be disadvantaged by the proposed amendments as they currently stand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I'd like to say that, despite the claim of better targeting, none of the savings made will be distributed to enhance continuing entitlements but will simply be skimmed off into consolidated revenue. The government does not have the luxury of arguing that funding is being shifted from the deserving to the even more deserving. Nor is this bill about better targeting or streamlining. They are merely euphemisms. This is a government grab for cashâ€”nothing more, nothing lessâ€”and it's from the most disadvantaged people in our community. It really is shameful. We have seen a litany of these bills come through the parliament in the last few weeks. One has to wonder about the psychology of a government that continues to attack, time and time again, those in the community who are most disadvantaged yet is continuing to allow concessions to the wealthy, such as capital gains tax concessions and negative gearing, and also major tax cuts to big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that does not seem to want to give the poorest a leg-up. Perversely, it's an attack on the very sorts of people this government says deserve support and encouragement, but it does the oppositeâ€”the self-starters and the very people who are trying their hardest not to let adversity get the better of them. This is really quite a comedown from the lofty ideals outlined by the minister. It's lazy, unimaginative and bullying government at its very worst.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I rise today with my Labor Party colleaguesâ€”including the member for Macarthur, who articulated very well what Labor feels about the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017 and what Labor's position isâ€”to oppose this bill. Here we go again. The Prime Minister and the Liberal coalition government are making yet another attempt at cutting support to ordinary and low-income Australians. The changes proposed in this bill will predominantly affect people with a disability, carers, sole parents and unemployed people who are reskilling and retraining. I see this bill not just in the context of social policy but also in the context of economic policy. The bill shows that the Prime Minister and the government are absolutely out of touch and are completely oblivious to the true costs of living for most Australians. In fact, it is uncaring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply concerned by the proposals contained in schedules 2 and 3 of this billâ€”namely, the government's proposal to remove the eligibility for education entry payments for recipients who undertake less than 25 per cent of the full-time study load and the government's proposal to cut the amount payable under the education entry payment for those undertaking between 26 per cent and 75 per cent of the full-time study load. These payments function to give income support recipients the opportunity to reskill and to re-enter the work force, and isn't that what we want, so that this country has a consistently evolving and innovating workforce? The Prime Minister says that it's important to get income support recipients into the workforce. Yet there is a cut to the very payments and supports designed to do exactly that. I don't know whether it's incompetence, chaos or just a lack of caring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 is the education entry payment. The education entry payment is an annual payment of $208 to assist certain social security recipients with the cost of education so that they can eventually re-enter the workforce. Recipients of Newstart, parenting payment single, the disability support pension, special benefit payments and the carer payment and some closing payment recipients are eligible to receive the education entry payment if they are studying an approved course. But what this bill proposes in schedule 2 is to link the amount of support received under this payment to study loads or the amount received under the pensioner education supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill creates a definition for a normal amount of full-time study, and the payment received will be determined by the study load as a percentage of the full-time study. Students with a study load of between 51 per cent and 75 per cent will be $52 worse off per annum. Students with a study load of between 26 and 50 per cent will be $104 worse off per annum. In the 2016-17 financial year, 11,662 people received the education entry payment. Of those, 4,805 were recipients of the single parenting payment, 2,986 were recipients of the disability support pension, 2,762 were recipients of Newstart and 826 were recipients of the carer payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recipients of the payment are less likely than other students to be able to undertake studies full-time, as they often have health barriers or caring responsibilities, as just articulated, that prevent them from doing so. The overwhelming majority are recipients of single parenting payments or the carer payment and disability support pensioners. Disproportionately, the carer payment and the parenting payment are paid to women, and it follows that this schedule will disproportionately impact on women; 94 per cent of recipients of single parenting payments are women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also concerned about schedule 3, which includes cuts to the pensioner education supplement. The pensioner education supplement is a fortnightly payment to some social security recipients to assist with the ongoing cost of study. Currently the pensioner education supplement is paid at $62.40 per fortnight, or $1,622 per year, for full-time students or $31.20 per fortnight, $118 a year, for part-time students. That is a lot of money. It is paid in every fortnight, and the recipient receives the payment from Centrelink. This bill cuts the pensioner education supplement during non-study periods. This will result in a cut for every recipient of the supplement, as it will no longer be paid every fortnight of the year. How stingy and how mean is that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recipients of the pensioner education supplement, like recipients of the education entry payment, are less likely than other students to be able to maintain a full-time study load, because of health barriers and caring responsibility. Those with a study load of between 51 and 75 per cent and those with a study load of 25 per cent will be $15.60 worse off per fortnight. In the 2016-17 financial year, 37,717 people received the pensioner education supplement. Of those, about 16,000 were on the single parent payment, about 15,000 were recipients of the disability support pension, over 3,000 were recipients of the carer payment and well over 2,000 were recipients of Newstartâ€”the same groups I spoke about earlier. The Australian Council of Social Service estimated that 75 per cent of recipients of the pensioner education supplement were women. It follows, as I said regarding the previous schedule, that this will disproportionately impact on women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a theme emerging here. This is the latest attack on everyday, ordinary Australiansâ€”most significantly, Australians who are in receipt of those payments and who are desperately attempting to retrain and reskill themselves and get into the shrinking job market. And we have heard much about the fact that there are so many people who are underemployed. This is the very group of people the government says it wants to get into employment, yet these two schedules are doing everything to make it difficult for that group of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the government talk about getting income support recipients standing on their own feet and getting back into the workforce, as I just said, but how can one believe that? How can the public believe it? More importantly, how can this significant group of people believe the government's rhetoric when the reality is that the mechanics of government are making it much more difficult? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's favourite buzzwords of 'innovation' and 'agility' hold about as much political substance as something that evaporates. They look good; they sound good; but, ultimately, you just don't know what the Prime Minister actually stands forâ€”and, by association, what this government stands for. If we want income support recipients off income support and back into the workforce, we need to help them reskill and skill up to ensure they are best placed to re-enter the workforce. If we want a constantly evolving workforce that meets the constantly evolving needs of the economy, we need to provide income support recipients with the capacity to reskill and skill up. These Australians, who so happen to need a bit of help to support them while they undertake further study, are being disproportionately punished. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find astonishing the contempt with which this government views income support recipients. I have articulated this week and in the past, as my colleagues have, on countless occasions, theâ€”I can't even find the wordsâ€”veil of invisibility over that rhetoric. The pursuit of 20,000 Australians with the robo-debt recovery; forcing older Australians to wait for almost a year to qualify for the age pension; drug testing income support recipients despite the evidence against; 42 million unanswered calls to Centrelink; underfunding and under-resourcing Human Services, including axing 1,100 jobs; cutting back backdating payments, cutting back eligibility for the age pension: the list goes on in this victimisation. Those opposite are only interested in making it so difficult and so painful, and in feeding negative stereotypes about people who need our supportâ€”people who rely on governments of both persuasions to help them in the most difficult of times. This means that you on the other side are completely out of touch, and people understand that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the principles of this country, one of the things that Australians pride themselves on, is the notion of a fair go, and this bill and these measures are not about a fair go. A fair go includes the times when many Australians require support. To cut these payments is, as I said earlier, stingy and mean. The education entry payment and the pensioner education supplement are most commonly paid to recipients of the parenting payment. As I said, most of them are women. A single mum working one shift a week has just had her family tax benefit rate frozen and her penalty rates cut, and she could be facing a loss of the energy supplement as well. The government say that they have given up on their unfair cuts, but we knowâ€”and this is an exampleâ€”that those unfair cuts are well and truly alive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a war being waged by the Liberals on the social safety net, something that we as Australians have built, should be proud of and should be protecting. We believe those who are unable to help themselves should be supported. We believe those who make a reasonable attempt at contributing to the economy, contributing to the community, but are unsuccessful, for many reasons, should be given the necessary support until they are in a position to do so. That is socially responsible. It is economically responsible, which is of course an important point. Labor believes in strengthening our social safety net, not diminishing it or overseeing its demise. Labor believes it can be and should be accessible and accountable to all Australians when they need it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish my comments by saying that those of us on my side of the House are the people that are taking up the cudgels for those that need support. It astounds me that, in the desperate search for a negative narrative about people on income support, the government is undertaking these stingy, mean cost-saving measures to the cost of people who are seeking to improve their lives; to the cost of people who want to contribute to the economy; to the cost of people who are demonstrating, by re-entering the education and skilling system, that they are committed to what we are all committed to in this place, and that is getting people into employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not try to paint Labor as not wanting to get people back into employment. That is scandalous. That is what we want to do, and that is what these measures are doing, yet you see fit to slash those measures. You see fit to take away the very thing that is giving some people the hope of being able to re-skill and re-enter the workforce. Do you really think people want to be unemployed? Do you really think people want to have a disability? Do you really think people want to rely on a social safety net for their entire lives? No, they don't. Labor has been clear: if people are scamming the system, they should bear those consequences, but to put this bill into this place, attempting to undermine the very people you say you want to support, is nothing less than scandalous. It's duplicitous, and you should be ashamed of yourselves for doing so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I wasn't on the list but I am called to speak. I am moved to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017, not just to fill three minutes and avoid a division but because I wish to condemn the government in the strongest possible terms for this latest attack on the most vulnerable Australians. This bill slashes support yet again to low-income Australians. Abolishing the pensioner education supplement, paid to 11,000 people, and the education entry payment, paid to 38,000 peopleâ€”and I note there are about 9Â½ thousand people who get the double whammy and lose bothâ€”is a disgrace. These payments, quite simply, are to help social security recipients with the costs of study. $62 may not seem a lot to those opposite, who've just awarded themselvesâ€”and everyone in this House, to our shameâ€”a tax cut, along with everyone else earning over $180,000, but to people on the disability support pension, carers, sole parents and the unemployed, these payments are critically important to helping them into study or training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this, because I was raised by a single mum. When we were at school, I saw the difficulties that going back to do a year 12 subject caused my mum. That was one subject, while trying to raise two kids. I'm proud to say that she topped the state in VCE psychologyâ€”probably trying to understand her two kids! I saw the difficulties firsthand, and I know the difference that these kinds of payments can make in my community. They incentivise and help people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are zombie measures. We have seen them before. They've been hanging around since 2014. You can kill a zombie only by finding its brain and hacking it out. Obviously the government hasn't managed to find its own brain and hack it out, or we wouldn't be having this debate yet again, day after day, month after month. They're based on the flawed trickle-down theory embedded within this government's political and budgetary prioritiesâ€”that is, if you cut spending, take away from the most vulnerable in society, give tax cuts to the rich, give Gina Rinehart and her mates the biggest tax cuts in the country with $65.4 billion, somehow everyone will be better off. I'm going to say the 'p' word. I know those opposite get sensitive when you say the 'p' word: poverty, poor people. If you take that trickle-down economic theory to its logical conclusion then you should plough poor people into the fields for a more efficient use of their carbon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the big picture that this budget measure sits within. There is the tax cut to the top end, the $65.4 billion of multinational tax cuts, and further defence of regressive taxation loopholesâ€”negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. Yet this budget measure is also accompanied by a tax rise for everyone else in the country. There is bill after bill, taking away five bucks here, 10 bucks there, a hundred bucks there. They are having another go at the age pensioners: 'Let's take a little bit off migrant pensioners who spend eight weeks overseas visiting family before they die.' They are cutting funding for education and lowering repayment thresholds for any young person earning $42,000. Apparently that makes you rich enough to repay your uni debt and start a family while putting up with frozen family payments. The list goes on. When you compare and contrast who gets benefits, who gets money, where they spend the money and where they take, you see what the government really thinks of those at the bottom.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other word they get sensitive about is inequality, because they do not accept there's a problem. Any self-help manual says, 'You have to accept there's a problem before you're able to address it and do anything about it.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise today to express my anger at the ongoing human rights abuses occurring in Cambodia and the unwillingness of the current government to do or say anything about this fast-escalating political crisis. I do so on behalf of thousands of Cambodian Australians who I have the great privilege of representing in this chamber. In May I spoke about the anniversary of the murder of Dr Kem Ley, a leading light for the democracy movement and the Cambodian government's most ardent critic. He was shot dead in broad daylight in the streets of Phnom Penh. Since then, the situation has deteriorated further. The Cambodian opposition leader, Kem Sokha, has been arrested on treason charges. The Cambodian government is now attempting to dissolve the opposition party and this week passed a law to redistribute opposition seats back to the government. Extreme violence has been perpetrated to suppress free and fair elections, members of parliament have been beaten and protesters have been shot dead. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How bad does this situation have to get before the foreign minister says something about it? Australia has a special responsibility to the Cambodian people because of our unique role in the Paris peace accords signed 26 years ago next week. These flagrant and violent abuses of human rights are unacceptable to my Cambodian-Australian constituents and they are unacceptable to me. I ask that the Australian government take a stand on this issue. We need to use our power in the region to properly represent my constituents and their family and friends who remain back home in Cambodia.</span>

The report gives me great optimism that we can fix this broken GST system. It is clear from this report that we have a serious national economic problem on our hands. For many years, Western Australia has been stripped of billions of dollars in GST revenue. I have shared the frustration of 2Â½ million fellow Western Australians as our share of the GST pool has diminished. The Turnbull government is the only government that has acted, delivering top-up payments to compensate Western Australiaâ€”</span>

                  </a>  I will get to you, Member for Burt. Importantly, the Productivity Commission has identified the very flawed distribution measure. Horizontal fiscal equalisation has evolved with the best of intentions but has failed to achieve objectives. Because the Commonwealth Grants Commission aims to raise every state to the level of the highest performing state, Western Australia is haemorrhaging revenue. If we altered the horizontal fiscal equalisation to deliver a reasonable standard, WA would receive an additional $3.2 to $3.6 billion this year. It's clear the current system of horizontal fiscal equalisation is failing the national economy. The opposition, particularly those members from Western Australia, need to listen to the independent advice that this system is broken. </span>

The event served as a timely reminder of this important issue and provided knowledge, support and the opportunity for the school community to collaborate on solutions. We heard from inspirational speakers like Professor Ross Young, school based policeman Senior Sergeant Paul Ennis and the Glenala State High School captains, Jonathon Bryan and Sheba Ooms. The school also unveiled two new artistic murals created by the students to highlight the issue. These beautiful murals, made from 262 individual tiles painted by the students, represented the shared advocacy and solution of the local community on the day. </span>

It's only by speaking up and speaking out that we will put an end to domestic and family violence. I commend and congratulate the wonderful Glenala State High School principal, Anne Lawson, and all the teachers and our local community for the domestic violence symposium. To domestic violence, Inala says no.</span>

The electorate of Chisholm, which I now proudly serve as a member of this House, was named after Caroline Chisholm. The electorate was created in 1949, the same year my father migrated to Australia. I've always thought it particularly fitting that Chisholm was named after Caroline Chisholm, as she was a strong advocate for migration and she helped women, and Chisholm is one of the most culturally diverse electorates in Australia. Over 100 languages other than English are spoken there every day.</span>

I'm delighted that the author of this book, Sarah Goldman, is in the House today, because this is indeed an irresistible read. It encompasses a granular analysis of this amazing woman who helped shape our nation. Caroline Chisholm was indeed a feminist, described as a 'protofeminist', and had an instilled belief in diversity, inclusiveness and multiculturalism before her time. To quote from this book: 'Caroline Chisholm knew that a truly hardworking, eclectic community would eventually produce a proud, successful society full of heart and soul.'</span>

The people of Chisholm have together created an electorate that is a microcosm of Australia, the most successful multicultural nation on earth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise today to recognise that tomorrow, 20 October 2017, is World Osteoporosis Day. Osteoporosis is a disease that makes bones become brittle, leading to higher risk of breaks than in normal bones and resulting in fractures and, more importantly, decreased mobility and loss of quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated, with as many as 80 per cent of patients failing to receive appropriate treatment. As many as 4.7 million, or 66 per cent of, Australians over the age of 50 have poor bone health, costing the health system billions of dollars every year. Importantly, osteoporosis can be treated; however, early detection is vital to ensure that bone health is managed to prevent fractures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">World Osteoporosis Day is an opportunity to focus on bone health in Australia and to call on the community, doctors and policymakers to focus on this important health issue, which is resulting in over 160,000 fractures every year in Australia. By increasing awareness of osteoporosis in Australia and the preventive measures that can be taken to reduce fractures, we will improve the quality of life for millions of Australians in the future. I would encourage all members to support this important cause by helping to raise awareness of this silent disease affecting so many of our fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to joining members after question time today to meet with World Osteoporosis Day ambassadors Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Cathy Freeman and the CEO of Osteoporosis Australia, Dr Greg Lyubomirsky, who are in the gallery today to help promote World Osteoporosis Day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Recently I had the great privilege of attending the Emerald State Emergency Service awards day. The Emerald SES is an integral part of our community, and without the endless generosity of these men and women we would be without this vital emergency service. Their extensive volunteer work for the community during disastersâ€”natural and otherwiseâ€”is what keeps our community going strong. For this I was so proud to show my gratitude on behalf of the Australian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make a special mention of those who received awards on the day. Firstly, Captain Ben Owens, the recipient of the members' choice award. He is doing a fantastic job. Chris Franzman won the Haydn Davies Award; Peter Copp was presented with the John Reed Award and the Community Fundraiser Award; Daryl Bristowe was given the Controllers Award; Derek Harris was given the Night Owl Award; Phil Pascall was awarded with the Training Member of the Year Award and the Community Education Award; and Phil Butterley was also awarded with a Training Member of the Year Award. Incredibly, the Emerald SES attended 1,500 jobs last year, which is pretty much four jobs a day. They are not a big SES, with 70 members, but they are lifting their weight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, it looks like we will have some good news: we are going to have a new Emerald SES building. I congratulate the emergency service workers in Emerald for the fantastic work they do. They deserve their new building.</span>

We call on the federal government to immediately introduce legislation which will see the inclusion of 10 days paid domestic violence leave in the national employment standards. What I said is 'support'â€”not a bunch of those opposite wearing ribbons and painting their nails, showing support but not using their position of power in this place to do something about it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family and domestic violence, as we are all very, very well aware, is the leading cause of death, disability and illness among women in the 15 to 44 age group. It is greater than cancer or heart disease. Yet access to paid domestic violence leave is limited. Paid family violence leave means a woman can access support services so she can leave. It means she can attend court or doctors' appointments, or meet with real estate agents and find secure housing for herself and her children, without the fear of losing her job. Paid domestic violence leave will save lives. The estimated cost of introducing this is just 5c per day per workerâ€”5c! The estimated cost of the family and domestic violence that is currently hitting our communities and streets is $12.6 billion per year. </span>

I join with the member for Bass in reflecting on the fact that this is an important opportunity for this parliament to reflect on bone health in Australia. This is a serious health issue which is resulting in over 160,000 fractures each year. In fact, in 2016 it cost our economy more than $2 billion. Osteoporosis makes bones become brittle, leading to a higher risk of breaks than in normal bones, resulting in fractures, increased immobility and loss of quality of life. Unfortunately osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs. This is why osteoporosis is often called the silent disease. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the world's poorest rates for identifying and treating osteoporosis. Around 70 to 80 per cent of those who have a broken bone are not properly diagnosed and, therefore, not receiving appropriate medical care. By 2022 there will be 6.2 million Australians aged 50 years or older with osteoporosis. Such alarming statistics should compel all of us to better understand the growing health crisis at our door. It's important because it can be treated if detected early. Today in the gallery we have three inspiring Australians: Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Cathy Freeman, who are both World Osteoporosis Day ambassadors, and the CEO of Osteoporosis Australia, Dr Greg Lyubomirsky, who is also an inspiring Australian. I thank them for all the work they are doing for this important cause. I urge all Australians to use the Know Your Bones online self-assessment tool and have a greater understanding of their individual health. </span>

This unfolding scandal shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, already accused by Amnesty International and other NGOs of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruptions and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014 through a network of opaque British companies. Investigations led by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project have revealed that these illicit payments, using reputable banks and secret companies, aimed to buy political influence and launder Azerbaijan's international image. Just this week, the ASIO annual report warned that foreign governments have been attempting to shape the opinions of the public and the media in covert influence operations. </span>

Upon her return she stated on the public record, 'Australia is a forthright supporter of Azerbaijan's sovereignty and territorial integrity and strongly supports Azerbaijan's position on Nagorno-Karabakh.' This bold statement rewrites Australian foreign policy and disregards Australia's longstanding support of the OSCE Minsk Group peace efforts for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict based on the principles of equal rights and the self-determination of people.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the ceasefire between the two countries in 1994, the OSCE has been responsible for promoting negotiations, ceasefire monitoring and conflict resolution. Three immediate priorities for the de-escalation of tensions have been proposed. The first is the removal of snipers along the line of contact, the second is the increase in the number of OSCE monitors in the region and the third is the establishing of gunfire locator systems as an investigative measurement to determine which side is responsible for future ceasefire violations. These suggestions apply to both sides of the conflict. Armenia is ready to accept the OSCE recommendations; Azerbaijan is not. OSCE suggested that confidence- and security-building measures are a prerequisite for not only the advancement of negotiations but also the stabilisation of the region through deterring future aggression.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  On Saturday, two large truck bombs were detonated in a public area in Mogadishu. Over 300 people were killed and many hundreds more have been wounded. The bombing is one of the worst terrorist attacks anywhere in the world since September 11. It's been attributed by the Somali government and others to the al-Qaeda affiliated Al Shabaab, and I utterly condemn those who have perpetrated this act of extreme violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I wish to extend my deepest condolences to all of those who have been affected or who have lost loved ones in this atrocity both in Somalia and here in Australia. My electorate of Melbourne is home to many Somali-Australians, and the local community has been deeply shaken by this devastating attack. Members of Melbourne's Somali community have raised funds and called for peace in the wake of this bombing. They have informed me of Mogadishu's overwhelmed hospitals and the urgent need for medical aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our media and political system must not fail the Somali community in the wake of this bombing. When terrorists kill white people, it's on the front page of every Australian newspaper and dominates the nightly news, but when it happens in Africa, it's buried up the back of the world news section. It pains me that we didn't even have a statement from the Prime Minister or a minute's silence in here as we have had when there have been other terrorist attacks. We need to send a strong statement from this parliament that black lives matter as well and that, when people in Africa are killed by terrorism, we should treat it just as importantly as when white people are killed. Sadly, when people flee Somalia and seek safety here, we too often lock them up and turn them away. We must not fail our Somali community.</span>

It's an opportunity for all of us to encourage particularly physical health but mental health as well amongst members of the veteran community throughout Australia, their families and all of those who support them. A number of programs conducted and sponsored by the Department of Veterans' Affairs will go to the theme of next week's activities. They include the Heart Health Program, which aims to increase physical fitness; veterans will be able to be referred by their general practitioner to an exercise physiologist; and the Rehabilitation Appliances Program. These are good programs that will ensure that those who serve this country in various aspects of our military forces are provided with the best services that can be given to them in return for that wonderful service. I will be delighted to participate in the week's activities. On Saturday morning, I will take part in a Soldier On ride from their headquarters in Parkville and then, on the following Sunday, I will ride with a group of legatees.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak about the provision of health services and, in particular, GPs in our electorates. The Rural Other Medical Practitioners Program, ROMPs, provides a full Medicare rebate to eligible practitioners in specific locations, despite the fact that they may have completed their training overseas. Most of Darwin and Palmerston falls under ROMPs, but several medical practitioners and clinic owners have approached my office and raised concerns because newer suburbs in Darwin and Palmerston are not listed as being included in the program.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory, including my electorate, has some of the lowest numbers of GPs per capita. As an example, the suburb of Rosebery has half a GP per 1,000 people, whereas Sydney has about nine GPs per 1,000 people. I've written to the Minister for Health and the assistant minister about this; however, their response is that they don't seem to care too much about this. According to them, they are satisfied with the current GP levels in Palmerston, which are 18 times less than those in Sydney. I call on the government to immediately review the suburbs of Darwin and Palmerston that aren't currently listed on the ROMPs program and work to make sure that all suburbs are covered.</span>

The petition also raises very serious concerns about issues of religious freedom in Vietnam. As a longstanding advocate for religious liberty in all countries around the world, the situation in Vietnamâ€”where there is stigmatisation and marginalisation of some religious communities, particularly those who are Catholic and who sometimes end up being asylum seekers in Australiaâ€”remains an enduring issue of concern for me. It is an issue that I have dealt with in the past, in my visits to Hanoi, in my former capacity as a Human Rights Commissioner. I have also dealt with the enduring challenges around freedom of speech, particularly for marginalised bloggers who wish to stand up and speak out about political issues in Vietnam. The petition seeks to address these issues by raising them with our government. I bring it to the government's attention and hope that they will take appropriate action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain Australian citizens and Vietnamese Australians Draws to the attention of the House: In April 2016, millions of tons of fish were found dead on the Vietnamese central coastline due to toxic waste discharged by Formosa Steel International, leading to one of the biggest environmental disaster in the region in recent times. After several months of denial, Formosa conceded responsibility. This catastrophe decimated the Vietnamese fishing industry, leading to countless job losses, profound health and environmental implication on humans, fauna, flora and surrounding ecosystems. How far, how wide and how long its impact is yet to be determined. The lack of response from the government lead to protests, and calls for action to assist victims, remedial action and accountability across the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  This morning I joined my Labor colleagues in meeting frontline workers who are assisting and supporting victims of family and domestic violence as part of the We Won't Wait campaign. What they won't wait for is domestic violence leave. Despite having to still wait to meet with government members who cancelled their meeting, the time for waiting for change should end. Domestic violence leave costs about 5c a day per employee, but the real point is: 39 women have died due to domestic violence in 2017 already. A lack of domestic violence leave means further trauma for domestic violence victims rather than the assistance a compassionate society should provide. What I ask everyone to consider is: if you think the burden of including paid DV leave in the National Employment Standards is too onerous, why are you not doing more to prevent domestic violence in the first place? Don't argue against the leave. Argue and campaign againstâ€”preventâ€”domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Australian, Queensland and Victorian state governments have now introduced 10 days of paid DV leave for public servants. Yet, through the Minister for Employment, who is also the Minister for Women, this government stands opposed not only to paid DV leave being included in the NES but also to Australian public servants receiving it. The Prime Minister likes to talk a big game about his support for women, yet, as evidenced in the proportion of women in his party room and ministry, this Prime Minister is all talk and no action, and Australian women are much worse off because of it.</span>

Unfortunately, this is the story of Africa. At the moment, the conflict and corruption in Africa has translated into a famine. I bring to the parliament's attention the 17 million people, particularly children, who are now dealing with starvation. This was shown to me by Doctors Without Borders when they work out a child's level of malnutrition. When it gets to the red level, they are at a critical stage where they could die, frankly.</span>

We pay our taxes and we sometimes wonder what we get for them, but can I say that with responsible spending of the collective wealth of Australia we become responsible citizens in the world. We will stand by people when they are in difficult times. We will stand by people who are starving. We will stand by people when they need food and medicine. Many things are often debated around foreign aid, but we should be proud as Australians, because we are a wealthy country and we are a generous country. I am pleased that the minister has listened to my discussions with her on this issue and has delivered. We are standing by people around the world who are in desperate need and in a very difficult situation.</span>

The Prime Minister has thoughtfully offered struggling families some help with out-of-control power bills. He is giving families 50c a week! He is so generous, he is so loving, he is so kind! He understands his subjects. He is one of us. He is so in touch. I'm told our nation will soon be doing more to honour our dear leader's generosity. Planning is already underway for the festival of the half dollar. The Australian Mint will be issuing a commemorative 50c coin. Thousands of Australians will be making one local call in celebration! We thank the Prime Minister for his compassion and his big heart. People who can't pay their power bills can now pay for a soft serve from Macca's, or save for a month and buy a can of Coke. This is a truly remarkable offer from our most charitable and excellent leader. We do not deserve his kindness, but we are grateful for it nonetheless. There really has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian. Thank you, Prime Minister, thank you. Dear leader, resolute Malcolm the magnificentâ€”50c! </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than that, we have the number of farmers in our electorate that provide the food and soilâ€”healthy soil, healthy people. What has happened is that one farmer in his shed, Neil Olsen, has produced a piece of equipment that, when run through the ground, increases the carbon in the soil and improves the soil. You say: 'But that's just a plough. That's nothing special! That's just a plough.' Well, it works. It gives a one per cent per month increase in the carbon in the soil. Better soil, better food, better nutrition: that's what we've got to deliver to our children. I wonder whether, as a nation, we should be looking at what we're putting through these lips and whether it's good for us. If it's not good for us we should be doing something about it. Let's start with healthy soil. </span>

Labor has always backed the Australian car industry and Australian auto workers. We respect the pride and the purpose the auto industry has brought to so many lives. We see it as an irreplaceable part of our national identity. Through seven decades, Holden endured recession, adapted to changing tastes and boosted the skills of its workforceâ€”seven decades, but they couldn't last five years of the Abbott-Turnbull government, with its lazy, arrogant, conservative ideology, which dared and goaded this national icon to pack up and go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister sat around that cabinet table, and the Liberal Party will wear the responsibility of the closure of Holden and the car industry forever. No-one will forget what this Prime Minister had to say when Holden announced it was closing its doors. Was it sympathy for the workers? Was it thanks for their contribution? No. He said: you needed greater productivity. This is a sad day for thousands of workers and their families. It didn't need to be. My message to manufacturing workers right across Australia is simple. Labor values what you do and, when and if we are elected, we will have your back. We still believe success can be made in Australia.</span>

Energy will always be unreliable under a Labor government because the Labor Party does not understand the engineering or the economics required to deliver sensible, rational energy policy. We don't have to speculate or theorise about it. Labor has proved its incompetence in the energy sector again and again, more so in South Australia than anywhere else, where we've seen the most expensive and the least reliable electricity in Australiaâ€”a tribute to the triumph in the Labor Party's pantheon of ideology and idiocy. They aren't even competent in their ideology. If they wanted to have a state full of windmills, they could at least have provided the backup and the storage. But no, they didn't do that. They just assumed, I suppose, that the wind would always blow, and that they could literally blow up a coal-fired power station and rely, more in hope than expectation, on a long extension cord to the Latrobe Valley in Victoria.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party have failed Australia on energy and they have failed on economics. My government is delivering on economic leadership: 371,500 jobs created over the last 12 months, 85 per cent of them full-time. There hasn't been a longer run of jobs growth in 23 years. Jobs growth is the highest it's been since 2008 and is now faster than in any G7 economy. The participation rate is at five-year highs. Over the last two years, there have been 521,700 more Australians in jobs, and, since we were first elected four years ago, 825,500 jobs have been created. 'Jobs and growth' is not just a slogan; it is an outcome. It is an outcome delivering on jobs and growth. For all of the rhetoric and politics from the Leader of the Opposition, he can't defy the facts for much longer. Australians know that we are getting on with the job, we are leading and we are seeing jobs growth unparalleled for 23 years. That is the commitment of our economic leadership.</span>

There are 371,500 more Australians in work than a year ago. As I said a moment ago, it's been the longest run of monthly jobs growth since 1994. That is an extraordinary achievement and it is a tribute to the enterprise and the hard work of Australian businesses that are benefiting from the economic leadership my government is offering and the incentives to invest and employ that they are receiving from the enterprise tax cuts the parliament has approved, applying to small and medium businesses. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to energy, the Leader of the Opposition writes charming letters to me occasionally, talking about bipartisanship. But he went completely off the reservation this morning. He described the considered advice from the Energy Security Board, appointed by COAG, comprising five of the most knowledgeable people in the energy sector, as science fiction. That is what he said. Then, as he started to foam and froth at the mouth, he described it as propaganda from the government. This is a recommendation from an independent board, appointed by COAG, accountable to COAG, with more Labor governments appointing members to it than Liberal governments. These are people of immense expertiseâ€”the Energy Market Operator; the Energy Regulator; the chairman of the rules maker, the AEMC; and of course Dr Kerry Schott and Clare Savage, the independent chair and deputy chair. These are excellent appointments. They were praised by the member for Port Adelaide at the time, and he was right then. Now those opposite don't like the outcome and so all they can do is smear and play politics. Australians deserve better.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is this: Labor have failed to put Australian families first. They have failed to prioritise affordability and reliability. They have allowed Australians to see energy prices rise and gas become in short supply, all because of ideology and stupidity. Now we see the Leader of the Opposition complaining about jobs lost in renewables, or so he forecasts. What about the 5,000 jobs in Snowy Hydro 2.0? What about that? That is what we are creating.</span>

Power prices have never been higher than they are right now under the Liberals and, under this Prime Minister, pensioners are facing the axing of their energy supplement, a cut of $365 every year.

There are few things that really excite this side of the House more than Australians getting jobs. When Australians get jobs in this country, this side of the House cheers, roars and celebrates. They welcome Australians getting jobs, because the Turnbull government equals more jobs. That is what we know. Australia has just experienced the strongest annual full-time growth in jobs on record in 40 years. In the 40 years of records on full-time jobs growth, this has been the best record of full-time jobs growth: some 316,000 full-time positions were created in the last year and 371,000 jobs were created in total in the last 12 months. That means that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5 per cent, below where it was at the first time this government was elected back in 2013 and down more than half a full percentage point over the last couple of years. Nearly 20,000 new jobs were created in September. This is the 12th consecutive month that jobs growth has been present in our economy, which is the longest run of jobs growth in 23 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am listening for the congratulations from those opposite to those who got jobs and I can't hear a thing. I can't hear a thing from those opposite congratulating the businesses that have gone out and created those jobs. All I see is down faces, because the last thing they want to see is more jobs. That's because they are generated by their own self-interest when it comes to economic policy in this place. Jobs growth means the government's policies are working and that is something that this government can mark down as the consequence of good economic decisions and sound economic management. That includes the decisions we have taken on energy, whether it is securing gas for domestic use, getting the right deals out of retail energy companies, ensuring we get rid of the free kick for poles and wires companies that were driving up prices, or building Snowy 2.0. All of this was part of the Prime Minister's energy plan that was announced in the budget this year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To top that off there is the National Energy Guarantee, which provides certainty for investment, to drive an increase in investment in energy supply, which puts downward pressure on power prices, which means one thing: businesses' costs can be more affordable, which means they can employ more people, which means more jobs. The National Energy Guarantee is not just a guarantee to drive down power prices. The National Energy Guarantee is a guarantee for more jobs.</span>

They seem to have pulled out a question from the last sitting, from when we were last here over a month ago. What we have secured in terms of gas is an agreement with the big gas exporters to make sure that demand on the east coast is fulfilled, which means that there won't be a shortage of gas on the east coast, and if there isn't a shortage of gas on the east coast then there is no need to apply any restrictions on exports. It is an excellent outcome and one that has been welcomed by industry, by AiG and by BCA. It has been welcomed by industry, because they know that having gas at affordable prices in full supplyâ€”and, of course, price is a function of supply and demand, as all honourable members, on this side at least, are awareâ€”means that businesses and energy generators and households ultimately will be paying a fairer price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a very significant decline in wholesale prices for gas and we are seeing now industrial firms who are big consumers of gas getting longer-term contracts at much lower prices than had previously been offered, when there was a shortage. So, the government's policy worked, our action was successful and the gas is being delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Touching on economics and energy economics, I have to draw attention to a very interesting interview with the member for Sydney earlier today. She said, 'If you have an emissions intensity scheme'â€”which she said was their preferred modelâ€”'it has no cost to taxpayers, because high polluters are subsidising less-polluting forms of technology.' So, presumably, nobody pays for that. It is wonderful. The Leader of the Opposition talks about science fiction. I think he was talking about the economics of the member for Sydney. The reality is that everything has to be paid for. The bottom line is that you have to take the best advice to secure the best policy, grounded in expertiseâ€”as ours is, with the backing of the Energy Security Boardâ€”that will deliver, as we have heard from those experts, lower wholesale prices, better outcomes for families and affordable, reliable power as well as meet our emissions reduction obligations. That is hard-headed, clear-eyed economics and engineering. That is the ticket to secure our energy future.</span>

Today, Anglicare Australia released their jobs availability snapshot, which revealed nearly five applicants for every entry level job. Harvest season is approaching and farmers are looking for seasonal workers, with many positions just an hour away from metro areas. We must help unemployed Australians and our farmers needing workers to connect. I ask the minister: what specific promotional measures has the government implemented to ensure Australians on Newstart and youth allowance know about the Seasonal Workers Incentives Trial, which allows them to earn up to $5,000 before losing Centrelink payments?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr PYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:20</span>):  I thank the member for Mayo for her question about the Seasonal Work Incentives Trial. The very first thing I would say about her question is that the best news for anyone on youth allowance or Newstart is to get a full-time job or a part-time job. In the last 12 months, this government has created 371,500 new jobs. It is a record number, a record length of time of growth in the work force. The government's economic policies, which have been supported by many Australians, have seen 371,500 new jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those people who have not yet got work, who are on youth allowance or the Newstart program for three months or more, the government has introduced the Seasonal Work Incentives Trial, which the honourable member refers to, and that allows them to work in harvests, like for fruit and nuts and other crops, and earn up to $5,000 before they lose any of their Newstart or youth allowance. It's a really good program promoted by many members on this side of the House from regional areas and it helps to fill in some of the workforce gaps in areas of the regions that are looking for workers, particularly at harvest time, including in the member for Mayo's electorate. We have promoted it through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Harvest Guide</span>, we've promoted it with stakeholders like disability employment services, jobactive and the transition-to-work programs. There have been community forums and industry days held in capital cities and in regional areas across Australia, which the member for Mayo would be well aware of. We will continue to promote it in the media and to provide communications materials to stakeholders, because we want more people who are on Newstart or youth allowance to access that particular program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the greatest of respect to the member for Mayo, who I know comes from the great state of South Australia, the best thing that we in South Australia can do for young people looking for a job is provide them with a good, stable government in South Australia that understands the importance of reliable power and affordable power. And the most important thing the member for Mayo could do is to get her boss to stop promoting unstable government in South Australia by running for the state parliament and cutting and running from the Senate for the third time. Having left the Legislative Council early, he now wants to leave the Senate earlyâ€”and goodness knows how long he'll stay if he wins a seat in state parliament. The best thing the member for Mayo can do is support a Marshall Liberal government at next year's state election.</span>

I know that he supports the government's efforts to reduce power prices and create a more reliable system. The National Energy Guarantee is a credible, workable, pro-market policy which will help lower prices and create a more reliable system. It involves no subsidies, no taxes and no trading schemes. Given that 371,500 jobs were created in the last 12 months, lower energy prices will continue to help this strong jobs growth continue. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:28</span>):  In the national electricity market, twice as much energy is traded as is dispatched. There is an enormous trading system within the energy market, both trading over the counter and through the Australian Stock Exchange. That won't change. That is the virtue of the model that has been presentedâ€”the mechanism that has been presentedâ€”by the Energy Security Board. Rather than having a subsidies scheme like the Renewable Energy Target or a clean energy target that operates outside the market, you have market rules both in terms of guaranteeing reliability and guaranteeing a level of emissions consistent with Paris. Within those constraints, trading can occur freely. That is why retailers, who are those burdened by those constraints, are able to achieve the mix of generation sources that suits them. They will all be able to find the lowest cost and most competitive way to deliver on those two obligations. That is the mechanism. That is why it's been recommended by the Energy Security Board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side who are keen students of energy policy will know that John Pierce, the chairman of the Energy Market Commission, has been proposing an approach like this for yearsâ€”for at least seven years, he said today. He has always been a critic of the renewable energy target, or evolutions of it, because it does not operate within the confines of the market and therefore does not allow participants to achieve what we all seek to achieveâ€”well, I hope the honourable members on the other side will finally see reason and recognise that what we have here is a real opportunity to make a break with the mistakes of the past, a real game changer, recommended by the experts. It's not a proposal that the minister and I cooked up; this is a recommendation from the experts. It is built on the foundations of the Finkel review. It has been praised and endorsed by the Chief Scientist. It comes from a body established on the recommendation of the Chief Scientist.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the mechanism that can end the climate wars and deliver affordable, reliable energy for Australians and meet our emissions reduction obligations. Surely at some point Labor has to stop the politicking and get on board for affordability, reliability and responsibility in Australia's energy system.</span>

I know that the member is very aware of the fact that today we have 371,500 more Australians in jobs than a year agoâ€”that's the difference a coalition government makes; we actually get people into workâ€”and a 5.5 per cent unemployment rate, which is also a great example of good governance and good management.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the member for Dawson would also be aware of the problems in North Queenslandâ€”very aware of the problems in North Queenslandâ€”where the cost of electricity per tonne for sugar has gone from $35 in 2012 to $135 in 2016; and, for cane, from $4 in 2012 to $15 a tonne in 2016. This has brought out people such as Paul Schembri, a canegrower from Mackay. I know we both know him very well. He said the cost of electricity for Queensland cane farmers has increased by 130 per cent in the last eight years; at this rate, it will render large parts of our industry uneconomic. Energy costs have become the No. 1 cost threat to our industry. Queensland, now under a Labor government, has the highest power prices in Australia, which is a remarkable effort because they had to go around the other Labor state of South Australia. Right now, we have the Queensland energy minister, Mark Bailey, who said on 18 October:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got the member for Herbert. We actually can get jobs up thereâ€”they have 21.4 per cent unemployment in Townsvilleâ€”but the member for Herbert says, in regard to the Adani Carmichael mine, she has no personal opinion because she is 'totally irrelevant'. Isn't that great that the people of Townsville have sent down someone who, by their own admission, says they are totally irrelevant? I can tell you the member for Dawson is not totally irrelevant. He's very relevant. He is not driven by the Labor Party policies of activated almond and turmeric lattes or the Labor Party policies of wind-chime power and dreamcatcher nets!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where their power policy comes from. We believe in coal-fired power. We believe in gas-fired power. We believe in hydro. We believe in people having a job. We believe in the people of Ayr. We believe in the people of Home Hill. We are going to make sure that these people have a job. We do not think that blue-collar workers are, basically, politically irrelevant. What we see in the Labor Party all the time is that policy is driven by the green movement. They have given up on working-class people. They have given up on manufacturing jobs. They have no vision for Australia. They have no vision for Queensland. They do not have the confidence anymore of the once-great Labor Party that they had been.</span>

It's trading of electricity. It's not trading of permits. There are no certificates. There are no permits. It is trading of physical energy, which, as the honourable member should be very well aware, happens all the timeâ€”millions of dollars being traded every hour of the day. That has always been the case. But, as John Pierce, chair of the Australian Energy Market Commission, which is the rules-maker, and a member of the Energy Security Board, said today:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There are no subsidies or certificates involved in this guarantee and in this sense it does not involve a price or tax on carbon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member may yearn for the subsidy. This is the part of the Labor Party's position that I find most baffling. The Leader of the Opposition goes to a solar farm at Mildura and he stands there and he says, 'This is fantastic'. He's blinded by the light. He says, 'This is cheaper than new coal; it is so good.' Then he says, 'But that's why we have to subsidise it.' Talk about science fiction! What Australians deserve is affordable, reliable energy. What Labor has delivered is unaffordable and unreliable energy. Their policies make no sense. They try to defy the laws of physics. The Energy Market Operator, Audrey Zibelman, was asked about the reliability requirement, where she's having to intervene in the honourable member's state constantly to maintain stability, and she said, 'Well, you have to comply with the laws of physics.' That's true, but not if you're in the Labor Party, apparently. They think windmills will turn when there's no wind. They think solar panels will generate in the middle of the night. Perhaps that is from moonshineâ€”that is, moonbeams. But, worst of all, what this recklessness does is impose higher costs and less reliable power. Australians know Labor does not have the management or the business sense to deliver affordable and reliable power. Energy will always be unreliable and more expensive under Labor.</span>

The Turnbull government's responsible plan to deliver affordable and reliable energy is based on a belief that Australian household budgets must be relieved of the pressure on them, and so must businesses, and that we must drive jobs growth, as we've seen with the figures released today. The plan we have announced through the National Energy Guarantee will also enable us to meet our international obligations, and our Paris Agreement target will see emissions reductions of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is reasonable and achievable. It means that emissions per person will halve, and already emissions per capita in Australia are the lowest they've been in 27 years, because we have metâ€”indeed exceededâ€”the first Kyoto target by 128 million tonnes. We are on track to meetâ€”indeed exceedâ€”the second Kyoto target by 2020. Our Paris Agreement targets are reasonable, and they compare well with those of other developed countries. For example, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the EU all have a target range of between 25 and 35 per cent by 2030.</span>

                  </a>  In contrast to the Turnbull government's reasonable plan, Labor have embraced the reckless policies of the Greens: a 45 per cent emissions reduction target, way beyond that of any comparable economyâ€”a 50 per cent renewable energy target that will drive power prices through the roof and will see an increase in blackouts, as we've seen in South Australia. The Labor-Greens policy wants to close down coal-fired power stations. Our plan does not involve subsidies. Labor and the Greens want to spend $66 billion on subsidising renewable energy. That will drive costs through the roof, because the subsidy will be passed on to consumers, and they will bear the cost of Labor's reckless policies. The Labor-Greens policy on energy will hit the economy hard, will undermine jobs growth and will drive up unemployment. The choice is clear. Labor stands for higher power costs; the coalition stands for affordable and reliable electricity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to interesting utterances on energy, my attention was drawn to this extraordinary rant from the Leader of the Opposition this morning. It was just a jumble of inconsistencies. He said, 'We're not interested in trashing the renewable energy industry in this country.' This is the renewable energy industry that he says is already cheaper than coal and gas. So, presumably the fact that they're already cheaper means that taxpayers and consumers have to subsidise them to make them even cheaper. That's very interesting. Then he said, 'What we're interested in is lower prices.' Lower prices for whom? Not for Australian families. He wants to put a $66 billion tax on Australian families to 2050. He wants us to cut our emissions by twice as much as we undertook in Paris to do. Why would any nation do that? Why would you unilaterally cut your emissions by more than you'd agreed to in concert with others? He was asked again and again. He's had this proposal for years. Has he done any modelling on it? None at all. He has no idea what it will cost. Has anybody credible proposed it? No, they haven't.</span>

                  </a>  The science fiction of which the Leader of the Opposition spoke is surely his own approach to energy: solar panels that work at night, windmills that blow when the wind drops and the ability to force feed unbacked up renewable energy into the grid without creating unreliability. We know how that movie ends. It's South Australia; it's blackouts. It's unreliable and the most expensive electricity in Australia. Australians deserve better. That's why we're relying on the Energy Security Board and the prospect they have delivered of a clear energy policy with lower prices, affordability, reliability and responsibility.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:45</span>):  I thank the member for Fisher for his question. If we want to build on the 371,500 jobs that have been created by this government in the last 12 months, we need to have affordable and reliable power in this country. That is what the government is doing. That is what the government will be providing. We are not just doing it through the announcements we have made this week and through the National Energy Guarantee. For some time the government has been implementing policies that are driving down prices, whether it is the gas guarantee, where we have required the gas companies to put domestic supplies before their exports; whether it's the abolition of the limited merits review to ensure that we are attacking the network costs; or whether it's requiring gas companies to engage in a positive way with their customers to tell them about other deals they might have. We have been putting in place the policies that will drive down prices beyond the $115 that was identified by the Energy Security Board in the announcements this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The choice between this and the alternative is very clear. On the government side, you have an opportunity for affordable and reliable power, which is helping to drive jobs and helping to drive down the cost of living to take the pressure off hardworking families and businesses in terms of the price of their power. On the other side of the House, you have a blind ideological attachment to wind and solar power at all costsâ€”but, in fact, we know what the cost is. It's $66 billion worth of subsidies for wind and solar power. It's a $66 billion tax slug on hardworking Australian families and businesses to subsidise wind and solar, which the Labor Party already admits is competitive with coal and gas. It is truly a crazy policy. Even after that subsidy, Labor can't guarantee the reliability of the system or the affordability of the power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party is all over the shop on energy. At the beginning of this week, they attacked the National Energy Guarantee even before it had been announced. It was then announced by the government and they condemned it, but then last night they leaked to the press that they were considering supporting it. We now have a position where Labor is both condemning and considering supporting this policy because they know in their heart of hearts that the Australian public want it. Since former Prime Minister Rudd declared that 'Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time,' Labor has had 12 different policies. They have had the dirty dozen of policies. Even today they are still trying to walk both sides of the street, considering supporting our policy while condemning it at the same time. I urge them to get on board. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The honourable member's utter inability to understand the way the energy market works is really staggering. The honourable member does not understand that the electricity market works with the trading of electricity. That will continue. Retailers will be able to trade, to ensure that they meet their obligations, whether on emissions or on reliability. Really, it's no wonder South Australia's in such bad shape in terms of energy with a Labor Party led by people like the member for Port Adelaide.</span>

Here is a very simple proposition: if you can't keep the lights on, you can't run a hospital, you can't run a Whyalla steelworks and you can't run a Port Pirie metalworks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Affordable and reliable energy is critical to business and jobs, but it is also fundamental to our hospitals. We know this because we saw the Port Augusta Hospital lose power after the South Australian blackout last September, and we saw the Port Augusta Hospital lose power after its back-up failed. That meant a very simple thing. It meant that, in the member for Grey's electorate, there were risks to people who faced the need for dialysis and who needed critical care involving ventilators or humidicribs, things which are fundamental to patient safety and human safety. Running a hospital requires a stable electricity supply.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, it's almost impossible to imagine that somebody would deliberately blow up a power station in Port Augusta. But Labor deliberately blew up the Port Augusta power station.</span>

                  </a>  They blew it up. Not just figuratively but literally they blew up the Port Augusta power station. That is Labor's approach to electricity and power generation in this country. They delighted in the fact, they revelled in the fact, they cherished the fact that they figuratively and literally blew up a power station. The people of Port Augusta paid that price in two ways. They paid that price through the hip pocket from the skyrocketing prices in South Australia, but they also paid for it through the loss of stability and security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking a different approach. We have not only abolished the carbon tax; we have taken steps to abolish the limited merits review. But now the Prime Minister has put forward the National Energy Guarantee. That's both about dealing with price but, in particular, about dealing with stability. This is about ensuring that never again should the people of Port Augusta face a situation where they don't have the security that their hospital will be able to continue providing essential services. What Labor wants in the end is the alternative. They want to drive up electricity prices. They want to see a $66 billion increase in the cost of electricity, and they don't care that it puts at risk electricity stability and security. If you don't have electricity stability and security, you can't keep the lights on and you can't keep the hospitals running. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Prime Minister and the energy minister have apparently assured their party room that they will not put a price on carbon or allow carbon trading, but their latest energy policy certainly seems to put a price on carbon and involve carbon trading. Given it looks like a goat, walks like a goat and bleats like a goat, will the Prime Minister now accept the reality of his own policy or will he continue to pay homage to the volcano gods on his backbench?</span>

What do you think they're thinking? Do you think the fact that those opposite are belittling a saving of $115 a year reflects badly on them, particularly because when they were last in office power bills went up by 100 per cent? We had the dirty dozen of policies. We had hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in the small business sector, we had the dreaded $15 billion carbon tax, we had that great democratic experiment the citizens assembly, we had the cash for clunkers, we had the pink batts, we had the ETS, we had the CPRS, we had the EIS.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Labor Party has been presented with what they have asked for: an opportunity for bipartisanship based on expert advice. As I said to the House, this has received widespread support from groups like ACCI, which says, 'This policy ticks the boxes of lower prices, increased reliability and meeting our international target.' The Australian Industry Group, representing more than a million employees, said, 'The plan gives the electricity sector a great deal of flexibility and it gives welcome recognition of the imperative of maintaining trade competitiveness for emissions-intensive industries.' The National Irrigators Council, in all the regional areas across the country, has said, 'This package is welcome.' Manufacturing Australia said they've welcomed the government's new energy plan. APPEA, who represent the gas companies, said, 'This National Energy Guarantee strengthens reliability.' What about Energy Consumers Australia? I thought those opposite worried about consumers. It said, 'This policy is welcome because it integrates the need for reliable power and emissions reduction in the electricity sector, at least cost for consumers.' PwC said, 'It provides a long-awaited certainty, reliability and affordability medicine we have been looking for to treat the ills of our energy market.' This is why this policy, put forward by the experts, is deserving of bipartisan support. If you don't support it, we will, because we believe in lower power prices and a more reliable system.</span>

Of course, her electorate represents a major centre for the production and processing of red meat. As a Queenslander, I'm very pleased, like her, to say that Rockhampton is the beef capital of Australia. Whether it's the farms of the Fitzroy Plains through to the coolrooms of the meat plants in Rocky, all of them rely on affordable, reliable power. The member for Capricornia has been a very strong advocate for the people of Capricornia, not only with respect to the export of red meat but also with respect to the coalition government's strong agenda when it comes to free trade agreements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Capricornia, like me, was at the launch of the Red Meat Advisory Council's 2017 <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the industry report</span>. This report talks about the great success they've had at RMAC in exporting Australian red meat, Australian beef. That's able to be secured thanks to the free trade agreements that we've put in place and also by making sure we have kept our eye very firmly on what it takes to make Australian exporters competitiveâ€”that is, reliable and affordable energy. I note, for example, that the CEO of the meat processor JBS, which employs around 12,000 people across five states, said, 'I welcome the announcement of the government's National Energy Guarantee that, as a policy, offers a solution to lower the costs of energy, deliver reliability and underpin a competitive Australian manufacturing sector.' So there you hear it from someone who is at the epicentre of making sure our red meat exports go well and making sure we are able to export red meat, which drives economic growth and jobs in Australia. That's the reason we see some 371,500 more Australians in jobs today. It is as a consequence of our trade policies and as a consequence of our steady gaze on making sure we get the big calls right on energy policy. The simple fact is that when it comes to the opposition they get the big calls wrong. They are getting it wrong on energy policy. They sure as hell get it wrong when it comes to trade policy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't forgetâ€”and I know the people of Capricornia don't forgetâ€”Labor's call when it came to red meat exports and live cattle exports. What did they do for the people of Capricornia? They shut down the trade overnight. What did they do to our bilateral relationship with Indonesia? They junked it. The fact is that the coalition is going to provide reliable, affordable energy. The coalition is going to provide the right economic conditions for 371,000 more Australians to have jobs, as a result of our free trade deals, and only the coalition will deliver the policy certainty to make sure that Australians have jobs into the future and have reliable and affordable energy.</span>

I don't have any notes, just like the member for Maribyrnong has no vision, has no policy plan when it comes to energy and, quite frankly, as many say, has no scruples.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as the member for Flynn's question is concerned, he would buy and sell most of those oppositeâ€”all of those opposite, in factâ€”before breakfast when it comes to business acumen, and they should know that. He represents 16,821 small businesses in his electorate. One of those is Biggenden Meatworks, run by Peter Gibbs. It is the biggest employer in that little townâ€”52 people, it employsâ€”and it is one of the largest employers in the North Burnett. Peter's energy usage has halved, and yet his energy costs have risen by more than 70 per cent. This has to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tim Rose, who runs Southern Oil Refining in my hometown of Wagga Wagga, also has an oil refinery in Gladstone. The member for Flynn and I opened that particular facility, and they employ a lot of people. The energy bill that Tim is paying in Wagga Wagga at his Southern Oil refinery has risen by $140,000 per year. That's the equivalent of two jobs. Two jobs mightn't seem much to those opposite, but in the Northern Oil Refinery in Gladstone his energy costs are even higher. This has to stop, and it is stopping because of the National Energy Guarantee providing affordable and reliable power and providing a policy initiative those opposite would never come up with, because they've got no vision. They've got no plan. They are just subservient to the unions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a plan. We have reserved gas exports for domestic supply. We have abolished the limited merits review. There is Snowy 2.0, in the member for Eden-Monaro's electorate. He should be more supportive of that because it is going to provide not just thousands of jobs in the building and construction phase, but, indeed, power for half a million homes and small businesses on the eastern grid. Not only that, but for Adaminaby, Cooma, Tumut and Talbingo it's providing an upsurge in their local economies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I'm asked what the threats are. The threats are those opposite, because they are a job-destroying party. We are the party for small business. That's why we have lowered the tax rate to 27Â½ per cent, the lowest it's been since 1940â€”the lowest it's been for 77 years. We have alsoâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given we are now in the fifth year of this Prime Minister's mismanagement of the NBN, isn't it clear that Australians are suffering with a second-rate NBN and that the Prime Minister is entirely to blame?</span>

She represents an electorate that when the Labor Party left power had zero premises connected to the fibre network. In the electorate of Dobell today 57,898 premises are connected to the fixed network, connected to the NBN. The Labor Party, when they shuffled out of office with an ignominious a track record of rank incompetence when it comes to the NBN, had barely 50,000 premises connected to the fixed network. They had spent $6 billion. They had consistently missed their targets for the rollout. And we are now at a point where over six million premises are able to connectâ€”35,000 premises connecting each week, and we are on track to have this rollout completed by 2020â€”</span>

They came nowhere near getting it done in eight years, and with every year they were in government they fell further and further behind. Of course the member can always bring forward instances in which a constituent had an unsatisfactory experience, and of course we will engage with that. The Minister for Communications has already responded to the member about two instances she raised this week with a commitment that work will be underway on one next monthâ€”the Rudolf Steiner Schoolâ€”and work will be underway on the other with the aim to have the premises connected by December of this year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a great year for 371,500 Australians who are in a job today and weren't in a job 12 months ago, but it's been a bad year for thousands of visa holders who have committed crimes. We have been able to cancel now a record number of visas of noncitizensâ€”people who have committed crimes, including armed robbery; 246 visa holders have had their visa cancelled, 478 for drug offences, 56 for murder and almost 250 for child pornography and child sex offences. We are making Australia a safer place, and we are doing it off the back of expert advice. We have spent a lot of time with the law enforcement and intelligence agencies in this country to work out how we can keep Australia safeâ€”not only how we can keep our borders secure but how we can work across the community to identify people who have committed serious offences against Australian citizens and, most importantly, against women and children, and deport them from the country so they no longer pose a threat to us. The advice is that this will have a positive intergenerational impact on crime in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have listened to the experts. We have stared down the Labor Party, because they are dictated to by the Greens; they've been overtaken by Left ideology in this country. That is why we have knocked them out of the way. We have stared down the naysayers in the Labor Party and we have made this country a safer place. The reality, as has been demonstrated this week, is that the Labor Party has not learnt the lesson in relation to border protection. They ignored the advice from the experts, and people drowned at sea. Fifty thousand people came on 800 boats. They ignored the advice when they were in government and they refused to cancel the section 501 visas of those people that had committed serious offences. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has acted on advice. Similarly this week, as we have demonstrated, we have acted on the advice of the experts in relation to energy. We are listening to the Australian public, to mums and dads, to families in small businesses, to people across the country who are hurting; people who are hurting with higher electricity bills; people such as those in South Australia who are having their lights turned out by a Labor government policy which is crippling small business and families. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHAMPION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  It is a sad duty to have to address the House on this MPI. I would rather not have done it. I would rather have not seen the closure of this great industry, the car industry. We remember the history that lies behind this industry. In November 1948, as the Leader of the Opposition says, Ben Chifley watched the first car line off the line at Fishermans Bend, the 48-215â€”or, as it's known, the FX Holden. Every Prime Minister, from Chifley to Rudd, respected that industryâ€”knew it was important for our national identity, our research and development, our industrial capacity and Australian jobs. Even you, Mr Speaker, know how important Holden was to the psyche of communities and to the identity of our country, because we all had a Holden and we all had relatives who worked in Holden factories or in car component factories. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry was in the fabric of our country. It was important to our postwar identity, as important as the Snowy scheme, as important as all of the things we have doneâ€”the science, the progress, the development, the industrial capacity. There were 50,000 direct jobs and 200,000 indirect jobs, not just in South Australia, not just in Elizabeth, but in the southern suburbs in Adelaide, in the western suburbs of Adelaide, in western Sydney, in Victoriaâ€”thousands and thousands of jobs in components, in research and development, blue collar and white collar, and the thousands of indirect jobs that hung off it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a critically important industry. What have we had post the Rudd government? I will tell you what we have had. We have had a government determined not just to be cavalier about this industry, not just to be indifferent about this industry. We have had a government that bragged about it amongst its cabinet ministers. The then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, and the then Treasurer, Mr Hockey, bragged off the record about who put the torpedo in the water. I remember reading about that in a Phil Coorey article. We know when the day of judgement came that the car industry did not receive support; rather, they were dared to leave. Who can forget the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>: 'Hockey dares GM to leave'? The opening line of that article by Phil Coorey and Ben Potter stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The federal government has accused General Motors Holden of ingratitude and effectively issued the company its marching orders, making it likely the auto makerâ€™s departure is a formality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A formalityâ€”50,000 jobs wiped. Now we see the consequences of that. Time and time again, we have seen closure after closure, job after job gone, and the slow winding down of this industry. Tomorrow, in my electorate, the last car will come off the line, a VF Commodoreâ€”a red line. It is the best car that Holden has ever produced. It is a great car. With the dollar where it is now, it would have been exported to the United States. The Chevy SS would have been exported. The Caprice would have been exported to the US police car market. With the dollar where it is now, this industry, instead of closing down, would have been thrivingâ€”not just surviving but thrivingâ€”if they had had a government that backed them in, but they didn't have that. Abbott didn't back them in. Hockey didn't back them in. Turnbull didn't back them in.</span>

                  </a>  The current Prime Minister, as the shadow Treasurer reminds me. We know when Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, was asked what he thought about this industry, he said, 'Oh well, they have to work on their productivity.' That is what he said to workers at the time. These are the workers who carved $20 million in costs out of enterprise bargaining agreements and other work practices. They were doing their bit to secure a billion dollars worth of assistance. They were doing their bit to keep these high-wage, high-skilled jobs in the country. What was the attitude of the Prime Minister to these workers? It was not only one of ignoring themâ€”it's galling that this government wants to pretend that this industry is not closing, that it doesn't even existâ€”but that the Prime Minister went kayaking on Friday. He went kayaking in some social media stunt. He went down and took a tram somewhere. This is what is supposed to be industrial policy in this country? Rather than defending high-skill, high-wage jobs, the governmentâ€”which is full of guilty peopleâ€”have put this industry to the sword and have done so much damage, as they have done in so many other areas, with anaemic wage growth, entry level jobs basically being carved out of the system and attack after attack on the unemployed. What are they doing for jobs in this country? They are closing the one big industry in South Australiaâ€”50,000 jobs. This will reverberate across the countryâ€”make absolutely no mistake about it. </span>

Normally, when there are tough conditions, when there are economic winds buffeting, a Prime Minister would show up. Prime Minister Rudd showed up. He showed up at Holden. Gillardâ€”she showed up. But what has Turnbull done? What we just heard from the minister at the table and what we heard in question time was bragging about jobs growth.</span>

We have the government bragging during question time about their performance, when they have anaemic wage growth and when they have got people under pressure. What will this closure do?

Let's not pretendâ€”as the government wants to do and will no doubt do in a second when they get up and brag about jobs growthâ€”as if that's some sort of camouflage for their performance. There could be more jobs in the economy. Imagine if you didn't close the car industry, you could really get up and brag. We have a gutless Prime Minister. We have a Prime Minister who is guilty of the destruction of this industry and who won't go down to Holden Elizabeth as Chifley did. He won't go down there and make a comment about the last car coming off the line. He won't show up in SA and give us some idea about how our economy might transition.</span>

They say, 'Go out there and get another job.' That's difficult to do if you're a mature-age worker, that's difficult to do if you have been on WorkCover and that's difficult to do if you don't have easily translatable skills.</span>

I have a little printoutâ€”a little pictureâ€”of that car. It's a beautiful car, but it doesn't have a Prime Minister next to it. It doesn't have a government minister taking responsibility for this. They just sit there, stone-facedly ignoring the problem, pretending it is not happening and pretending that this violent destruction of Australian jobsâ€”of high-skill, high-wage, important jobs in an iconic industryâ€”is not happening. They want to pretend that this is not happening.</span>

Manufacturing in South Australia, in the smart manufacturing sector, has produced 3,700 jobs in the last year alone. Since the coalition came to office in 2013, there are 825,000 new jobs circulating in the Australian economy. In the last 12 months alone there have been 371,000 new jobs, of which 80 per cent are full-time jobs. Employment has increased very strongly this year, rising by 3.1 per cent, well above the average rate of only 1.6 per cent over the decade. In fact, it's the highest jobs growth rate since 2008 and it's the longest run of growth and employment that we have had since 2004. That's why I can see why the member for Wakefield was sorry he brought this up as an MPI. Normally, they are meant to be bagging us about bad figures and bad outcomes, but we have got these fantastic employment growth figures.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has failed working Australians. They abandoned the blue-collar workers that depend on a reliable energy scheme and guaranteed dispatchable energy. Under six years of Labor, unemployment grew by 203,000. When the member for Maribyrnong was the Minister for Workplace Relations, unemployment numbers grew by 77,000. Labor made it hard for businesses to employ people because of the $9 billion carbon tax impost. They abolished the Building and Construction Commission, so lawlessness, intimidation and rorts re-entered the construction industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As opposed to that, we have really got some great outcomes. As I said, in South Australia they are transitioning to a new manufacturing base, with 3,700 new advanced manufacturing jobs in the last year. Those opposite go on about Holden closing, but who was in charge when Mitsubishi closed in 2008? The other side was. There were 1,000 people put out of work. That's not even factoring in the $66 billion impost that their energy system would impose on businesses in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have addressed the fundamentals. We have got the biggest infrastructure build going on in Australian federal historyâ€”$75 billion worth of infrastructure. We have put tax cuts in place for small businesses, down to 27Â½ per cent. Those opposite said that was going to lose money, but company tax revenue shot up in the last budgetary figures. Now the deficit has been reduced by $4.4 billion, mainly on the back of increased company tax income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On threats to employment, I think the biggest threat to employment is the people on the other side. They are proposing a $66 billion tax on the energy bills that everyone, including businesses, has to pay. The only thing that's worse than expensive energy is no energy, and their systems have delivered exactly that in South Australia. We have people and large businesses with incredible fears and concerns about proposed blackouts in this coming summer. The Energy Guarantee and the changes to the energy market will stop that happening because there will be a guarantee that energy is supplied 99.98 per cent of the time. As I said, the only thing worse than unaffordable energy is no energy, and that's what the country's going to get if the other side are running the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are putting in other forms of infrastructure. In my electorate we've seen 990 direct jobs and over 2,000 indirect jobs out of the Pacific Highway construction boom between the Oxley Highway and Kempsey. We've had an absolute boom in aged-care construction. We have had over 750 construction jobs created as a result of the expansion in aged-care facilities in Gloucester, Taree, Forster and Hawks Nest in my own electorate. That's been echoed and mirrored around the whole country. Through Minister Wyatt's aged-care expansion, growth is exponentially being improved. With that growth in aged-care facilities comes long-term employment. In my electorate of Lyne, that amounts to 400 long-term local, reliable jobs in the aged-care industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have particular programs for unemployed youth aged 15 to 24. Our Youth Jobs PaTH: Prepare, Trial, Hire program is delivering major dividends for young unemployed. At the moment there are 711 interns engaged in this. There are 643 that have recently been appointed to long-term employment as a result of it, and another 11,600 young people have been employed through the youth bonus wage subsidy. So infrastructure and tax cuts are delivering growth in the economy, and that's why our company tax returns are up and unemployment figures are down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other infrastructure is delivering dividends. We've got our National Rail Program. The Inland Rail is going to deliver more growth and more transport efficiencies and allow the hinterland of New South Wales, Victoria and up into South-East Queensland grow because it will be connected to an avenue of commerce. We have the Western Sydney Airport Corporation delivering the Western Sydney Airport. That's going to create another 20,000 jobs by the early 2030s. And there will be 60,000 new jobs from the economic opportunities that will flourish with the $5.3 billion in equity and the development of the Western Sydney Airport. There is our Regional Growth Fund, with $472 million to promote regional infrastructure growth, and the Building Better Regions Fund, which is another $200 million. The biggest infrastructure program is Inland Rail. That is really going to be a structural change that will allow inland Australia to flourish, just as the development of rail across the nation opened up areas north and south during the John Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We realised we need more skilled tradespeople, so we have a Skilling Australia Fund which is delivering $1Â½ billion to state and territory governments over the first four years. It will prioritise development of apprenticeships and traineeships. With matched state and territory funding, we think there will be support for 300,000 apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeships and trainees. We will get more skilled Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're trying to get young parents who have dropped out of the labour market back into it with our $263 million investment in the ParentsNext Fund. We have particular packages in place for Indigenous employment. We've got a new career transition assistance program and we've got a better jobseeker compliance network. But it is the fundamentals that are driving the growth in jobs. We are trying to deliver efficiencies and we are helping small business. We've given them a tax cut and they get a better return on investment, which gives them the confidence to employ people. By simplifying all their reporting requirements, we are trying to help small businesses get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the building and construction industry, we are bringing the rule of law back so that building is more cost-efficient, prices are lower and we can get much better growth in the construction industry, which, in the North Coast, is probably the biggest growth area of employment, along with disability care. The digital economy is also booming, courtesy of all the initiatives that we have put in place. It is embarrassing that the member for Wakefield chose to make an MPI about unemploymentâ€”or, rather, growth of employmentâ€”when we've got the best figures we've had in more than a decade.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  I just listened to the assistant minister. He bragged about job figures, but did not say one word of consolation to the workers who are losing their jobs tomorrow. Not one word of consolation did he offer them and their families about the jobs they've lost. Indeed, he argued this issue shouldn't be brought to the floor of the parliament. Well, I am proud to support the member for Wakefield, who has been doing an enormous job over many years supporting those workers at Holden as they face an unknown future. It is disingenuous of this assistance minister to come in and not even say, 'I'm sorry you're losing your jobs, and I'm sorry your future is uncertain now.' And now he runs out of the chamberâ€”that is what we expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But tomorrow is an incredibly sad day. It's a sad day for those in Elizabeth, it's a sad day for Adelaide and it's a sad day for this nation. It is the loss of an iconic brand, the loss of an innovative industry and the loss of skills and expertise. Looking at how it all sums up, Julia Gillard described the potential of car manufacturing: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦Chifley wasn't just launching a car, he was building a nationâ€”taking Australia into a future beyond wool and wheat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the industry lasted for seven decades, producing high-quality cars made by highly skilled workers at the forefront of innovation. These workers are casualties of this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe I could stomach it if it were just indifference by this governmentâ€”if it were just their not being active players and just letting this important industry go by the wayside. But it was not indifference that led to this. It was not incompetenceâ€”although I could raise many examples of where this government is incompetent. But it wasn't incompetence; it was pure, evil ideology that did not want to support an industry in Australia. I am not sure why; I am not sure whether they thought it was too unionisedâ€”I wouldn't put it past themâ€”or whether they don't like building things and prefer to just take minerals out of the ground. Whatever the reason, it was an active decision by this government, the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, and also the current Prime Minister and the then Treasurer and the current Treasurer. They all sat around that cabinet table and made the decision. They might argue now that they had nothing to do with it, that it wasn't actually their decision. But we know. I was in this parliament when Joe Hockey, the then Treasurer, told Holden to 'put up or pack up'. That was the message he sent: put up or pack up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will read to you from an article back in 2013:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Holden remains unconvinced that the federal government intends providing any further assistance to the industry after 2016 â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was at a critical moment in time, when Holden were deciding their future, and they went to the government and said, 'Please, we need some assistance for a long-term future,' and the government said no. The government said, 'We will not support you.' It was an outrageous decision that has led to the position we are in today. And of course the casualty is not just those Holden workers; it is components manufacturing right across South Australia, and in my own electorate it is being affected as well. Over the past few months we have seen job losses at Walker's Tenneco and 70 job losses at Monroe. This is just the start. We're looking at close to 12,000 jobs in total. The assistant minister who spoke previously said that perhaps these workers will take the Pathways program and get an internship while they're on the dole. That's a great option for them! Maybe they'll just work casually in aged care? What the assistant minister failed to recognise is that these workers who are losing their jobs are highly skilled and have a huge amount of technical ability. They need to be deployed in a way that is useful and productive for this country. Instead, their jobs have been ripped away by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember the respect this government has for South Australian workers. We remember when the then defence minister said that ASC workers 'couldn't even build a canoe'. That is the respect that this government gives to blue-collar workers in South Australia, workers who have a huge amount of technicality: they ignore them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  Talk about leading with the chin! The topic for today's matter of public importance is an absolute crackerâ€”an absolute cracker. Here we have a situation where Australia is experiencing the strongest growth in full-time jobs in its history. Never has it recorded this strength in full-time jobs growth. We've now had 12 consecutive months of jobs growth. We have not seen that in 23 years. The unemployment rate is now 5.5 per cent. And some very smart person in the opposition decided that they want to have a crack at the Australian government, the Turnbull government, on jobs? It's bizarreâ€”but we welcome it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was wondering who in their right mind, from the Labor Party, would actually want to debate the topic of jobs with the Turnbull government, which has such a demonstrable track record. And I see here that it was actually the member for Wakefield. I believe the member for Wakefield is a member in South Australia. It is quite possible that, as a South Australian, he wrote this topic in the dark. It is quite possible that the lights weren't on. The lights may not have been on when he tried to pen this topic, because as we know South Australia, as an economy, and therefore its workers, has been damaged time and time again by their Labor state government. It is quite possible therefore that the member for Wakefield, in putting this topic forward today, is in fact talking about not the Australian government but the South Australian state Labor governmentâ€”a government that has totally misused the energy system and has nearly destroyed that economy. That, indeed, is worth criticising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are looking for work, people just can't find work and, indeed, many are now losing their jobsâ€”and it happens every day across the world. Members opposite have mentioned the car industry, but it is a tough, tough time for anybody. It's not just a financial problem; there are a whole mix of social issues and of personal relationship issues that often come to into play when one is faced with unemployment. That is when you need government to ensure that it is the enabler for economic growth. For those who are wondering about their future employment, particularly in South Australia, despite having such a disastrous state government rest assured that the coalition government is fighting for you. We have the largest recapitalisation program in the history of the Australian Defence Forceâ€”$200 billion to be spent over a 10-year period. A big share of that will be going to South Australia. It will be home to a shipbuilding program delivering 8,000 local jobs. Rest assured that this government is delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a reason why we have results on the scoreboard. We now have created 825,500 jobs. Let me correct what I just saidâ€”the stat is right, but the government hasn't created the jobs; the coalition government has created the environment for 825,500 extra jobs. Under the Labor Party's six years in office, do you know how many they created or enabled to be created? It was the opposite. There were over 200,000 extra people in the job queue. It is time that the members opposite turned on the lights, looked at the scoreboard and understood that there's only one side of this parliament that enables economic growth and job creation, and that's the coalition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  It's my great pleasure and honour to speak on this matter of public importance on employment, proposed by the member for Wakefield. The member for Wakefield, over a number of years now, has given extraordinary voice to the shock, the dislocation, the distress and also the dignity of the community of northern Adelaide, particularly his community around Elizabeth, which is going to be so enormously impacted by the closure of the Holden factory tomorrow. Also impacted will be those supply companies that have grown up and operated for so many decades in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, also in the western suburbs of Adelaide that I represent, in the southern suburbs that are represented by the member for Kingston and in the north-eastern suburbs represented by the member for Makin. Holden really has been the outstanding icon of the South Australian economy, stretching back many, many decades. I want to be able to pay tribute to that icon and, most importantly, to the thousands and thousands of South Australians who, over the decades, have worked for Holden and who have worked for the supply companies that have supplied Holden and the other car manufacturing factories like Chrysler and Mitsubishi that have, over the decades, operated in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people don't know that Holden is a 160-year-old company. It has been operating in South Australia since the middle part of the 19th century. It started as a saddlery business but took the decision in the early 20th century to shift into automotive manufacturing. It didn't build its own iconic Australian car until 1948, as the member for Wakefield has pointed out, but for decades it had the contract to build and assemble cars from American manufacturers, particularly General Motors. In 1924 it built a factory in Woodvilleâ€”the suburb where I live, in the western suburbs of Adelaideâ€”that operated until the 1980s, building GM cars and then building the Holden. Down at Old Parliament House this morning we had one of the 1952 Holdens that was built at the Woodville plant. A cluster of supply companies built up at the same time and have continued operating in the decades since in the western suburbsâ€”some of them around the corner from my house, one still on the Woodville site, just behind the Bunnings factory, aiAutomotive, and many others as well. Before the war they also built a plant in Birkenhead, Port Adelaide, again in my electorate, employing many thousands of members of the western suburbs community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 1930s Holden had signed a contract to shift their entire South Australian operation to Fishermans Bend, which would've been devastating for a South Australia that was trying to industrialise at the time. They were convinced to keep their operations in South Australia, and the rest has been history. For eight decades this has been, along with the steel blast furnace at Whyalla, one of the twin pillars of the South Australian postwar economy, around which so much research and skills development has grown. Most importantly, so many families' lives have been built around the opportunity to work at the Holden plant at Woodville, at Birkenhead and, since the fifties, out at Elizabeth in the member for Wakefield's electorate. It has been an extraordinary part not only of economy but also of our culture. We always supported the Holden car against the Ford car at Mount Panorama. It was always a big part of our pride, and tomorrow all of that ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow will be a tragedy for the community in South Australia, particularly in the northern suburbs of Adelaide but also in other parts of Adelaide where those supply companies are such an important part of the manufacturing economy. The University of Adelaide says that the closure of the automotive industry will cost 24,000 jobs. In a small state like South Australia, that will have a devastating impact not just on the economy but on families. School principals in my electorate have for a couple of years now been talking about the distress that their children are evincing because they're worried about what Mum and Dad are going to do after this closure. This was an avoidable decision. As my colleagues have said, this was an act of massive economic self-harm by this government, for which the current Prime Minister also owns part-responsibility as a member of the cabinet at the time. At this time I pay tribute particularly to the work of Holden's workforce now, putting out the highest quality cars, I'm told by the member for Wakefield, of any factory GM runs across the planet. This has been an extraordinary part of South Australia's history; I wish it were part of its future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  I would hope that the local member representing the electorate where the job losses are to be faced tomorrow has been working closely with the union, Centrelink and financial advisers. Some of those losing work with this change will find a new direction. Others will move to compatible and technical employment. It's a tough time, but Aussies are tough. The change is stressful and emotional. But I find sometimes that Labor would rather the Australian nation spend valuable taxpayer dollars to support an industry that had been depending on a government subsidy for some years. They worry about closing certain industries, yet they had six years to incentivise the closing companies to develop alternative manufacturing pathways, as clearly needed to be done. The decision to close many of the operations was in progress during Labor's time in government. Australians themselves did not support our car industry. We didn't all buy Fords and Holdens, nor even Toyotas. A government cannot have a continuous subsidy scheme. There needs to be an operational change to build sustainability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sit here sometimes and I wonder about this, but today I think I finally discovered the answer. It seems to me that those with business experience who kept accounts information knew that everything that was positive was in the black. Money in the bank was written in black. But everything that had to be paid was in red. If the number in the black column was bigger than in the red column then we knew we were doing okay. But the Labor Party see the red side as the correct sideâ€”the bigger the number on the red side, the happier they are. In fact, when they see whopping big employment numbers on the black side, they think that's a bad thing and say the government is losing jobs. I get it. I finally understand. It's that they don't know how to read the accounting books properly. In my community, they know that not being able to read the accounting books properly is actually not a really good skill. Everyone knows that would be a rubbish strategy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> on 16 September this year talked about all the additional jobs that have been created in the first eight months of the year. It was preceded earlier in June by information from <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Insider </span>that again the jobs growth was huge. And today we announced we've got 371,500 more jobs. They are not equally distributed around our nation but certainly indicate we are going in the right direction. Some of the reasons for this increase in employment relate to the natural growth in the jobs market, the increased business confidence and the stability of a government intent on reducing the red side of the taxpayers' accounting books, but they also relate to active policy changes to encourage employers to take on more staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January this year, a number of incentives were put in place. A wage subsidy of up to $10,000 is now available to qualified businesses who employ eligible jobseekers. Some administrative changes also helped. Wage subsidies are being paid over six months instead of 12 months and an optional kickstart payment of up to 40 per cent of the wage subsidy is available for four weeks after the job begins. Minimum working hours are able to be 20 hours per week over the six-month term. There's a new youth bonus wage subsidy of up to $10,000 for employers who hire eligible jobseekers between 15 and 24 years of age. There are other sectors of the jobs market that also attract employer subsidies, and interested employers should contact their local job service providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would suggest that Labor, rather than extolling the virtues of a budget that remains in the red, look more carefully at the opportunities for our working Australians and those wanting to work. Let's develop policies to grow enterprising skills among young employees, as these are likely to be the most critical skills for jobs of the future. Based on government projections, Australia will have between 5.6 million and 6.4 million job changes up to 2025. In 10 years Australia will have jobs we haven't dreamt of, but we know very many well-known occupations will still be in high demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final point relates to the absolute correlation between the cost of energy and jobs. It's simple, really: the higher the price of energy, the fewer the jobs; and the lower the reliability of energy, the higher the employment numbers. Labor really need to look at the red and the black sides and realise that deficits and negative balances in government are not desirable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  When Ben Chifley in 1948 launched the first Holden off the assembly line, it was a proud moment for Australia, as the headline in this newspaper I am holding clearly shows. Tomorrow will be a sad day for Australia. On Sunday I went out to Elizabeth, to a function organised by Holden for the local community there. I was there with the member for Wakefield. Every model of every Holden ever made was on display. It was a visual presentation of the work, innovation, design and contribution to Australia and the Australian economy that Holden has made for almost 70 years. Since 1948, 7.5 million cars have been produced by Holden, with 45 different models. Into each of those models went design and innovation. Seven decades of Australians not only built those cars but built a life for themselves and their families either working for Holden or working for one of its component manufacturers. Holden, as the member for Wakefield quite rightly pointed out, was not just a brand. It was an iconic, unique Australian brand. Some members might recall the ad: 'football, meat pies, kangaroos and Holden cars'. It became part of the Australian psyche. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday there was another very clear message from that event, as I spoke to Holden executives that are still with the company right now. Their clear message to me was that Holden would have stayed in Australia but for the negative attitude towards them from the Abbott-Turnbull coalition government. Holden was forced out of Australia by this coalition government, and it was this coalition government that turned on Holden. This will go down as one of the worst decisions ever made by an Australian government. Not only did Holden get pushed out of Australia; with them went Toyota, because Toyota had made it absolutely clear in the days before it happened that one car maker alone in Australia would not survive. They said that to the sham Productivity Commission inquiry that was underway at the time. Holden had two new models on the line, and Toyota had a strong export business going at the time. As Mike Devereux, the Holden chief executive at the time, pointed out, the car-making industry and Holden's contribution to Australia was $33 billion, or 18 times the level of assistance they were receiving. Those figures have never been disputed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was one of 13 countries that could design and make a car from start to finish. Of the G20 countries, only Saudi Arabia did not make cars, and now Australia will join them. Indeed, while Australia joins them, Saudi Arabia is going in the opposite direction and wanting to get into the car-making business. The loss of car making in this country wasn't just a loss of car making in its own right but a loss of manufacturing capability, including the massive loss of seven decades of research, design, expertise and skills that had built up over that time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For South Australia, the cuts will be terrible. Twenty-four thousand jobs or thereabouts will be lost. The economy will take a $3.7 billion hit. The social costs, whether in unemployment, housing stress or health effects, are already being seen. In the Playford council area, where the unemployment rate is 15 per cent, and in Elizabeth, where it is 32 per cent, it will hit hard. So let's not talk about employment figures elsewhere in Australia. Holden's closure is this government's present to the people of the northern suburbs of Adelaide for Christmas. It is shameful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make another point about the stupidity of this decision. The two car makers were producing nearly 200,000 cars a year at the time. That is going to affect our balance of trade, because all of those cars will now have to come in from overseas, or it will be a loss of export.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish on this point. I take this opportunity to thank the people who, over seven decades, made South Australia proud to be the home of Holden, and Australians proud to drive a Holden. It's the car I drive. They showed that Australia could build a world-class car, and for seven decades we did that. I certainly wish them well in their endeavours to get work elsewhere, but I know how disappointed they are that their jobs have come to an end. I repeat what I said earlier: this would have to go down as one of the worst decisions ever made by a government, certainly in my lifetime.</span>

                  <a href="248969" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I'm very surprised by this matter of public importance from the member for Wakefield, claiming that Australians are losing their jobs because of this government when in fact it is the very opposite. We currently have the strongest full-time jobs growth in Australia's history. In my electorate of Dunkley, in fact, unemployment increased under Labor, peaking at 6.2 per cent at the end of their terms of government in September 2013. In March 2017, after four years of coalition government, it dropped to 5.4 per cent, on the latest Dunkley-specific figures that I have. This compares very favourably to national figures. We have seen the unemployment rate decrease by 0.1 of a percentage point over the last month, to 5.5 per cent in September 2017. We've seen over 825,000 jobs created under our government, with employment standing at a record high of over 12.2 million jobs in September 2017. The participation rate is at a five-year high, and jobs growth is the highest since 2008. Over the last 12 months, 371,000 jobs were created. We've also seen, under this government, employment increase strongly, rising by 3.1 per cent over the last year, well above the decade average rate of 1.6 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically in Dunkley, since I was elected, the federal government has made over 200 different funding investments, many of which contribute to jobs growth locally. One key investment is the $4 million going towards our Dunkley rail plan, which will be a business case to extend Metro rail from Frankston to Baxter. This project in and of itself will create 4,000 jobs, cutting unemployment in our area by up to one per cent. It will reduce youth disengagement by two per cent, increase local university enrolment by up to 20 per cent and provide hospital accessibility. But, unlike their federal counterparts, Victorian state Labor decided to delay this jobs growth over the past 12 months by stopping our federally funded business case going ahead. Only after a year of continual advocacy by me and the minister have they finally signed off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On similar matters, federal Labor are worse than their state counterparts, and they were even worse when they were in government. To start with, they want to increase our energy costs, which will only make it harder for businesses to create more jobs. Labor failed working Australians. Under six years of their government, the jobless queues grew by around 203,000. In the period that the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Workplace Relations, the number of unemployed people increased by around 77,000 while his government was busy signing off on more and more 457 visas. Consider, for example, that when Labor were in government previously they made it harder for businesses to employ people by hitting them with a $9 billion-a-year carbon tax, hitting them with a mining tax and abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commissionâ€”all things that contributed to Labor losing government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we have a plan to grow the economy and create new jobs. To this end we have, for example, included in the latest budget $75 billion in infrastructure funding from now until 2026-27. We've cut the tax rate for small businesses to 27.5 per cent. We've also invested in the establishment of a $10 billion National Rail Program to deliver rail projects that better connect our cities and regions and create job opportunities. I hope that once the state government figures out that the Baxter electrification in my electorate of Dunkley is a good thing it will contribute state funding, and then the federal government could co-contribute to this important local project. We've got the Regional Growth Fund, which will invest $472 million in regional infrastructure projects. And we've also seen several successful programs in Dunkley funded by the federal government, such as those via the Brotherhood of St Laurence or the Work for the Dole program within vision services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I say to the member for Wakefield and Labor: stop the falsities and tell the truthâ€”coalition governments create jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  It is with great sadness that I too rise today to speak on this matter of public importanceâ€”Australians losing their jobs because of this government. It is very sad to see that one of our iconic manufacturers in this country, which has been producing cars for over 70 years, is shutting its doors tomorrow. It has been not only producing and manufacturing cars but skilling people, creating jobsâ€”jobs of the future as wellâ€”and helping build the nation through the car manufacturing industry. With an issue as important as this one in the Houseâ€”it is something that is so important to all of us in South Australia and all the SA MPs, especially on this sideâ€”it really surprised me, in listening to the different speeches of members opposite, to find that they have no understanding and no real idea of the car industry and car manufacturing. We heard, for example, the member for Gilmoreâ€”and I am glad that she is here in the chamberâ€”say we can't go on subsidising industries. I have to tell you, all you have to do is go to the library and they will get the figures for you, as they got them for me a couple of years ago. You have a look at every car manufacturing country in the world and every single one subsidises their industry. They subsidise their industry because they know of the value-adding to the economy. You have a look at Germany, the US, Brazil, Thailand, Korea and Japan: they all have a subsidy for each assembly line worker working on a production line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were one of the lowest subsidies in the worldâ€”the lowest, not the highest. We weren't subsidising to keep an industry going; we were subsidising because we knew it value-added to the economy. It created jobs and had a spin-off for small manufacturers. It ensured we created technologies and different industries. If we look at General Motors Holden in Australia, we were one of the only nations in the worldâ€”one of 13 nationsâ€”that could create a motor vehicle from the idea to the design to the showroom in the caryard. Those were the skills that we developed in this nation, and to see Holden shutting down is very sad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The end of motor vehicle production in this country was not inevitable. The people in this country know who to blame. The Liberal Party is to blame, including Joe Hockey, now the ambassador to the US. I am glad to see he was looked after with a good golden handshake, unlike the Holden workers tomorrow who will be leaving those factory gates not knowing what their future holds. The former Prime Minister and, of course, the current Prime Minister have destroyed an industry that was a good industry, which created jobs and ensured that it created technology and industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at South Australia for a moment, with the next batch of job losses. We know that the closure of Holden has a spin-off of approximately 50,000 jobs that will be lost. That's 50,000 jobs, and we could have done something. We all remember your Treasurer in this place; we remember him very well. He goaded Holden and told them to basically leave the country. We remember Mr Devereux, the chairman of GMH, in a front-page article in July 2013, saying: 'If this government tries to mess with our subsidies or mess with us, we will leave.' That is exactly what happened. We remember that speech here in this place by your Treasurer, who absolutely goaded them out of this countryâ€”Holden could have still been there today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the people of South Australia will remember, and they know who to blame. They will know. I dare those mentioned on the other sideâ€”the Prime Minister and othersâ€”to come out to the suburbs of Adelaide, as the last Holden car comes off the production line, and meet the workers as they leave the gates of the manufacturing factory that they have worked at for years and leave their manufacturing, high-skill jobs to go home to their families for an uncertain future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">GMH gave work to many people; one of those people who worked there was my father. He came off a boat in the early fifties and, on his second day in Australia, he started at Fishermans Bend. From Fishermans Bend he went to the Woodville factory in South Australia. From there, he was transferred to Elizabeth and spent most of his working life there. I know the importance of that and how it put food and bread on our table. This closure is a travesty and it should not have happened. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  If those opposite wanted to talk about Holden, why didn't they move a matter of public importance on Holden rather than this bizarre matter of public importance? It's another bizarre matter of public importance from those opposite that talks about Australians losing their jobs because of this government, which, as we know, is not the case. Since we have been in government in 2013, we have created an extra 825,500 jobs. The matter of public importance makes no sense whatsoever but that's really what we expect from those opposite. Very often they don't make much sense at all. I can tell you that what really makes no sense are the state Labor government in South Australia's energy policies that have seen us end up with the most expensive electricity in the worldâ€”not just in the nation, but in the worldâ€”and successive blackouts. The state Labor government have been in power for 16 long years and they have delivered a disaster to my home state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know why power is importantâ€”without affordable and reliable electricity, there won't be any jobs in Australia because employers won't be able to afford to employ people in those jobs. When electricity prices are too high and when electricity is unreliable, we hurt jobs, and that's what's happened in South Australia. This was the very clear message that I heard from my local employers at a forum that I held with the Minister for the Environment and Energy. I'm grateful to the minister for travelling to South Australia to talk to my businesses direct about the skyrocketing power prices in South Australia, what it means for them as employers and what it may mean for jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses in my home state of South Australia and in my electorate of Boothby are already doing it really tough thanks to the Weatherill Labor government's complete mismanagement of the South Australian economy. My businesses do not have the capacity to absorb the horrific electricity price hikes that will kick in on 1 January for many businesses. There is no employer being left untouched by this energy crisis in South Australia created by the South Australian Labor Party. I pray that those opposite, with their very irresponsible policies that they would implement if they were elected, will not be elected. I will be doing my very best to make sure that they're not, because if they are we will see the power situation worsen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our hotels, motels and pubs, who employ thousands of South Australians, are facing increases of 50 per cent in their power costs. Some businesses have told me that their power bills will be an extra $750,000 a year as of next year. That is unbelievable, and I do not know how those businesses will be able to absorb those costs. Some local supermarkets, for example, are facing up to a 72 per cent increase in their electricity bills, and others have bills that are doubling. We're talking of a lot of them, because they are relatively energy-intensive usersâ€”they have a lot of refrigerators and freezers and a lot of lights. We're looking at bills heading into millions of dollars of increased energy costs to them. These independent supermarkets, in particular, who employ about 5,500 South Australians across the state, are going to have to find these millions of dollars from somewhere to meet the cost of keeping their lights on and the fridges and the freezers running.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has had to budget for extra millions of dollars to build or buy generators so that when we start our Defence shipbuilding program we can guarantee that the power won't go out in South Australia. This is why we, on this side, have a highly responsible and careful energy policy that will make sure we bring down prices for hardworking South Australians, for families and for businesses. We will be doing everything we can to guarantee the reliability of the system as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  It is like groundhog day to be back here in the chamber speaking on a bill that again attacks the most vulnerable in our community. I have only been in this parliament a short timeâ€”hopefully, I will be here a lot longerâ€”but I can say that, day after day, the government seem to bring into this place legislation that attacks women, pensioners, carers and students. It seems to attack all those who have very limited ability to go out there and get a job because of some reasonâ€”whether it is that they have left school before grade 12; they are at home caring for a parent, particularly if they are a young carer; they have a disability and there are a number of barriers in their way; or they are a student in a regional community. The government seem to really not like them very much at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017, it is like the zombie measures of 2014 rearing their ugly heads again. I really like the comment from the member for Bruce earlier today when speaking on this bill that to kill a zombie you need to find its brain. This government has yet to find its brain. I wonder when the Australian public will find that brainâ€”maybe never. Maybe an election is needed for the Australian public to realise that they cannot have a government which continues to attack the people in our community who need our help the most. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will welcome the opportunity to speak on the second reading amendment to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Better Targeting Student Payments) Bill 2017 that will be moved by the member for Jagajaga. I know that people in this House hold the member for Jagajaga in high regard, particularly those on this side. She is a person who has been relentless in her pursuit of fairness. I use the word 'fairness' because I remember hearing the Prime Minister use the word 'fairness' like it was some epiphany to him: 'I can say this word 'fairness' to the Australian public because my 2017-18 budget is about fairness.' How can it be fair to cut payments that help people in our community actually be in a position to go out there and get work? This is what the bill does. Those on the other side just cannot seem to help themselves. They bring forward a bill that, in part, Labor could support; yet there is absolutely no way we could support most of the bill, because it is simply not fair. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just rank hypocrisy that people on the other side have been walking around this week wearing Carers Week badges and lining up to have their photo taken in front of Carers Week posters to say 'I support carers'. What I can say for the carers in my community is they would not be very supportive of this bill. I don't know what the members on the other side think when they talk to carers, particularly young carers who have had to sacrifice years or maybe even full-time education in the state system to look after a sick parent and might think, 'I've got some time; I might go out and study part-time, and there are some payments I can get from the government to help me do that.' But this bill cuts those payments. It is absolutely shameful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about those payments, because there is a young person in my community that I know very, very well who is a young carer. He has been trying very hard to better his education because when he was at school he had to sacrifice so much time to look after his mother. His name is Jaeyden. Jaeyden has just turned 18 and he is a full-time carer for his mother. Earlier this year he visited this parliament with other young carers, as part of a delegation of young carers from across Australia, to raise awareness of the struggles they face. They met with the minister. I was in the room, and the minister seemed quite engaged with what these young carers were saying about the support they need to be in a position to access education and to be able to afford to do that. But it seems that was paying lip service to the situation of Jaeyden and other carers, if this legislation is any indication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have known Jaeyden since early last year and I would like to share with the House his story, as published in our local newspaper almost 12 months ago. He is one of an estimated 73,800 carers in Tasmania. That's a huge number for a small state like Tasmania. Jaeyden looks after his mother, who has been diagnosed with a heart condition. The article says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jaeyden takes his mother to her appointments, cooks and cleans. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Besides having the responsibility for looking after his mum's medication, Jaeyden also manages his family's finances and cares for his siblings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And he's been doing this for a long time. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He's been his mother's primary carer for three years and has helped manage her chronic condition since he was 10 years old.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It wasn't until he was 13 people recognised the role he'd taken on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a tough job that is deserving of a reward, not a punishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jaeyden, is not unlike many other carers in our community who are on call 24-hours a day, and the effects on their lives is real and worthy of more than just negativity from the Turnbull Government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what is in this bill in relation to someone like Jaeyden who may decide to study part-timeâ€”and I know he has. This bill reinforces the point made by the shadow minister and other speakers on this side that this legislation is about cutting payments to people that really need themâ€”those people whose study load is 76 per cent or less. A person whose study load is between 51 per cent and 75 per cent has their payment cut by $52 in the case of an education entry supplement recipient. A similar pensioner education supplement recipient has their payment cut by $15.60. That may not seem like a lot of money to those on the other side, but if you speak to these people it is a huge amount. It is the difference between making ends meet and not making ends meet in those households. A person whose study load is between 26 and 50 per cent has their payment cut by $104 in the case of an education entry supplement recipient. A similar pensioner education supplement recipient has their payment cut by $31.20. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that for the member for Wentworth and many on the other side these aren't huge sums of money, but for people like Jaeyden it is a lot. It goes to demonstrate how out of touch those on the other side areâ€”or they just don't care. The most vulnerable, the group this government constantly targets, the group famously described by the former Treasurer as 'leaners', are again being attacked. Yet, if they really want to get ahead and undertake study, they are punished. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jaeyden has completed three community service diplomas but has had to stop doing this because of his caring responsibilities. Clearly, he is unable to study full-time. This is a concept I think those opposite don't quite graspâ€”that these people really are not in a position to study full-time. It doesn't seem to matter to those opposite. But, if someone like Jaeyden wants to return to study, why should he be punished? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another aspect of this bill that I think those opposite really don't understand either. It's the continual attack on womenâ€”</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a local legend and a national legend. James Walker was known as the 'Mayor of Hackett' for his activism in the Hackett Community Association. Born in Ashfield in Sydney, and raised in Cowra, James was a serious transport buff, somebody who worked as the historical officer with the Department of Transport and for the Civil Aviation Authority, who compiled a number of booklets detailing a history of civil aviation in Australiaâ€”including <span style="font-style:italic;">The girls were up there too</span>, on the role of women in Australian aviation historyâ€”and who became a member of the Australian Railway Historical Society. He married Barbara Yelds in 1963, and their son, Jamie, was born shortly thereafter. James came to Hackett soon after arriving in Canberra and was a founding member of the Hackett Community Association in 2003, serving as its chair for many years. When the Neighbourhood Watch newsletter came out, James could be relied upon to drop into my office to ensure that I had a copy of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was fondly remembered at a get-together at Siam Twist recently, alongside so many of those who've contributed to the Hackett Community Association, among them Len Crossfield, Jochen Zeil, Terry de Luca, Bruce Smith, Dorothy Mackenzie, Jolanta Gallagher, Greg Haughy and Chris Mobbs. We remembered how James was initially appointed the historical officer for the association and proposed the idea of having an annual Hackett Day, which would later turn into Party at the Shops. James came every day to Siam Twist to get his cup of tea made with real tea leaves, not tea bags. He loved his books. He had a huge collection of over 8,000 books, including books on railway history, war history and the classics. As his son, Jamie, recalled, his pleasure was lending his books to his friends. Vale James Walker. My sympathies to his family for their loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the US national anthem, refusing to stand, in protest against police shootings of unarmed African Americans. His action, kneeling during the national anthem, has since been copied by players across US sports, including NFL, soccer, basketball, baseball and ice hockey. Importantly, their white teammates have supported them, locking arms in solidarity for the cause of racial equality, recognising that, while discrimination principally affects African Americans, the cause of racial equality is one in which whites have a critical role to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many, including South African journo Khaya Dlanga, have noted, events 49 years ago this week have an important lesson for these protests. In the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games, Australian athlete Peter Norman ran a time of 20.06 seconds in the men's 200 metres final. He won the silver medal, set the Australian record, and, as recently as the 2000 Olympics, that time would've won him the gold medal. But it was Norman's actions after the race which were so critical. As <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Star-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Spangled Banner</span> played, and Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood, heads bowed, with black gloves on their hands, it was Peter Norman who said to them, 'I'll stand with you.' Carlos said he expected to see fear in Norman's eyes, but he didn't: 'I only saw love.' Norman wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge, which he'd borrowed from white US rower Paul Hoffman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased in this place in 2012 to move a motion which received unanimous support from the parliament, apologising to Peter Norman for the way in which he was treated upon his return. He took a brave stand for racial equality. A statue at San Jose State University, erected in 2005, speaks so powerfully of what he did. It contains a space on the statue where Peter Norman stood and invites passers-by to stand in that place and consider what they would have done. It is an important message that resonates with Americans today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been talk recently of erecting a statue in Melbourne in tribute to Peter Norman. I believe that would be a powerful signal to recognise the role that Peter Norman played for racial equality, an action which would resonate to the other side of the world today and recognise that all of us can play a role in standing up for racial equality in the current era.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Sometimes you know when you've come into the right place and it's your place in timeâ€”when all your little ducks line up, if you like. And so it is with the National Energy Guarantee. I've been in this place since the 2007 election. It would be fair to say that over that time there has been a bit of repartee and a few objections between the two sides of parliament on how best to address the need for nations of the world to reduce CO2 but also keep the lights on and keep the electricity system working. We've had a number of schemes, including the carbon tax, which proved to be a fair bit of a lemon. We've had the Renewable Energy Target, which was initially instigated under the Howard government but ramped up rapidly and markedly under the Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That Renewable Energy Target has had a huge effect on investment in renewable energy around Australia. Prima facie, that's a good thing. In South Australia, in fact, 50 per cent of our energy comes from renewable energy and you would think that also is a good thing. But as early as 2012 I was talking to Alinta about the state and the future of the Northern Power Station at Port Augusta. The issue became painfully obvious to me and to them because, after investing around $170 million, they were losing a million dollars a month. The problem was that, as the amount of renewable energy rose, the number of days that Alinta could sell electricity into the market at a profit was reducing, to the point where there were about 50 to 70 days a year where they could actually sell electricity at a profit. It was obvious they had to close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day they closed, wholesale electricity prices in South Australia virtually doubled overnightâ€”just like that. We were running at around $60 a megawatt hour and we went up to $120 a megawatt hour. What an astonishing thing it was. It just showed how much we needed storage and how much we needed baseload electricity in our system. In the ramp-up to that period, Alinta went to the South Australian government. We know this because a letter was leaked sometime later. They said, 'We will keep this power station open for anything up to 15 years'â€”because they had 15 years of life left in themâ€”'for $8 million a year.' The South Australian government said no. They said no and now they are spending over $550 million applying bandaids to the disastrous situation we have in South Australia now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All that is behind us. It is what it is. The South Australian government was solely responsible for that spectacular act of blowing up a good power station. We've since had the Finkel review. The Finkel review made some really interesting recommendations. One was that in some regions we need to make sure that new renewable energy is accompanied by storage. So it is in South Australia. The report that's been brought down by the expert committee, led by Alan Finkel, has recommended a reliability guarantee, which means baseload electricity. We need some baseload electricity. That will be the case in South Australia. We need an emissions guarantee. Under the emissions guarantee in South Australia, we probably won't build a lot of new renewable energy generators. But there is absolutely nothing to stop people building up reliable energy with renewable energy, and they will do so. We will do so in Port Augusta with a solar thermal tower, because that will be baseload electricity. There is every opportunity to turn renewable electricity into baseload electricity. But what renewable energy does have to do now under these recommendations is compete against every other form of electricity, because we know we've already met that renewable target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this policy is on the right track. I am excited by this policy. I know it's going to solve the climate wars in Australia. But we do need some partners. We need bipartisan support, because one of the things that's been holding up electricity in Australia for the last 10 years is lack of certainty in the investment cycle. We need the two sides of politics to come together behind the recommendations of the expert panel and give that certainty to industry so it can get on with the job. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  The Australian Bureau of Statistics has once again confirmed suicide as a leading cause of death for Australians aged 15 to 44. Last year there was an average of eight deaths by suicide every day in Australia, and in Western Australia there were 371 deaths by suicide in 2016. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are approximately twice as likely to die by suicide as non-Indigenous Australians, with those in the 15- to 17-year-old age group having a suicide rate more than five times higher than their non-Indigenous peers. Veterans of our defence forces are also vulnerable, with research showing that young ex-servicemen aged between 18 and 24 are twice as likely to die by suicide as men of the same age range in the general population. This is very relevant in Brand, as we are home to a high number of service personnel and veterans across the communities of Rockingham and Kwinana. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These figures are horrifying and show the need to have strategies to deal with this devastating reality. One death by suicide is too many. Work needs to be done on preventing these tragediesâ€”on helping people who feel they have no other option than to take their own life. We must get on with the job of ensuring that healthcare professionals in this area are supported properly so they are best able to deal with this devastating reality. We need to work with the community on ways to turn these figures around. Inaction on suicide prevention leads to loss of life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy of establishing suicide prevention trial sites across Australia supports the National Mental Health Commission's recommendation of the nationwide introduction of a whole-of-community approach to suicide prevention. The government has adopted Labor's policy of implementing suicide prevention projects around the country, and this is a positive step for the community. One of these, the Perth South suicide prevention trial site, is in my electorate of Brand. However, there have been delays rolling out the project in Rockingham and Kwinana, with little information available to the community about when it can expect the trial to get underway. There is also very little information about what the trial will mean for the local area and how it will expand services or introduce new ones. We simply don't know. At the moment, sadly, it looks like this initiative is made up of only a government media release, but I am an optimist and I am convinced the community itself will drive this important suicide prevention project in the absence of government leadership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm hopeful that once this project is up and running it will make a difference to my community. There are many dedicated and hardworking mental health service providers in the Perth South region, and I was fortunate enough to meet with some of them recently. With the shadow assistant minister for mental health, Senator Deborah O'Neill, I heard from these engaged community workers at a meeting we held in my electorate. We met with representatives from headspace, South Coastal Women's Health Service, the NDIS, Ruah Community Services, Relationships Australia and Community First. Each and every one of the stakeholders attending gave a different perspective on the realities they face as they work with people in distress. What became apparent from hearing people speak was the need for the Perth South suicide prevention program to get up and running as soon as possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health is no longer the absolute taboo subject it once was. We're getting better at talking about it. We now ask each other, 'Are you okay?' and we let our young people know that headspace is a dedicated youth mental health service there to support them. But, sadly, it is still not enough and suicide continues to affect far too many people in our communities. Of great concern is the impact suicide has on a person's loved ones, as they have to deal with the tragic and unexpectedâ€”and what might have been preventableâ€”death. Families, friends and workmates have to come to terms with the loss, with the trauma and with their grief. They too need the support of mental health workers who do so much with the resources they are given. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By investing in suicide prevention programs we are taking a strategic course of action that mitigates the need for other support services, and this is a good plan. The government has committed to 12 suicide prevention trial sites to be rolled out. Three are in WA. Each site will receive $3 million for better resources. But allocating money is of no use if projects are not being delivered properly. I'm hopeful that the delays that are holding up the implementation of these projects at their trial sites in the community will be dealt with so that work can begin as soon as possible to assist those people in need. And to the community groups I met recently in my office in Kent Street in Rockingham, I say, thank you for your dedicated commitment to our community and to the young people in distress who are thinking of suicide. I want to let you know that I'll be there to help you get this suicide prevention trial site off the ground.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  The centenary of the First World War armistice is just over a year away. At that time we as Australians will pause and reflect on the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World Warâ€”the war that apparently would end all wars. It's interesting, as we come to the middle of October, that the first part of the First World War that would seek to finish in the Middle East would start with the Australian 4th Light Horse brigade charging at Beersheba on 31 October 1917 and would lead the way for the Balfour Declaration of 2 November, providing Israel access to their holy land, which has always been their land, that would lead to General Allenby taking the city of Jerusalem on 11 December 1917 and the liberation of the Middle East.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We would see another great Australian general, John Monash, leading forces at the Battle of Amiens, with our Canadian and British friends, starting on 8 August 1918, that began the 100 days until the end of the war on the Western Front. Australia has and always will pull our weight in the conflagration of war across the world, and it's important that we pause and reflect on what Australia has done. As for most Australians, it's an issue close to my heart, and many of us here are descendants of someone who participated or witnessed a significant moment in our national history, many of them on the battlefield. It is important that we remember and honour the heavy sacrifice our young country made in the First World War. That a nation of less than five million could have something like 10 per cent of our nation's eligible sons die in battle and 20 per cent more wounded is simply staggering. I've had the honour of serving these people, as have many of my colleagues here, not only in the House of Representatives but also in uniform. The service and sacrifice is something that resonates strongly within our national consciousness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, the Centenary of Anzac 2014-18 has been one of the most important commemorative periods in our national collective history. This Anzac centenary program commenced in 2014 with the Albany Convoy Commemorative Event, marking the 100th anniversary of the departure of the first convoy of ships to take Australia's bravest sons, and some daughters, to the First World War. Earlier this year the minister announced that the Australian government had committed additional funding to support the 100th anniversary of the First World War armistice. This program will conclude with commemorations marking that 100th anniversary on Remembrance Day, 11 November 2018. A key part of this program is the establishment of a community consultative committee in each electorate to look at how we can appropriately remember that event. The role of these committees will be to assist local MPs to seek the community's view on the best way of doing this commemoration. So I'll be encouraging members of my local electorate to reach out to my office and to have their say, to assist me in reviewing all the proposals that come before applications are submitted to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for their review. This Armistice Centenary Grants Program that has been announced by the minister is $50,000 for each electorate to ensure that the memory of those who gave everything for our values and our freedoms will not be forgotten. This Armistice Centenary Grants Program will allow the community to mark the armistice in a pertinent and real way by establishing a memorial of sorts, within a somewhat wide definition, to remember these enormous events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I encourage all organisations and all community groups on the northern Gold Coast who feel they'd like to help or commemorate this important event in some way, to get in touch with my office. We'll provide you with the guidance and the application forms. A consultative committee has also been set up in my electorate to ensure consistency. It's the same consultative committee we are using for the Stronger Communities Grants. I encourage you to get hold of the application paperworkâ€”it will be on the Department of Veteran's Affairs website as wellâ€”and put in an application to commemorate and remember these historic events that mark the end of the war toâ€”supposedlyâ€”end all wars.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I rise today to speak on a matter that is putting many of our communities at risk, isolating individuals and weakening our small businessesâ€”the government's flawed copper NBN. I've received many complaints from residents in my electorate of Hindmarsh who are absolutely sick and tired of the unreliable communication services that they're receiving. They are residents from Lockleys and other suburbs in my electorateâ€”West Lakes, Flinders Park and Mile End. Most recently I've had complaints from a group of residents in the Netley area. Our residents are experiencing installation problems, high drop-out rates and slow speeds. It's no surprise that complaints are flooding in from consumers who are dissatisfied with this government's patchy copper based fibre to the node plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently I've been contacted by a local group in my electorate, the Netley Residents Association. They're a great group who have been around for well over 10 years and are very active on local issues. I understand that members of this group are concerned. They're concerned constituents who have experienced a data rate that swings between 25 megabits per second and five megabits per second, with complete outages ranging from a few minutes to over 19 hours in some cases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only this afternoon I was speaking to Fred, one of the constituents from Netley, who was telling me all about it. This is not acceptable. If you're running a business or you're a university student and you have to download assignments through the net, it is not acceptable. Fred was telling me that their access to the NBN relies on a copper Foxtel cable that runs past their home and has done so for over 20 yearsâ€”copper cables two decades old. When the cable was installed the internet was just getting started. As more people from the street connect through this outdated technology, the swing in data rates and drop-outs is getting worse. How many more complaints need to be raised before we see action on this matter? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday it was reported that in the past financial year we have seen complaints rise by nearly 160 per cent. What have the coalition government done to address this? I see nothing. I receive concerns from residents on this matter on a daily basis, as do a lot of MPs. The range of ways that residents have been impacted is utterly concerning. I'll go through some of them and what I've heard. For example, there are parents whose children are unable to study from home and risk falling behind, because a lot of the assignments are done on the net. They have to do their research on the net et cetera. Local organisations aren't able to strengthen their ties with the community through advancing technology. One of the most shocking things is that there are local businesses that are losing clientele because they're not accessible through communications. Their EFTPOS machines are down. This has a very detrimental effect on small business. You can just imagine people coming in to buy a product that you're selling and wanting to pay on EFTPOS, and you say, 'Sorry, I can't do it, do you have cash?' Theyâ€™ll leave and go somewhere else. There are residents who have serious medical conditions. There's a real concern that they have no means of reaching out for assistance should an emergency arise. These people have the anxiety of not knowing whether someone will come to their aid when a medical alert button is pressed. And, as I mentioned earlier, there are tertiary students who can't submit their assignments on time. The list could go on and on, but they're just a few of the complaints that I've heard. To top all of that off, we're paying top dollar for this inferior network. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I ask the coalition government again: when will it start listening to the concerns raised by consumers about this flawed scheme? What could have been a nation-building moment for the country, as envisaged by the former Labor government, through a fibre-to-the-premises model, a future-proof nation-building moment, has been missed. We've got technology that's copper, that's running in a 20-year-old Foxtel cable.  While the Turnbull government sits on its hands, Labor is here and proactive and committed to promoting innovation and technology. Only a Labor government will support our constituents by supporting a world-class, reliable internet infrastructure for all Australians. It's not too much to ask to receive services that were promised and consumers are signing up for. We all remember the Prime Minister's pre-election promises in 2013 about how fantastic this model for the NBN, which was different to Labor's, was going to be. We warned him then and told him it wouldn't work and that there would be problems with it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  October the 11th was the International Day of the Girl Child, and many in this House spoke of attending special events to make sure we know that girls and women are a significant part of our society. What the heck is wrong with us? We are 'woman'â€”the one who gives life to every individual on this planet, the one who endures extreme pain during childbirth and the one who's most often seen as a second-class citizen. Acknowledging the International Day of the Girl Child is acknowledging that we and societies around the world don't treat women as the sustaining part of community or society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, as Chair of the Australian Parliamentary Group on Population and Development, I attended the general assembly of an internationally aligned group called the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development. I'd like to note the hard work of Dr Mika Marumoto, the Executive Director of the AFPPD, and the Hon. Professor Keizo Takemi, the Chair of the AFPPD, who, unfortunately, due to the dissolving of the Japanese parliament, was unable to attend the assembly. As a consequence, I was lucky enough to be invited to do that job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 30 nations at this forum, from Central Asia, South-East Asia, Asia and the Pacific, with elected men and women from our region and beyond determined to make a difference as a priority on matters relating to women's empowerment, education, economic independence and a reduction of gender based violence. In addition, there is the need to pay attention to our youth, with some nations having in excess of 50 per cent youth unemployment. Finally, in nations with settled economies and lengthy periods of peace, there is the issue of caring for the ageing population. Each and every one of these matters has both a direct and an indirect effect on the life of the girl child, whether in her early life or in her years of wisdom. We should be celebrating all our people every day and not just pick one sector, like girls, pay lip service to them and do nothing else. As a society, here in Australia and internationally, we are of one mind in the pursuit of gender equity, women's empowerment, and women's safety and health. These issues are priorities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a local level there are groups like the CWA and the Smith Family, and some individuals, like Nikki Morris, an ambassador for <span style="font-style:italic;">Embrace</span>, who ran an Empower Me camp. They all recognise that girls and their confidence begin to be lost between the ages of 10 and 12. These groups are assisting with scholarships and workshops to rebuild that confidence so that girls canâ€”and can be encouraged to think that they shouldâ€”take on half the world. After all, we make up 51 per cent. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a global level we see actions like the 'gag rule', withdrawing essential funding for programs that have been instrumental in changing women's lives for the better. This change to funding will push so many programs backwards. We must collectively work and advocate wherever possible to have funding for these programs restored. They have led to educational emancipation and addressed issues related to health. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me share a disturbing image from Arthur Erken of the UNFPA. We still have an international maternal death rate equal to two jumbo jets crashing to earthâ€”that's 800 womenâ€”every day. It is of great significance that many countries have introduced a minimum marriage age, laws to protect families and laws to support victims of family violence. There's an overarching responsibility to develop projects that are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. This is indeed an international responsibility. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the recognition of women's participation in policymaking, politics and peace-making negotiations is an inspiration for all of us to take on and apply to the best of our ability and position. We must empower our girls and women through education, being good role models, training, political mentorship and encouragement. As an essential part of this, women's health rights need to be promoted and respected. It is part of her personal recognition of her potential to fill a role as an economic source, an anchor for her family and a leader in her community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having met MPs from PNG who got knocked out at the last election, aspiring candidates in the Solomon Islands and young girls who were youth parliamentarians, I've set myself two personal targets to promote women and girls in Gilmore. I'll have a Girls in Leadership weekend to discuss skills needed and barriers to be wary of, to listen to inspiration from present and past members of different levels of government, and to build confidence. I'll invite young adults from my region, on a fifty-fifty male-female basis, to help establish a Gilmore Youth Parliament to enable them to have a voice they currently don't have. They are frustrated that their views on politics, education and other local issues cannot be heard. It's absolutely time to do more for our girls.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Today, I want to talk about a great opportunity for seniors, people living with disability, providers and carers to come together in the electorate of Blair. The Blair Disability Links is an annual event that brings together organisations and groups that provide services, support and opportunities for those living with a disability, their carers, families and seniors in the Ipswich and Somerset region. The launch of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Disability Links</span> directory coincides with the International Day of People with Disability, which is 3 December. It celebrates the contributions and achievements of people with disability in our community. Since 2010, the Blair Disability Links has grown every year and demonstrates the need for disability service providers, people living with disability and their carers to connect and share information throughout our local community. I wish to acknowledge and thank the service providers, carers and volunteers who work so hard to improve and enhance the lives of people living with disability and seniors in the Ipswich and Somerset region. They do tireless and often thankless work but provide enormous support and wonderful opportunities for people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an absolute pleasure to hold the Blair Disability Links each year and it is probably the best thing I've done since I've been a federal member. I'm grateful for the immense contribution that people have made. Every year, we give out the <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Disability Links</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Seniors Links</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> and we've given out nearly 80,000 of those directories. I look forward to 1 December and the great celebration of ability and diversity that will take place at the Brassall shopping centre in Ipswich from 10 am to 2 pm. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Seniors Link</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span> booklet is nearly 50 pages in length and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Disability Links </span>booklet nearly 100 pages in length. I expect them to increase by at least 20 pages as more organisations become involved in the directory. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I must detail some problems some of my constituents have brought to me regarding their experiences with the NDIS application process. My office has received complaints ranging from telephone-only assessment interviews; excessive time frames and processing; assessment practices for eligible conditions, including refusals of long-term conditions; disregarding reports from treating medical professionals; insufficient funding within plans; impractical restrictions on how funds can be spent; and, in some cases, constituents have reported themselves short on funds due to provider fees increasing following allocation of funding. The common complaints seem to be, while bringing the potential for flexibility, the current NDIS procedures and practices, particularly around assessment, result in considerable difficulty and distress for constituents. I have requested a meeting with the NDIA in my electorate. I look forward to meeting with Carers Queensland, who have the contract locally. I look forward to the government finally getting the NDIS right.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0J" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEENAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I rise today to inform the House of a little known but devastating chronic illness known as mitochondrial disease. During Mitochondrial Disease Awareness Week in September, I was provided the opportunity to meet with my local constituents Don and Rely Beard and their 39-year-old daughter Pippa, who was diagnosed with the disease as a teenager. Mito, as it is commonly called, is a genetic disease that robs the body's cells of energy. It can be present at birth or develop later in life, causing physical, developmental and cognitive disabilities, sometimes even death. During our meeting, the Beard family discussed the need for greater awareness and research into the disease, which is why I'm here today to share their story. I undertook that I would raise it in parliament when I met with them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At age 19, Pippa Beard was a happy and healthy teenager. She was attending university, had a few part-time jobs and socialised regularly with friends. One morning she woke up in a panic not being able to see. Her concerned parents rushed her to the emergency room and for the next few months doctors struggled to work out what was wrong. Pippa's blindness was thankfully only temporary, but she had to quit university studies and her part-time job, as she started to suffer from seizures and a loss of motor control on a weekly basis. It took doctors some 18 months to diagnose Pippaâ€”mostly due to the lack of information about the genetic disorder at the timeâ€”with a type of mitochondrial disease known as MELAS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficulty with a mito disease is that it has no definitive symptoms. It mimics so many other different illnesses at the one time that diagnosing the disease is extremely difficult. So, for the past 20 years, Don and Rely Beard have had to watch their daughter's healthy body shut down as a result of repeated seizures, balance difficulties and muscle weakness. Don and Rely are full-time carers for Pippa, but, as the disease is unpredictable, every day can be different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since she was diagnosed, the Beard family have been working together with the Australian Mitochondrial Disease Foundation to raise awareness, seek out treatment options and prevent it being passed on through future generations. Mito is not a disease that is widely known in Australia, yet one in 200 Australians carry the genetic mutation that could potentially lead to the disease developing. Family members can appear well and healthy but are unknowingly carrying the genetic defect, which can be passed on to their children and which, in most cases, is present through their mother's side. Unfortunately, there is no known treatment or cure for mitochondrial disease. However, research from the United Kingdom has found that it may be possible, through the use of IVF based procedures, to reduce the risk of the disease being passed on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still a lot to be covered about the disease, but the most important thing, and what the foundation exists to do, is to raise awareness of it. I therefore encourage all of my colleagues to go to the Australian Mitochondrial Disease Foundation website to get further information about the disease. I thank the Beard family for coming to see me to raise my awareness of it. I am pleased to raise it here today.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  As I'm sure all who work in this building know, we regularly have visitors from primary schools across Australia coming here to Canberra to visit this place and to see our wonderful democracy at work. Over the course of this week I've had the pleasure of having a chat and brief tour with some 220 students visiting from three schools from my electorate of Ballarat, in addition to the Parliamentary Education Office, their hospitality, as well as other parts of their official program. These students were from Bacchus Marsh, Mount Pleasant and Darley primary schools. Like each school group that comes here, they were impeccably behaved, I can assure their parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These school visits to Canberra are a wonderful opportunity for all of these kids. It gives them firsthand experience of some of the most central sites of our national life, whether it be here at Parliament House, the War Memorial, the National Gallery or Questacon. It's often the first experience these kids have with Canberra, and it teaches them about how our system of government works, how laws are made and about our history. Beyond being an enlightening experience for the schoolkids, I also find that these visits are a valuable experience for me as a parliamentarian. Personally, I always relish the opportunity to meet with these children when they come up here to Canberra. It reminds me of home. It reminds me that, while over time we may grow to see this place as our workplace, it is far more than that. It is architecturally stunning, it has beautiful gardens and artworks wherever you look, and we who work here have both the honour and the responsibility of making decisions that affect all people across Australia. Meeting with these kids and even just seeing them as they walk around the building should remind each of us that this is, of course, the people's house and that it belongs to these children just as much as it belongs to the rest of us who work here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to acknowledge the fantastic work that the Parliamentary Education Office do in taking children through an education experience and the fantastic resources they have on their website. I had cause to ring the PEO this week because I know one of my schools has a kid with ASD coming up soon and I wanted to get some visual aids to give to his mum to help her prepare him to lower his anxiety when he comes here. Within an hour, they made a whole raft of information available to me. I also want to thank the press gallery. We often take our school groups through there. In particular, the staff of Channel Nine and Channel Ten have taken kids into the green room and filmed them. Again, it really makes the interaction between the press, the government and the parliament and what kids are seeing and experiencing all the more special. I know they're very busy, but it's very generous of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing these kids on their visits should remind us that the decisions we make here affect every one of these children just as much as they affect everyone across the country. I hope the kids enjoyed their visit this week. It was a pleasure to host them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  Earlier this month I was able to host the Minister for Small Business, Michael McCormack, in my electorate of Murray. We had a range of forums where he was able to talk to many of the small businesses in my region. Small business is often referred to as the engine room of the economy and this is the absolute truth when it comes to the electorate of Murray. Murray has over 18,000 small and medium sized businesses and, whilst we didn't get the chance to talk to every one of them, we certainly did our best. We started in Echuca. We had a forum for breakfast in Echuca with small-business owners, from real estate agents to newsagency owners. We had people from every sector within Echuca. There was great service from the cafe owner, David Bowman, who looked after us and hosted that breakfast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then travelled to Shepparton, where small-business owners were willing to stop and have a chat with the minister as we walked down Fryers Street. We started with Safety Services, which is a business that sells safety clothing for construction sites around the Goulburn Valley. Young business owners are fully involved in all of the issues to do with small business and are certainly looking for assistance with things such as a lower tax rate for business and the instant asset write-off. As we continued our way down Fryers Street, we went into one of our newer cafes, Jetjas, owned by Jackie Walker and her partner. Jetjas is a derivative of the Yorta Yorta language. Jackie makes a whole range of Indigenous food, as well as everyday cafe food. They are very enthusiastic and are pushing hard. It is a real goer in the city of Shepparton. Also in the same stretch is Friars Cafe with Bec Dennis and her partner. They reinforced how important it is for businesses to have the instant asset write-off. We went to the Goulburn Murray Credit Union and spoke to their business people about some of the challenges that they're having. We had a forum at the council. We had a forum with the Committee for Greater Shepparton, with Michael McCormack again talking to businesses about what we are doing as a government to assist them. In the evening we had dinner, again with more businesses, and they had the opportunity to come and talk to Michael McCormack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The businesses in the electorate of Murray, like businesses everywhere, want access to the government and access to ministers. They want to get their issues out in relation to energy, the labour workforce and what more we can do to support businesses and their investments.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  In 2004, I first spoke in the parliament about an incredibly brave young boy named Sammy-Joe Liistro and the life he endures with the rare genetic disorder, trichothiodystrophy, or TTD. I met Sammy-Joe and his mum, Maria, when she came to me for help all those years ago. Sammy-Joe is now 28 years old and, thanks to the unwavering love and dedication of his mum, his supportive family, friends and the community, and the fantastic care of our medical profession, he has exceeded all expectations. At 28, Sammy-Joe is the oldest living TTD sufferer in Australiaâ€”a phenomenal outcome but one that comes with a new set of challenges for Sammy-Joe and his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not much is known about TTD in Australia, let alone treatment for adults. Sammy-Joe has been receiving critical intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, IVIG, which effectively checks his bone density. It's a treatment that is required every three years and is administered over six months. Although Sammy-Joe has received amazing support and care from the Austin Hospital, unfortunately they cannot provide IVIG treatment, which is critical to treating the symptoms of Sammy-Joe's disease. The blood bank has set criteria that Sammy-Joe, as an adult, doesn't fit and therefore he doesn't qualify. The only way to get IVIG treatment is to pay for it or travel overseas. This is no longer a viable option for the Liistro family. Unlike the United States, where Sammy-Joe has received treatment, there is not enough research available in Australia to link the treatment of IVIG and TTD in adultsâ€”research that would enable criteria to be set that would allow Sammy-Joe access to the treatment. With the exception of Sammy-Joe Liistro, no TTD sufferer has survived to adulthood, so it's not prioritised and it's all a bit too hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Maria Liistro and her son Sammy-Joe ask is that the government puts this treatment on the list of chronic diseases for young adults, as without it Sammy-Joe will suffer insurmountably and so will his family. Sammy-Joe's life is an inspiration. In raising awareness of this rare genetic disorder, I want to call on the governmentâ€”in fact, call on all of usâ€”to do a little bit more in treating TTD as it develops into adulthood. I want to end with some words from Maria Liistro. She is a great inspiration. She says:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Sammy-Joe is my pride and joy, my heart and soul, and my whole reason for living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He is truly a miracle child and a survivor, an inspiration to his family and friends.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Like all parents, we want everything for our son, and thinking ahead about what the future may, or may not hold, makes me strengthen my determination to see that my child has every opportunity and experience he deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In raising awareness of this very important and rare condition and this wonderful family, the Liistro family, I ask that we pay some attention to assisting Sammy-Joe and his family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I rise today to congratulate Richard Thaler, of the Chicago School of Economics, for being awarded this year's Nobel Prize for his contribution to the relatively new field of behavioural economics. It would be somewhat negligent to not mention Gary Becker, also a professor of the Chicago School, who first started extending microeconomic analysis to all human behaviour, including such arcane topics as why someone gets married or why someone commits crime. I hasten to add that Professor Becker found no correlation between these two; it's just that they were the fields of study that he decided to undertake.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this field of economics can sometime seem a little removed from everyday life, its applications are critical to government policymakingâ€”because, above all else, we are surprisingly perverse creatures, making highly irrational and often damaging decisions. Not that this was Becker's conclusion of his analysis of why people get married; quite the contrary. Becker concluded that people got married for distinctly rational reasonsâ€”well, mostly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an example, recently, as a member of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, ASIC concluded that the consumer reforms of the 1990s, undertaken through the CLERP initiative, were in fact a failure, because, by forcing financial providers to produce thick product disclosure statements, with glossy photographs, we the parliament inadvertently sent a signal to consumers that financial products that were not suitable probably were. Consumers concluded, 'Look at how thick the material is. The quality of the paper is so good, it must be a good financial product.' Sometimes those products were not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Richard Thaler and the behavioural science concepts that he introduced into economics have their foundation in the work Becker did, but they are more practical in their applications and they are almost certainly the most critical thing that has happened to policymakers and parliaments in the last half century. The insight that people use heuristics to make complex decisions is critical to the work that we do in this parliamentâ€”that, often by making things more complex, we hurt the very people we are trying to protect; that regulations and laws often meant to help consumers, end up doing the opposite. Finally, but most importantly, Richard Thaler brought to our attention how small nudges, like where the salad is at a school canteen, can drastically improve nutrition, or how and where organ donation options are presented have made immense changes to how many people opt to donate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  Australia is a country that makes things. We have a long and proud history of manufacturing. We have always had a sense of pride when buying 'Australian made' because we are supporting Australian jobs. Over the last 20 years we have been losing that sense of pride, and that is because our manufacturing industry has been on the decline. Over the past 20 years, manufacturing employment has almost halved, slipping from 14.2 per cent of the workforce to just 8.2 per cent. In net terms, since 1994, employment in the sector has fallen from 1.1 million to approximately 950,000 workers, or a decline of around 15 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, even during periods of decline, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the Australian manufacturing sector has continued to represent a core source of economic prosperity for Australia. It has outperformed many other sectors in terms of sector contribution to Australia's sustained economic performance and our capacity to generate quality jobs. In manufacturing, well over 80 per cent of the jobs are full time, the majority of which have the full suite of employee benefits, including paid leave. There has been a relatively low propensity to turn manufacturing jobs into less secure jobs through casualisation or the use of independent contractors. We all know that manufacturing jobs are good jobs, and for those very reasons. However, in recent years Australia has taken its eye off the ball regarding one of the greatest economic drivers and relied too heavily on the mining boom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturing is a key pillar of economic growth in our country. We only need to look abroad to prove this very point. The world's best-performing economies tend to have innovative and sophisticated manufacturing sectors. The advanced economies that recovered very strongly from the global financial crisisâ€”Germany, Sweden and Switzerlandâ€”also have the most competitive manufacturing sectors. The German government invests in research and applied science for the manufacturing industry through the government-funded Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, and Switzerland beat China in manufacturing innovation on the Bloomberg Innovation Index. How was this done? It was done through government investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is at a tipping point. We have high unemployment and stagnant wage growth. The mining boom has slowed and productivity is on the decline. The way out of sectoral stagnation, unemployment and environmental degradation is through productivity-enhancing investment in innovation and skills. For some reason the Turnbull government is reducing its contribution to this vital strategic objective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Labor knows the investment and focus that is needed to get us back on track, and it is only Labor that will deliver a solid future for this nation. A Shorten Labor government will establish a new $1 billion Australian manufacturing future fund to drive innovation and help Australian manufacturers grow their businesses and create new jobs. Modelled on Labor's successful Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian manufacturing future fund will leverage financeâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  Australia is now into its 27th consecutive year of uninterrupted economic growth. There have been challenging times since the GFCâ€”no doubt about that. Yet the latest economic data points to growing signs of improvement for our economy and growing confidence. The most recent data shows that our economy grew 0.8 per cent in the June quarter of this year, and, according to a recent NAB survey, business conditions have risen to their highest levels in almost a decade. Business investment is rising. On the jobs front, there's been some really good news: the fastest creation of new jobs since before the GFC and about four out of five new jobs being full-time jobs. Regarding the federal government's budget, the most recent results show an improvement of $4.4 billion, compared to the forecast in the May budget, predominantly off the back of high company receipts and lower welfare bills as a consequence of more people obtaining the dignity they want and deserve through finding work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rising confidence, the economic growth, the extra taxes being paid as companies return to profitability, helping to improve the budget, the new jobs being created, the fewer people on welfareâ€”these are all results being driven, I believe, predominantly by Australia's small business sector. Why? Earlier this year the government lowered taxes for those small businessesâ€”for the entire small-business sector right across Australia, who we believe are the backbone of the economyâ€”and we extended the instant asset write-off to help small businesses bring forward some of their investments. When we outlined our plan to lower small-business taxes and it was opposed, we said that it should lead to more jobs and more investment. And now, since we've made those changes, the new jobs and the extra investment can be seen in the statistics and the economic results being released.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now this government has released the latest plank of our energy planâ€”the National Energy Guarantee. Just as we argued that reducing small-businesses taxes should lead to more jobs, now, on energy, we're saying this should reduce wholesale electricity costs. It comes after we've made energy retailers ensure that small businesses are getting the best possible deals on their energy bills, not just being on default rates, which could be more expensive. The Energy Security Board has advised that the guarantee will lower electricity prices, compared to doing nothing and compared to schemes that involve taxes or subsidies. Small businesses need affordable power, both electricity and gas, and small businesses need reliable power. Unreliable energy undermines jobs, investment and prosperity if it means that the lights go out, the computers and the tills go dead, the production lines stop and the stoves and the coffee machines go cold.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that's been getting on with the job of helping small business to build the opportunities and the prosperity that Australians need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I rise today to recognise two significant events in our modern, multicultural Australian community. Over the last week, Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities in Australia and around the world have been celebrating Diwali. On behalf of Labor, I extend my warmest wishes to everyone on this occasion. Diwali, or the Festival of Lights, is a celebration of the triumph of good over evil. The lighting of traditional earthen diyas or candles around the home symbolises the illumination of hope, wealth, peace and prosperity. Over four days, families and friends adorn their homes with colourful decorations, share sweet dishes and perfume their homes with incense in celebration of good health, knowledge and wealth as a triumph over darkness, ignorance and hate. Around Australia, lights have been shining brightly and skies have been filled with fireworksâ€”from Canberra to Parramatta, Martin Place and Adelaideâ€”over the past week. It is an important time to reflect on those less fortunate and to be grateful for the rich traditions our modern, multicultural society has come to represent. As the steady light of the diya shines across Australia and in homes this week, may it serve as a guiding compass for all of us towards the path of unity and be the beacon with which we as a nation continue to celebrate our success as a modern, multicultural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of Labor, I would also like to extend my best wishes to Baha'i communities in Australia and around the world as they mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah. Baha'u'llah, the prophet founder of the Baha'i faith, devoted his life to the service of God, spreading the message of peace and unity for all. Among his teachings was the recognition of earth as one country, with all humans as equal citizens, and to love the whole world as one would love their country. It is in the principles of equality and love that our modern, multicultural society thrives as a united nation of many backgrounds, cultures and faiths, and it is in celebration of our diverse communities that the Australian story is strengthened and enhanced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over two days in October, Baha'i communities here in Australia will come together with family and friends to celebrate the life of a devoted man whose commitment to God and humanity was unwavering in the face of persecution, imprisonment and exile. We are grateful for the contribution of the Baha'i community to our nation and we are privileged to be recognising such an important milestone for the Baha'i community. To everyone across Australia who is coming together to celebrate with family and friends, we wish you prosperity and joy for the year ahead.</span>

The petition has been through the appropriate process through the Petitions Committee and has been certified by that committee. The petition relates to matters involving telecommunications carriers and the erection of towers, which, as members, we're all very familiar with in dealing with those issues in our communities. I present this petition as the member for Cook, not in my other capacity as the Treasurer. As my constituents in Southern Sydney would know, the issues that are dear to them always remain dear to me. I'm happy to perform this duty on their behalf. I thereby table the petition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the issue of Telecommunications Carriers, having the flexibility (subject to community consultation) under the current Telecommunications' Act 1997, to install mobile phone base stations in pure residential locations on existing Telegraph or power poles, with no set specified distance of separation from residential homes. State Planning laws classify this as Exempt Development, Local Councils have no approval role here and the visual impact of residents, and the health and well-being interests of local communities are not respected by Carriers and are largely ignored.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to ensure that Telecommunications Carriers are not able to install mobile phone base stations on existing telegraph or power poles in residential areas, without Local Council approval. This can be achieved by Amending Schedule 3 and the Telecommunications (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination, of the Telecommunications Act (1997) - both of which will close this loophole.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  This amendment bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, was first flagged in last year's budget. It was the political centrepiece of the Turnbull government's 2016-17 budget. The fact that we've only got to commence the parliamentary debate concerning these bills in mid-September of 2017 speaks to the chasm that exists between what the Turnbull government says are its political priorities and what its deeds reveal its priorities to actually be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has made plain that we will not support the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut for business. It is a tax cut that the Australian budget and the country cannot afford. It is in ever-deepening deficit under this conservative government, with a gross debt that has hit the $500 billion mark in June and is still growing. It is a record debt that has nearly doubled from the $280 billion that existed when the coalition took office in 2013. It is a matter of fact that, when the coalition took office, gross debt per person was $12,076. Today, after nearly five years of coalition economic stewardship, that number has grown to around $20,025 per person. This is a government Australia cannot afford, and this government is proposing a tax cut that Australia cannot afford.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's plans for growth only meant growth of the debt. The government's budget papers expect gross debt to hit $725 billion in 2027-28, with no peak in sight. It is the coalition that turned out to be the debt and deficit disaster for our country. Labor has always opposed this tax cut because it represents a significant structural deterioration to the budget over the medium term and it represents a deterioration at precisely the wrong moment for the Australian public debt. This amendment bill represents a hit to the budget that shows the rank hypocrisy of a government which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair on the one hand and yet deliberately deepens the debt on the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember the glory days of 2013-14, when the then Prime Minister and the then Treasurer spoke of the nation's debt and deficit disaster? We don't hear that rhetoric these days. Why? Because the successive Abbott and Turnbull coalition governments have dramatically expanded Australia's national debt and have abandoned even the pretext of reining in public sector spending and gross debt. On this government's watch, the deficit has blown out and debt has crashed past the half a trillion dollar mark. The Turnbull government doesn't speak of debt and deficit anymore. Policy failure has rendered that catchphrase an embarrassment to the coalition. In 2016, the Prime Minister found a new catchphrase: jobs and growth. Like its predecessor, this phrase, too, is on its way to embarrassing oblivion in the annals of conservative marketing failures. Today, Australia's gross domestic product growth is less than two per cent. That is lower than the GDP growth of New Zealand, the United States and Canada. That is less than the OECD average. The very low growth rates experienced by Australia are a testament to the fact that, when this government focuses on a policy priority, one can be assured of failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also get a sense of the scale of the budget hit earlier this year when the farcical scenes of question time are recalled. Just after the last budget, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister, 'What was the full cost of the company tax rates proposed by this government?' The answer given to the Leader of the Opposition's question included three figures: $24 billion, then $26 billion and then $50 billion. Such was the abject confusion that the Leader of the Opposition, ever the gentleman, asked the question for a second time. When asked again to confirm the projected cost of the business tax cuts, the Prime Minister flicked to Scott Morrisonâ€”in a rather comedic displayâ€”and the Treasurer said, '$36.5 billion.' Later, in a new answer to the same question, the government finally coughed up the truth. The Treasurer revealed that this was a policy with a price tag of $65.4 billion. In a single parliamentary question time, the coalition's company tax cuts had become more expensive by over $15 billion. This is the kind of shoddy, ad hoc leadership and shoddy, ad hoc management of this country's budget that has seen our deficit and debt position so dramatically deteriorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ever since the government revealed its plan for business tax cuts, Labor has been clear that this was a plan that included not only a very large price tag but extremely minimal economic benefits to the broader economy. Let's have a quick reminder of what it is that this $65 billion cost to the budget produces for the Australian economy. By the government's own boastful measure, this is a policy that will produce a mere one per cent of economic growth over 20 years, only $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time and wages growth at record lows of 1.9 per cent. What a miserable harvest for more than $65 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families are facing a nasty cocktail of rising costs, rising electricity prices, stalling wages growth and record high unemployment and underemployment. This is a government that has nothing to offer them. Labor has long-held concerns about low wages growth. Without a doubt, the dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in the stagnant wages growth and rising inequality that now beset this countryâ€”also, at a time when the government has supported penalty rate cuts, operative from 1 July this year, and seeks to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. We now live in an Australia where a worker on $55,000 a year will pay an additional $275 a year and someone on $80,000 only an extra $400 a year. It goes to this government's approach and their misguided priorities that their answer for flat wages growth is a cut to pay and higher income taxes. How entirely unpersuasive is it when we see this country's Treasurer bemoan low wages growth while, at the same time, he speedily creates the conditions for that very same low wages growth!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear those who support this proposed tax cut for business say it is needed to drive investment, but it was only a few years ago that we had the biggest investment boom Australia has ever seen, and that was accomplished with a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. Budgets are all about priorities and this government, quite simply, has the wrong priorities. Under this government, big businesses get tax cuts, high-income earners get a tax cut, workers earning above $21,000 get increased taxes and penalty rates have been cut. Now, all of this, you thought, might have been enough to end support for this absurd policy, but it does not stop there. This government has failed on economic leadership and there's one person who is emblematic of this failureâ€”that is, the Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer is incompetent and his incapacity to do his day job is the most blindingly obvious example of this government's failure in economic policy. This is not a sudden revelation; this is a pattern of incompetence and failure that underlines how badly this government is performing. Remember the heady days at the end of 2015 when Morrison was first appointed Treasurer. At that moment in time, he was believed to be formidable and he was accepted as being a significant political actor. How times have changed. He has literally shrunk in the job. Since early 2016, we have seen him with his GST reforms stillborn, we have seen him proposing and then abandoning tax powers being given back to the states, and we have watched him collapse and faint at various moments across this country's national political conversation. He has shrunk from becoming a person of substance, a politician that was regarded by Labor as formidable, to the shrinking violet and ineffective and inarticulate spokesperson that he has become today. On his watch, this nonsensical $65 billion tax cut has been proposed, and on his watch he has manifestly failed to make out the reasons for supporting it. Treasurer Morrison was supposed to be the chief spear carrier for this government but, as it turns out, he can barely wield a water pistol. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike this government and unlike this government's Treasurer, Labor has it prioritiesâ€”priorities that will ensure we deal with inequality in this country. That means Labor is committed to funding our schools. This means proper investment in Australian infrastructure and it means a fairer tax system. A Labor government would further deal with superannuation tax concessions, something that we announced late last year and something that this government has since tried to describe as a secret superannuation tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have promised that we will level the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains taxâ€”taking on the challenge of housing affordability. Labor have announced that we will cap the deductions that people can obtain for managing their tax affairs to $3,000 per person. Announced recently, our plan to impose a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts and to deal with the issue of income splitting means dealing with some fundamental issues that have been in the too-hard basket for far too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now live in a topsy-turvy world where, from opposition, Labor has more aggressively promoted reform and more effectively articulated the need to manage the economic affairs of this country, while we have a government that, while in office, has managed to triple the deficit, expand the debt from $280 billion to more than $500 billion, and, of course, couldn't argue its way out of a wet paper bag. This is a government that, frankly, is paralysedâ€”paralysed by its incompetence and paralysed by its divisions. When it comes down to it, this is a government with simply the wrong prioritiesâ€”a government that is determined to reduce the tax on businesses, and big businesses in particular, while at the same time increasing tax on working Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made the point that, in technical terms, what is being proposed by this government is an unfunded corporate tax cutâ€”because that is what it is. There is no funding to pay for this. This is a tax cut for business that is funded by future debt. This is what, for instance, former Treasurer and former Prime Minister Paul Keating has pointed out: that it is an unfunded corporate tax cut, quite different to what he did when he was Treasurer, which was to broaden the base, go after loopholes and deal with inequities within the tax system. Paul Keating was paying for his policies. This Treasurer had a thought and said, 'Well, the politics of this ramshackle show need rescuing; I will produce a $65 billion tax cut for business.' But he is unable to fund it, unable to justify it and unable to speak to the effects it will have in our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in another sense, this government's $65 billion tax cut is funded: it is funded by the tax increases that this government has delivered for working Australians. We know that the tax burden on PAYG taxpayers will increase in coming years, and it will increase because this government is increasing the tax rate in part through increasing the Medicare levy. The Parliamentary Budget Office projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. Under this government, the tax burden grows. From 2023-24 to 2027-28, when the company tax rate is meant to decrease to 25 per cent for all companies, personal income taxes rise by 0.2 percentage points of GDP while company taxes decrease by 0.3 percentage points.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business, and they are paying it for it in the form of rising personal income taxes. This was confirmed by the PBO earlier this month, with the PBO saying that, in addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are expected to decrease due to policy changesâ€”most notably, the policy decision to increase the Medicare levy from 2019-20.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen reports in the last weeks and months that there is confusion about which companies are eligible for this government's excessive tax cuts and the contrast between active trading businesses versus companies holding passive investmentsâ€”a contrast that simply led this government into further confusion. You would have thought that, this being the centrepiece economic policy of this government, its major political survival line, the government may have had these details thought through and able to be explained. But, no, as has been shown time and time again, this is not a government that should be overestimated. This is another example of its incompetence, and its poor politics married to lousy policy.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I am happy to follow the eloquent member for Batman and his compelling and persuasive argument as to why the economic prescription of this government is completely discredited. It's not credible, because the prescription outlined by the government will not improve our economy and will not trickle down to the millions of workers who demand a wage increase. Indeed, this government has presided over the lowest wage growth in a generation. Wage growth in this country hasn't been this low since at least 1998, yet the government's answer to the question, 'What do we do about the wage crisis?' is to give an unfunded, subsidised $65 billion to big businessâ€”to banks and multinational companies. Much of that will leave this country and will not provide any benefits whatsoever. When you look at the Treasury forecast as to what benefits might flow, we are well and truly underwhelmed. Even if you can support the forecast by the Treasury that a $65 billion tax giveaway to big business has any benefit whatsoever, the Treasury forecast suggests that, at best, there will be one per cent of economic growth in 20 years. In 20 years, we will see one per cent of economic growth, which effectively would mean an increase of $2 a day in wages in 20 years. This is at a time when wage growth has flatlined at record lows of 1.9 per cent. This is not in any way an answer to the question: what do we do about the wage crisis in this country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about the Prime Minister, a former merchant banker, and his tax giveaways to his mates at the big end of town. This is about the Prime Ministerâ€”who, as always, is more comfortable in boardrooms than in depots and offices around this nationâ€”providing a gift to his mates in big business. That is what this Prime Minister is all about. This man has a mansion in Point Piper. He has accumulated an enormous amount of money. Good luck to him; he's done that. But, because of that to some extent, he has no regard for and no understanding of the struggle of working people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is completely at odds with the aspirations of working people in this country. The Prime Minister does not empathise with the challenges that households and families have in trying to make ends meet. He doesn't understand that the flatlining wages and a fall in real wages in many respects is making it harder for people to deal with cost-of-living pressures. The Prime Minister, who's always happier when he's hanging out with his mates at the big end of town, couldn't give a toss about working people in this country. You see it with the amount of legislation that's introduced into the parliament, week after week, attacking organised labour and making sure that he can undermine the ability of unions to represent workers in order to ensure that wages are depressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a coincidence that the Prime Minister wants to see retail workers' wages fall in real terms. It's not a coincidence that the Prime Minister wants to see hospitality workers' wages fall in real terms. They are low-paid workers in this country, and the Prime Minister is supporting a Fair Work decision that will see a fall in real wages for 750,000 workers in this country. Because of the Prime Minister's insensitivity to their aspirations and needs, he wants to see pay cuts to those people in real terms at a time when wage growth is at its lowest in a generation. That's what the Prime Minister thinks of working people in this country. He has no regard, no empathy and no concern for those people whatsoever. That is why the economic prescription of this government is so out of touch. It's not economically sound, it's socially unfair, it marginalises hardworking Australians and there is no answer to the question: what will the government do about the wage crisis in this country? The reason there is no answer is that the Prime Minister could not care one bit about the aspirations and needs of working people in this country. The budget reflects the values of the Prime Minister and the Liberals, and that's why Labor opposes this approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that there is a need to attend to the wage crisis in this country. Labor believes we need to invest in education and we need to invest in skills to uplift our people. We're in a knowledge based, globalised economy. Our best resource is our people. We need to invest in them to make sure that productivity rises and economic growth happens and, indeed, people share in the bounty of that growth. Yet what we have from this Prime Minister is the repudiated economic policy of Ronald Reaganâ€”trickle-down economics, which was introduced to the world in the 1980s by Milton Friedman, a now discredited economist who believed you give the big end of town as much money as possible, by way of tax cuts, and the money will somehow trickle down, by osmosis, to the people. Well, it didn't happen in America. What happened in the United States was that the middle class were hollowed out. There are people there now living below the poverty line, even though they are working a full week. They have the lowest wage growth. Inequality has widened to such a point that that country is beset with economic and political problems. Part of the reason for that is that they accepted the notion of trickle-down economics. Trickle-down economics is not the answer. It has been repudiated by the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank. No-one now supports this proposition except this out-of-touch Prime Minister and this out-of-touch government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government have a callous disregard for working people in this country. The only legislation they ever introduce in the area of employment is to undermine unions. In fact, the only thing that unites this government is what they think about unions and what they think about penalty rates. We know what they think about penalty rates. If they could rip off every worker and take every penalty rate away from every worker in this country tomorrow, they would do it. Work Choices was their dream. It's their nightmare now. They're still living with the consequences of their obscene actions when Howard was Prime Minister. But, if they could realise that again, they would do it, because they support a low-wage economy. They're happy to see an easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire economy and society. That is their dream for this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a totally different view. We invest in our people. We want to be a high-wage, high-skilled economy. We believe the way for this country to compete in this world is to ensure that we invest in our most important resource, and our most important resource just happens to be our people. That's why there's a big divide between the two major parties on investing in needs based education. We've seen this government take a decision to cut more than $20 billion from education. Our kids will be worse off as a result of the decisions taken by this government. We see an underfunding of universities in this country as a result of decisions taken by this government. We have seen 122,000 apprenticeship places disappear since the election of the Abbott-Turnbull government. They have no regard for skilling Australia. They are underfunding universities and schools and giving $65,000 million to big business. That is their answer to the problems that beset this nationâ€”to rip off workers and give tax giveaways to big business. No wonder this government is struggling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite remarkable that the government have had time to address this and yet, whilst their rhetoric has changed somewhatâ€”some focus group must have told Scott Morrison to start saying 'fair', and they have started to shift, in some way, their rhetoricâ€”their policies remain the same. They are policies that have never worked in any economy. They are totally at odds with the international bodies that have said that you need to redress inequality. Inequality is at a 75-year high. Inequality in this country is widening. The policies of the government are compounding inequality. Just take, for example, the government's decision not only to support penalty rate cuts but to impose more taxes on workers. Every worker earning over $21,000 a year will have to pay tax, and those on $55,000 a year will pay $250 extra tax, which may not sound a lot to Malcolm Turnbull, but it's a lot to a person on $55,000 a year. People on $80,000 will pay $400 extra tax. That may not seem much to the Prime Minister, but it is a lot of money for a family who might have one breadwinner making $80,000 a year. Yet, at the same time, the government is proposing a $16,400 tax cut for someone who earns $1 million a year. If you're earning $1 million a year, you will get a $16,400 tax cut. If you are earning $55,000 a year, you will get a $250 tax increase. That's at the same time that wages are falling in real terms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you happen to be a retail worker, that's at the same time that you may have just had Malcolm Turnbull put his hand in your pocket and take out some of your wages because he supports penalty rate cuts. By the way, the penalty rate cuts for retail workers haven't ended. They started on 1 July this year, but there'll be cuts next year and in 2019 and 2020. For the next four years, retail and hospitality workers who may be receiving penalty rates are going to get wage cuts. At the same time they're getting these wage cuts, they're getting tax increases. And, yet, big business and millionaires are getting a tax cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the topsy-turvy world we live in because of the Prime Ministerâ€”no understanding. He's a very clever guyâ€”just ask him! But the fact is he doesn't seem to understand what's happening in the real economy or the real world. Just go down the street, Prime Minister, and ask people, 'Do you want to get a tax increase?' They'll say, 'No.' Or even if you said this: 'You're going to get a tax increase, but someone on $1 million a year is going to get a tax cut. What do you think of that?' What do you think they're going to say to the Prime Minister? They're going to say: 'You must be kidding! You've presided over the slowest wage growth in a generation and you're giving me a tax increase?' This is why this government is in so much trouble. What's funny is the internal divisions of the government are not about these issues because they all agree. The things they all agree on are: how do we give people tax increases? How do we give penalty rate cuts to workers? That's what they all agree on. And how do we drive the union movement? That is their constant obsession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Employment is obsessed. She constantly quotes allegations about people swearing on building sites. If the minister had a swear jar for every time she swore in the Senate and she gave that money to Scott Morrison, we'd deal with our deficit! That's how often she is swearing in making allegations about swearing. What she doesn't do is say, 'We're dealing with a changing labour market.' What she doesn't redress is that people are feeling insecure at work. What the minister doesn't concern herself with is that people feel insecure because they're getting less security, and the government doesn't seem to care or doesn't seem to want to attend to it. What the government doesn't seem to understandâ€”the Minister for Employment and certainly the Treasurer and Prime Minister do not understandâ€”is that people are struggling to make ends meet. For example, there are some people who are paying off their home loans on a monthly or fortnightly basis, and they're on fine margins. We know that. It is a big thing to pay the mortgage. If interest rates go up a couple of points and wages are falling, do you think that people will be able to pay their mortgage? There'll be people who will not be able to pay their mortgage if we see a few bumps in the interest rates of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages are falling and we have a government who are complicit. Their economic policies are placing downward pressure on wages. They have no answer to the wage crisis in this country. Their only answer is to give $65 billion to Malcolm Turnbull's best matesâ€”big business. Even the Treasury has said, 'Even if the best happens with this policy, we'll see one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time.' The Prime Minister will be well gone from this place by then, of courseâ€”indeed, most of us will be. This economic prescription of trickle-down economics, which was repudiated 30 years ago and confirmed so by all of the major organisationsâ€”the World Bank, the IMF, the OECDâ€”is not working. This is just a gift to the government's mates at the big end of town, as always. There is no regard whatsoever for working people.</span>

There have been many Labor speakers in this debate, and hopefully the government will see fit to stand up at some point and defend what is a hypocritical and unfair piece of legislation. It just seems remarkable to me that the government puts forward this legislation but is not prepared to put forward speakers to defend this legislation. Perhaps there is something very much in that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to implement the remainder of the government's company tax cut plans. It will provide a tax cut of 25 per cent to companies with a turnover of over $50 million. This will create a $65 billion tax cut for business, and that is the fundamental point that every single Labor speaker has made. It's providing an enormous tax cut to the tune of $65 billion to businesses with a turnover of more than $50 million. The previous speakerâ€”and I'm sure other speakers have made this pointâ€”mentioned that the diminishing amount that you earn in fact attracts more tax, and it just makes a mockery of the government's so-called commitment to fairness. It is ridiculous that the Treasurer would stand up and use the word 'fairness' when putting forward this piece of legislation. It is anything but fair and is full of hypocrisy. That is perfectly obvious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just perfectly obvious to people within this side of politics; it's perfectly obvious to the public, particularly those that are struggling with underemployment and those that are unemployed and finding it very difficult to find for work. I was listening to the radio this morning and the point was being made there is only one job for every young unemployed person. There was a young man speaking on the radio who wanted work, who was desperately looking for work but was unable to find it in the community in which he lived. In that context, when we are seeing rising unemployment and youth unemployment rates in some parts of this country that are well into double-digit figures, this government sees fit to provide an enormous tax cut to big business. It is also at the same time we're seeing drastic cuts to budgets for essential services, including the cuts to the education budget at the primary, secondary and tertiary level. It just doesn't make sense, but it does reflect to me the chaos that this government is experiencing. It reflects the lack of capacity for this government to work as a government, and that is obvious in so many ways. That's including the fact the government is so arrogant and out of touch that it doesn't feel it necessary to provide speakers to prosecute this argument of major tax cuts to big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have never seen such hypocrisy from government, and I've been around government for a very long time in one form or another. The hypocrisies are there in terms of cutting funds to things like education, drug rehabilitation and health, yet providing an enormous amount of tax breaks to people and businesses that can most afford it. The government, which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair, is in fact pursuing such an unfair piece of legislation. This is a government which was hysterical about the debt and deficit disasterâ€”we all remember thatâ€”and hysterical about the budget emergency. Yet it proceeds with what they know to be an unfair tax cut, a tax cut that is perceived to be unfair by so many people. The government has overseen a deficit blowout and debt surging past half a trillion dollars, which is not often spoken about but that is the truth. You could almost say we have a Treasurer who has lost control of his brief. Perhaps that's why every time he gets to his feet he thinks it's necessary to yell at people. Now the government wants to deliver a $65 billion unfunded tax cut for big, multinational companies. As shadow minister for human services, I think about the disgraceful robo-debt debacle and the fact that this government saw fit to accuse at least 20,000 Australians, many of whom are vulnerable Australians, of owing the government money, and yet it proceeds with this $65 billion unfunded tax cut for big multinational companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, it's ordinary Australians who will bear the burden of the government's lavish multibillion-dollar tax cutâ€”people who are struggling, people who can't find employment and people who are underemployed. The Parliamentary Budget Office projects that personal income taxes will rise by 1.6 per cent of the gross domestic product over the medium term, from 11.1 per cent in 2016-17 to 12.6 per cent in 2027-28. At the same time, company tax receipts will decline from 2023-24 as a result of this bill. That just does not make sense. In 2023-24, personal income tax will represent 12.4 per cent of GDP, while company tax will make up 4.5 per cent of GDP. By 2027-28, personal income tax will represent 12.6 per cent of GDP, while company tax will represent just 4.2 per cent of GDP. It is clear that low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business through rising personal income taxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On all counts, this government is out of touch. It is a government that doesn't have a clue about what ordinary Australians are going through, and 21 opinion polls should tell it that. While Australian families are facing rising costs of living, rising electricity prices, falling wage growth and anaemic economic growth, the government is more concerned about giving big multinationals this tax cut. We see the enormous casualisation of the workforce, including using labour hire companies and private providers for Centrelink call centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordinary Australians are doing it tough. As has been articulated, 1.1 million Australians are underemployed. University graduates are less likely to find full-time graduate entry work today than they were a decade ago. The government is more interested in driving down the bargaining power of workers, with stagnating wage growth. The government is more interested in slashing penalty rates, while seeking to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. As the previous speaker articulated well, a worker on $55,000 will pay an extra $275 a year and someone on $80,000 will pay an extra $400. The government is more interested in attacking ordinary Australians in need of income support, slashing pension eligibility and making it more difficult to access income support when they need it. The government's multibillion-dollar tax cut for multinational companies simply adds insult to injury for ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's cut of almost 12,000 jobs in the Department of Human Services speaks loudly. It has overseen 42 million missed calls to Centrelink, which is completely unacceptable. There is a 10-month wait period for people wanting to access age pensions, and, as I said earlier, we all know about the robo-debt crisis. The government and the minister are completely unapologetic about the fear, stress and anxiety they've put thousands of Australians through, sending letters with the police logo, threatening prosecution and imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past year I've heard countless heartbreaking stories about older Australians and those with a disability being forced to wait almost a year to receive the pension that they are rightfully owed, and yet we see this multibillion-dollar tax cut going forward. The truth is that the government's track record on supporting ordinary Australians is awful. It is completely atrocious. The government is interested in attacking and victimising Australians in need of income support. It is placing the burden of its own financial mismanagement on the backs of vulnerable Australians. It is more interested in defending negative gearing or capital gains tax concessions for the wealthy. It is only interested in making it difficult, painful and fearful to claim income support, to the point where people just give up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish up in the last five minutes by saying this: Labor believes in ordinary Australiansâ€”they should be a priorityâ€”and so should any government. Labor knows there is inequality that needs to be dealt with. Fighting inequality and fighting for ordinary Australians means proper funding of schools, investing in infrastructure, a fairer tax system and dealing properly with superannuation tax concessions. Labor will level the playing field for first home buyers through reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax, and Labor will ensure a strong, comprehensive social safety net. It can and should be accessible and accountable to all Australians when they need it. People should not be made to feel frightened, anxious or intimidated. We should provide departmental staff with the necessary support they need to ensure they deliver a quality product. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to embracing policies which ensure that all Australians benefit from economic growth. This piece of legislation does none of those things. This piece of legislation says clearly to the Australian community, broadly: the government has walked away from you. Despite the fact that there have been so many cuts to essential services by this government, they are pursuing this incredibly huge tax break for big multinational companies, which just does not make sense to meâ€”it does not make sense to me electorally, it does not make sense to me politically and certainly it does not make sense to the many, many, many, many thousands of Australians who will look at this and feel left behind. What do you think happened in Murray, Cootamundra and Blacktown at the recent by-elections in New South Wales? Seats like Cootamundra and Murray were firmly National Party seats, jewels in the crown of the New South Wales government. People voted in their thousands against the ruling parties because of issues like this. They feel they've been forgotten. They feel that the government no longer understands what their concerns are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to ensuring that our industrial relations settings ensure a living wage and safe, productive workplaces. Australians are Labor's priority. Fairness is Labor's priority, not unfunded multibillion-dollar tax cuts for multinationals. I will finish by picking up on the point that the shadow minister raised, which was the obsession of this government to attack the union movement. I'd ask this government and members of this government to think about what the union movement has delivered for this country. It has delivered safe workplaces. It has delivered decent wages. It has delivered humane workplaces, and it just seems inconceivable to me that these cuts are not about demonising the union movement. The government should understand that, by demonising the union movement, they are demonising many Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday morning I attended a forum for Catholic Social Services which talked about this issueâ€”that this government, in search of a narrative, is demonising poor people. In fact, a government's responsibility, whether they be Labor, Liberal or anything else, is to lift up people, provide people with hope, provide people with choice and provide people with a decentâ€”although frugal sometimesâ€”living wage. It does not and should not include these enormous tax cuts which have been pursued ideologically and despite the fact there have been such massive cuts in other areas that affect the lives and wellbeing of people. I would also add that it affects the economic future of this country when you're attacking schools, when you're attacking tertiary institutions. I join with my colleagues in opposing this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  We are debating a proposition in the bill being put forward by the government that would see billions of dollars in tax cuts for massive businesses that operate here and abroad, at the time we're being told that there's not enough money for the other things we want to do. For people watching this, the bill is Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. In fact the words in the brackets should be replaced and it should be the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reverse Midas Touch) Bill, because everything this Prime Minister touches turns to dust not to goldâ€”every single thing. The Prime Minister was the person who decided he would change the way broadband was being rolled out in this country. What happened? We have seen the highest level of complaints about the broadband network. People are upset with the fact they expected a broadband system to deliver but it has failed to deliverâ€”thank you, courtesy the Prime Minister; the reverse Midas touch. He had something that should have made everyone happy with the government. He couldn't do it, because he stuffed up the broadband network. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have watched the other side of politics for the best part of 12 months try to come up with a game plan on energy. We've seen them twist and turn, bicker and fight and go around expert shoppingâ€”trying to find one expert after another to back in what they want to do. They have had the best part of 12 months and what have we got to? We have a 50c a week saving. That's all we have on energy: 50c a week. That is not worth the pain that the country has been forced to endure because of this government and the way they have been unable to get their act together. Now we have this: they claim that the economy will be saved if we just handover billions to companies from a budget that we're told doesn't have enough money in it. This is not a plan for economic salvation; this is a plan for political salvation. It is wrong and it's why Labor is opposing the handover of billions of dollars in this way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reports have emerged over the last 24 hours that the people who are more likely to be unemployed are those who have low skills. This should not be a surprise. Everyone has known this for a long period of time. When you look at the people who are unemployed, more often than not it is their low-skill attainment that has held them back. This government know it because in two years time they will bring in the Career Transition Assistance Program for older workers that will particularly target people in their 50s. What was one of the things that they found? They found that most people in that age bracket have a jobâ€”there's less unemployment amongst older workers; in fact, it's probably half the national unemployment rate and that is a great thingâ€”but the minute those people lose their job, they are unable to get work for an average of 73 weeks; 73 weeks without work. What's one of the biggest reasons why they've lost work and can't find it again? It is low-skill attainment and low-education attainment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I mention this is that we wanted to see more investment in schools. What did we see? The reverse Midas touch in action again when the Gonski 2.0 plan, as it was erroneously labelled, was put forward. It cut out billions from what was required in school funding. So there's the first cut: to schools. TAFE has seen billions cut out of it, and more cuts are proposedâ€”and a failure to bring in a new agreement to support it. So we have TAFE cuts. And what is happening with universities? We have billions to be cut from universities being continuously debated by a government that does not value education; it values demonising the people that don't have jobs, and for many of those people it's not because of low-skill attainment. But when we try to ensure that the next generation are as skilled as possible to get work, they are not given the chance. Why? Because the government says the money is not there, yet they can do this: they can actually saw underneath the bottom of the budget. It's like in those cartoons where you see someone sawing the floor to make someone fall through it. In this case it's the average Australian who is being undermined by a government that is cutting the support out from underneath them in a way that prevents them from being able to get ahead. That's what we're seeing with this bill. It cuts out billions from the budget and hands it over to big business, at a time when I argue those businesses are doing quite well. They have billions sitting there, but the government wants to make this massive transferâ€”and the bulk of it will go offshore anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's what their plan for political salvation isâ€”to say that they had a win. By the way, aren't all these wins translating in a great way! They had their first tranche of company tax cuts that got through. They had their changes to the backpacker tax. They had their changes to Gonski. They had changes to media reform. They are banking on all these wins, but look at where things have gone. The Prime Minister, in getting rid of the former Prime Minister, said that the government had lost its way, trailing in 30 Newspolls. But, after all these wins, how has this government under this Prime Ministerâ€”the man with the reverse Midas touchâ€”been going? It's been trailing in 21â€”getting so close to losing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's plan is to hand billions over to big business. Look at the scale of dividend growth in this country from roughly 2014 to 2017: $40 billion handed out to investors and $70 billion this yearâ€”from $40 billion to $70 billion. With this tax cut, $65 billion is what's being proposed. The money is there. Big business is handing it out, in many cases to investors. But big business is not doing the lion's share of work in terms of investing or where capex isâ€”capex is collapsing and hardly has any life to itâ€”and it's certainly not providing average wage earners with wage increases. So what do we do as a result? We hand over billions that won't go into the pockets of average wage earners, that won't be put into productive investment to make the economy grow and provide more secure work, better wages for people and better economic outcomes. We won't see that. What will happen is it will funnel into investors here and overseas and we won't see any benefit from that whatsoeverâ€”when those businesses are already sitting on the equivalent amount when you see what's being paid out in dividends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is the economic narrativeâ€”as the word is often describedâ€”of this government saying that this will provide a massive benefit to the economy. Really? Look at the stats. Since this plan was first introduced we've been able to scope out the economic benefit. What we're seeing is, potentially, one per cent economic growth in 20 years time and an increase in wages of $2 a day in 20 years time. This is in a climate where wages growth is flatlining. I think 1.9 per cent, roughly, is what's recorded. These are record lows. We see that living standards, which had been climbing, have gone backwards in the last quarter. We also see rising costs, largely driven by, as I mentioned earlier, the failure of this government to get a national energy plan in place. This has meant that the cost of electricity has gone up because there's not enough supply and demand is growing. Everyone knows what happens in that formula. The people who are bearing the price of that formula going the wrong way are average Australian households. When they are experiencing that sort of impact on their household budgets, particularly at a time when wages aren't growing, you can understand why people are anxious about their economic health. But, again, there is no answer from those opposite about how to improve wages growth and how to improve or tackle the issue of underemployment and how to get people into work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague the member for Longman and I attended a jobseekers forum that she convened last week in Caboolture, where people were saying that they found it so hard to find work and that the job programs that the Turnbull government are putting forward just aren't cutting it. This has been of great concern to the member for Longman, as it has been for other members of electorates that I've visited where jobseekers say the same thing. We spend billions on these job programs. We spend $9 billion on job programs for the 730,000 unemployed and we have 40,000 employment consultants in the country. But do you know what the most important performance stat of all is in terms of getting people into workâ€”the success rate? It's 20 per cent. For $9 billion, we have a success rate, in terms of getting people back into work through government programs, of only 20 per cent. Eight out of ten people do not find work as a result of the Turnbull government's job programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at some of the other job programs that they're runningâ€”like Work for the Dole, which has been estimated by some to only improve the employability of the people forced to go through that program by a mere two per cent. Ninety per cent of the young people that go through Work for the Dole are not in work three months after. The other disgusting thing about this program is that, 18 months ago today, one poor bloke lost his life under it, and this government has not had the decency to release the internal review that they did on that accident or outline how they've made that program safer. This is a program, I add, members, that forces young people to go through itâ€”and it doesn't deliver them a jobâ€”but it does so in a climate where there are legitimate concerns about the safety performance of that program. They don't get a job, and they're forced into a program that has massive safety concerns around it. This is wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, these programs need attention. They need a government that has answers. They need a government that can get people back into work. They need an investment in skills. And what do we have in response? We have a government that proposes handing over, in the biggest glory gift, $65 billion straight out of the budget, instead of investing in people's skills, instead of investing in people's employability and instead of making these programs work. This is a massive indictment of this government, when you look at what has been happening under their watch. They can find money to hand to big businesses that are already sitting on massive piles of cash that they're handing out in dividends to investorsâ€”$70 billion this year, which they'll hold on top of that $65 million. And what's their other answer? At a time when people are worried about their jobs, their pay and wages growth, the other answer from this government is to cut the take-home pay of average Australians. There are 700,000 Australians who are looking at a pay cut as a result of a cut to penalty rates of $77 a week being championed by those opposite. You can't get a wage increase; the best you get out of this government is a wage cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What they're doing makes no economic sense whatsoever. But this is not, as I said, a plan for economic salvation; this is a plan for political salvation by this government. No matter what it does, it cannot find a way to get clear air. No matter what it does, whatever it puts its hand toâ€”whatever it touchesâ€”turns to dust, not gold. The reverse Midas touch of this government is extraordinary. It is something to behold.</span>

It is the people that we care about and that we represent in this placeâ€”average Australians who just want to get ahead and are constantly being weighed down by the poor decisions of this government. They constantly get told that the money's not there for the things they need in terms of better health care, better education for their kids, better child care, better infrastructure and better broadbandâ€”every single thing they want to see an investment in. But then the government finds money whenever it needs it to spend on things like this, handing $65 billion to the big end of town, when you know that they have the money already and you know how this will vandalise the budget. What we are seeing from those opposite is disgraceful. Every decision they make is tortured. Every decision they make is contentious. With every single decision they make, we have to wait for the outcome of the brawl in their party room to see how the country is going to be impacted by their flawed decisions. This is another flawed decision by this government. This is why we won't support it. We support better investment in this country rather than the politicking that we have to endure from those opposite.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise today in opposition, standing against the party of economic mismanagement. It's the very party that cried foul when Labor sensibly utilised the budget to keep Australia out of a recession. You will remember the cry: it was an economic disaster and a budget emergency, despite countless international economists praising Labor's very, very fine treatment of a global crisis. Many economists agreed that the quite small debt that was accrued was nothing to be scared of. It was totally justifiable under the circumstances that were presented, and here we are, just a few years later, and the debt has done nothing but balloon under this government. You won't hear anything about that. They are very, very silent on the ballooning debt. Where is the budget emergency now? Where is the budget emergency that we heard so much about?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm starting to think that the reason that colour printers are so hard to come by in Parliament House is to hide how much red there would be on the government's balance sheet. I don't know about you, but I don't have a colour printer in my office and I think that's probably why. So here we are today with the government's legacy: an exorbitant national debt. It's set to get bigger with the government's unfunded big-business tax cutâ€”$65 billion bigger. That is not chump change, Deputy Speaker Howarth. I know you know that. You know that the people in your electorate and my electorate could do a lot with $65 billion.</span>

                    </a>  A lot of that money could go to health care, a lot of it could go to education and a lot of it could go to supporting, training and helping people into work. Instead, that $65 billion of taxpayers' money is going straight into the pockets of big business. This is at a time when company profits are soaring and wage growth has flatlined. Under this government we've seen record lows in wage growth, reaching just 1.9 per cent. With the cost of living increasing year after year after year, this is having an incredibly devastating effect. Economic data has shown that living standards, which had previously been climbing, fell backwards in the last quarter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It won't be the rich who will be hit by this move by Prime Minister Turnbull, because he's giving them a $16,400 tax cut. It won't be the rich; it will be ordinary, hardworking Australians who just deserve a fair go. But, under this out-of-touch government, they're not going to get one, because the government does not understand what it's like for people who are struggling to get by. The Prime Minister doesn't understand. His electorate of Wentworth is absolutely nothing like my electorate of Longman. While his constituents may have a median personal income of around $1,100 a week, many people in Longman struggle to feed their family on an income of around $580 a week. It is nothing like Wentworth. I'd forgive the Prime Minister's ignorance if he actually did try to understandâ€”if he listened to ordinary Australians and heard their stories, but he won't. He's stubborn. He's made up his mind without listening to all of the facts. It's no wonder he thinks that a cut to big business and banks is a good idea when we know that he only listens to his colleagues and the powerful lobby groups that wander up and down the halls of parliament and he shuts everyone else out. He hears those lobbyists claim that this hit to our economy is worth it and he hears the promises that it will drive investment, but he shuts out the fact that the biggest investment boom Australia has ever seen was when Australia had a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. That was the time of the biggest investment boom, at 30 per cent. The Prime Minister, his backbenchers and his government ministers shut out the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank, who quashed the argument that this tax cut will drive investment. They shut out anyone whose position differs from their own, and that can be very, very dangerous. It's not easy to have a proper thought in your head when you're stuck in this echo chamber. The hypocritical priorities of this government are glaringly obvious. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday during the matter of public importance discussionâ€”and I stayed for all speakers, including government speakersâ€”I was subjected to government speakers attacking the use of welfare to help vulnerable people get back on their feet. Yet here they are today advocating for corporate welfareâ€”unbelievable! They are throwing money at big businesses who turn over tens of millions of dollars each year. They're fighting to increase taxation on working Australians but slash taxes for millionaires and businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government just do not care about workers. I honestly think they have got it in for then. At every chance, they give a worker in this country another hurdle to jump over, another cut to endure, another attack to appealâ€”every single day. It's why the government trash the trade union movement at every single chance they get. The trade union movement is the organisations standing up for workers in this country. It is through the increased bargaining power of a unionised workforce that everyday Australians can actually get a voice loud enough to be heard, to stand up and face this government. That's their voice. But the government don't like it. They don't like that voice one bit. The Prime Minister doesn't like it when the united voice of Australian workers collectively matches the reaffirming 'yeses' that he likes to surround himself with. He does not like that one bit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the voices of those opposed to the Turnbull governmentâ€”I have to let you know, Deputy Speakerâ€”are growing louder. They are growing louder in cities and suburbs. They are growing louder in states and territories. They are growing louder in regional towns and communities. They are growing louder even in his own party room, of course. The government have never had a real plan for Australia. They are still stuck in opposition mode. Every time any government member gets up to speak, it's never about policy, because they know how rubbish their policies are. Instead, all we ever seem to hear the government talk about is Labor. That's all we ever hear. If we listen to question time or a debate in the chamber, we hear you talking about Labor and not about your policies. People in the political sphere often say it's the role of government to create policy and the role of opposition to pick out the flaws, but the government seem to have got it the wrong way around, because the government have no actual costed policies. Labor have had to craft our policies early to fill that void. Because the government have run out of spin to try and sell their misuse of taxpayers' money, they're attempting to pre-emptively fall into the role of opposition. It's quite interesting. I understand the government want to get some practice in before the impending electoral defeat, but now is the time to lead. Now is the time to have a plan. That's what people expect of government. Lead. Have a plan. Give us a vision. Tell us how you're going to get there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've listened to businesses and unions, we've listened to groups and stakeholders, we've heard the economic debate and we've developed a very strong plan to move Australia forward, to tackle the rise of inequality that the government's policies exacerbate time after time, to help repair the economic mess that the Treasurer's reckless misuse of taxpayers' funds has created and to ease the cost-of-living pressures for all Australiansâ€”from the seniors, who have already given so much to this country, to the youngest people, who are just starting out. While the government showers its corporate mates with unjust tax cuts, let me tell you what Labor will do. While that's happening, let's not be blind-sided. Let's look at what Labor will do. We will invest in quality education for all Australians, whether you live in Perth, Brisbane, Darwin or Hobart. We will invest in education for all Australians. This means not sneaking through cuts and mislabelling them as new funding. It means reversing the government's short-sighted cuts to TAFE and vocational education. I really wonder how this government can claim that they're all about Australian jobs when they're making it harder for people to get the skills they need to make them ready for the workforce. Instead, we're seeing them let jobs go overseas, bring overseas workers in and cut local people out of local jobs. That's what we're seeing. That is why Labor will introduce true labour market testing for 457 visas. Businesses should not be able to game the system, cutting costs at the expense of Australian workers looking for jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also committed to making strong investments in reliable infrastructure projects around Australia. We understand that, to help Australia grow, we need to build the foundations that we can then expand upon. They are foundations like unlocking the Northern Australia infrastructure fund. That's still locked away. We are trying to get it unlocked and make some really wise investment decisions in our countryâ€”decisions that will create jobs and get people into work. You don't need to go much further than my electorate. When you start moving up the coastâ€”whether you go to Rockhampton, Mackay, Cairns or Townsvilleâ€”there are people there who are ready to work, willing to train and willing to get skilled; they just need a job. Unlocking the NAIF would help do that. Stop using the money to pay the NAIF board. Unlocking it to create some jobs is what we need. The people in my electorate would absolutely welcome that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A real centrepiece of our platform is Labor's reshaping of a tax system to be fairer to Australians and not just a select fewâ€”not just the rich. A fairer tax system means a level playing field for first home buyers, for example, through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. It is not about dipping into your retirement savings. That is not what we do to help people get into housing. Dipping into your retirement savings is obviously a bandaid measure that we know will cause problems down the line, going back to what I mentioned before about a government that needs some vision and a plan. A fairer tax system also would mean capping at $3,000 the deductions that people can obtain by managing their tax affairsâ€”not being able to write-off thousands or tens of thousands of dollars by having some crafty accounting done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: a fairer tax system would impose a 30 per cent minimum tax on discretionary trusts, closing another loophole for people who've been able to forego paying their fair share of tax. We want to make sure that that gets tightened up, again, making sure that people pay their fair share of tax. A fairer tax system doesn't mean upping the taxation rate of ordinary Australians so the budget doesn't collapse entirely under the weight of a $65 billion handout to companies that don't need it. For around 85 per cent of people in my electorate who are going to be hit with a taxation rate increase, this is going to have a devastating impact on their families and their family budgets. While the government is handing $65 billion to big business and banks, they're sitting down at the kitchen table trying to work out what they're going to do with less money coming into their family budget. They are looking at that handout and trying to find some way where that looks even remotely fair or is remotely going to help them and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have policies in this country that help people get ahead, not just a select fewâ€”not just for people who are wealthy, people who are fortunate. We need policies in this country. We need a government that has vision and a plan to get there. I can't understand how anybody can stand in this place and say that a $65 billion handout will somehow trickle down to people in our communitiesâ€”how that is fair and how that is going to help those families sitting around the table, working out their family budget. I would implore that this government takes a view of creating a vision and a plan.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  Thank you to the member for La Trobe. It's always good to be here in the Federation Chamber, the place where good speeches go to die! I'm sure I have 15 minutes of remarks in me. I feel confident about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In setting the scene for the remarks I have on this bill, I would pick up, actually, on something the member for Barton said. I was here a little while ago and heard her sterling remarks. She said that this does not make sense politically, and I believe that to be true. As I will try to outline, these big company tax cuts fail the fiscal test. They fail the economic test. They fail the fairness test. But also they fail the political test. You only have to go to any everyday community in Australia and you can get a pretty quick response from people as to what they think about the idea of firing up the nation's ATM and handing away $65.4 billion of taxpayer money to big, multinational companies and big companies. If you ask most people in the street, 'What do you think you'd spend $65.4 billion on?' you would get all sorts of responses. It might be to fix the hospital system. It might be to not cut school funding by $17 billion. It might be to not threaten our world-class universities with yet another $4 billion cut. It might be all sorts of things. From my experience, I encourage those opposite to try that test. Go out into your main streets. Have a little stall in the main street up in La Trobe, or wherever you are this Saturday, member for La Trobe, and say, 'I've got $65.4 billion, people. What do you reckon we should spend it on?' I think it fails the political test. But if those opposite want to stand over there and yet again bash themselves over the head bringing this bill back againâ€”if that's what they want to do and if that's their political strategyâ€”then who are we to argue against it? I know who it will advantage at the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is part of the government's jobs and growth agenda. 'Jobs and growth'â€”remember that? People listening at homeâ€”if anyone listens to the Federation Chamber at homeâ€”may remember 'jobs and growth'. You couldn't turn on the telly in the never-ending campaign through winter without hearing: 'Jobs and growth, jobs and growth, jobs and growth!' You might have been fooled. I get the political strategyâ€”if you say it enough, maybe someone will believe it. You might have been fooled into thinking there was actually a plan because they said, 'We had a plan for jobs and growth.' If you say you have a plan, then maybe someone will think you actually have a plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it turned out, and as has been revealed, month after month, week after week, day after day, it is not a plan. It was a logo. It was blue and yellow. There was a website and a slogan, but there was no actual plan. That started to become clear to me, because I remember that it was the priority. The centrepiece of the government's economic strategy in the jobs and growth agenda were these big company tax cuts. And they introduced the legislation last year. Nothing happened. I was thinking, 'Nothing happened'â€”for this critical part of the economic plan. It wasn't even brought on for debate until March this year. Then they struck this bizarre and desperate deal with some of the senators in that moment where the Prime Minister needed some kind of legislative victoryâ€”a political win, so to speak; anything really. They put through the lower end of it, and now we're back here with the bit that really stinks. It's the bit that brings home Gina's baconâ€”the tax cuts for the top end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might also rememberâ€”it was hilarious from our side, I suppose, but it probably wasn't the best day to be a government backbencher. Member for La Trobe, we sit opposite up there every dayâ€”</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                    </a>  It probably wasn't the best day to be a government backbencher when the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister, 'How much is this going to cost?' And we had an answer of, 'Well, it's going to cost $24 billion'â€”waffle, waffle, waffle, glasses come off. 'Oh, I mean $26 billion'â€”waffle, waffle, waffle. But of course that would be $50 billion. We had one answer with three different costs. We thought that was a bit weird. So we thought we'd try asking the Treasurer, 'How much is this package going to cost?' The Treasurer said, 'Well, of course, it's going to cost $36.5 billion.' We thought, 'That's a fourth number. Maybe we'll go back to the Prime Minister.' So we asked, 'Prime Minister, how much is this package going to cost?' The answer was $65.4 billion. In just three minutes of question time, the government spent an extra $15 billion, and so there it sits. The true figure over 10 years in the long-term estimate is $65.4 billion of taxpayer funding for this tax cut for big companies and multinationals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is in an environment where there was a 'debt and deficit disaster'. But somehow, magically, just by electing the Tories of course that was going to be fixedâ€”just because they're Tories! Of course, the budget was just going to whirr back into surplus in some mystical fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The true record under the drunken-sailor spending of the previous Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, was to add $100 billion to Australia's debtâ€”it's not really in the right direction or trajectory. One of the things which really disturbs me about this is the unfunded nature of it. Sure, if you want to put forward a plan that says, 'We believe this. Here's the economic theory and here's how we're going to pay for it,' do that. That is not what this government has had the courage or policy conviction to do. There is absolutely no clarity, no explanationâ€”not even a peep about how this is going to be paid for. And we know this trick: it's what conservative governments around the world do to justify cuts to essential public services. We've seen it in America. We've seen it in other countries. You say, 'This is the critical thing: we have to cut these taxes for the top end of town, whether it's income tax cuts'â€”because the only people who got an income tax cut from this government, of course, were people who earn over $180â€”'so we'll pop that in because that's somehow the priority.' The other priority is: cut taxes for the top end of town. Then, when you get that you through, you say, 'Goodness gracious me, the deficit's got bigger. We've got a fiscal crisis. The only way to fix a fiscal crisis is to cut Medicare, cut education, cut social spending. Goodness me, the age pensionâ€”that's a bit high. We'd better go and have another hack at pensioners.' And of course the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> is littered with bills that have another hack at pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not going to be fooled by this trick. If you are fair dinkum, if you actually believe this, if you actually had any idea how to manage the budget, you would have come into the parliament and said, 'We think this is an important economic reform'â€”make the caseâ€”'and here's how we're going to pay for it. Here are the things that we're going to stop doing, Australian people. Let's be honest: here are the things that are going to be cut to pay for this enormous company tax cut.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're told that this is essentialâ€”actually, I'll just go back to the member for Hughes; probably my least favourite member for his complete lack of rationality in any of his speeches. I had the misfortune of being on chamber duty for a few months in a row and, every single time I was on chamber duty, we had the foghorn of the member for Hughes blaring across. But I discovered 'Kellynomics' from listening to his speech in March on the company tax cuts, and it goes something like this: 'Because we're going to cut government revenue by cutting company tax, actually revenue is going to increase and we'll create a surplus.' Somehow by cutting revenue, you're going get more revenue when you're the member for Hughes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he misrepresents the wonderful legacy of Paul Keating when he was Treasurerâ€”the government is obsessed with Paul Keating; they're jealous of his enormous legacy. I understand why because he transformed the Australian economy, and John Howard's government kind of coasted through living off the proceeds of that reformâ€”I still haven't heard of a single structural economic reform that those opposite can name that the Howard government implemented after the GST; they just reacted to events. But what the member for Hughes and those opposite love to claim is: 'Well, Paul Keating cut the company tax rate from 49c to 39c, and somehow Labor portrays that proud legacy because we oppose this unfunded tax cut.' There are a couple of critical points though that you conveniently miss in putting forward this misrepresentation of what occurred in the eighties and ninetiesâ€”that is, because the Treasury summary notes then that the company tax reductions have largely corresponded with base-broadening measures, such as the removal of accelerated depreciation. That's right: in plain English, the cut in the company tax rate that Paul Keating put forward was fully funded. It was clear where the money was coming from because the base of the tax was broadened at the expense of budget and important services and investments; whereas this government is putting forward a company tax cut which is unfunded. It shows the rank hypocrisy of the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reductions in the headline rate in previous years, such as Paul Keating's, were funded through making the tax more efficient and broadening the base. It is a special kind of love that you have discovered of late for Paul Keatingâ€”and actually we hear a lot about John Curtin and Ben Chifley as well; we don't hear much about your own legacy. I will read again into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> an extract of what Keating said in 1998. It goes: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government is to cut the corporate tax rate in one step, from 49 cents to 39 cents, to give Australian companies a tax structure more than competitive with the rest of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the government has decided to lower the tax rates by removing some tax concessionsâ€”</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">â€”that is, lower the company tax rate by broadening the base; not just take $65 billion out of the forward estimates, give it away to big business for little to no economic benefit and call that reform. That's Kellynomics. Apparently we should all be in a race to the bottom on company taxâ€”and we have to do it because some other countries have a bit of a lower headline company tax rate, therefore we should. Presumably, if you take that logic, if President Trump cut the company tax rate to 15 per cent, then we'd have to match that, and then someone would cut it to 10, and we'd cut it to 10â€”and zero would be nirvana. So we would have no tax revenue and somehow that would be a perfectly competitive world! Of course, you'd have to cut all government spending, but we don't actually get to that part of the conversation of how we are going to fund this ridiculous tax cut. That's Kellynomics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are you doing this? What's the government's stated policy reason for doing this? There's the global competitiveness bit, even though any sensible economist will tell you that the headline rate is not the correct comparator. You just take the headline rate and say, 'We'll compare that to another headline rate.' The US Congressional Budget Office is the most respected and well-developed budget office in the world, providing independent budget analysis for the Congress there. Our PBO, relatively young in its life, is learning from it, but that's a different story. But the Congressional Budget Office in America has said: 'You don't look at the headline rate. That's for dummies. That doesn't mean anything. You look at the effective tax rate that companies actually pay.' When you look at the effective tax rate, that is not 30 per cent in Australia. I think that on the last figuresâ€”I haven't got them in front of meâ€”it was in the order of 24 per cent, which is a very different proposition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What you also find, if you've worked in investment facilitation and think broadly, is that the company tax rate, headline or effective, is but one of the many inputs that companies take into consideration in making investment decisions. I used to work in the Victorian government, in the economic development department, in the trade and investment facilitation area, and it's a very sophisticated methodology. You look at all sorts of things. We should not be ashamed in Australia that we have high-quality public services. This is something to aspire to, and you need money to provide themâ€”not that that has dawned on those opposite, because apparently you can just take money out of the budget and not worry about where it's coming from. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other things: the stability of our financial system, the reliability of our regulatory environment, the rule of law, the quality of life, the human capital, the kinds of skilled workers you can get in Australia if you choose to invest, the infrastructureâ€”putting aside the NBN, 'fraudband'; that actually is a problem, as we move down the competitiveness rankings. But all of these things are factors which are properly taken into account in the real world, the grown-up world, in making investment decisions. It's not just some race to the bottom on company tax as the only thing that matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purported gain is one per cent. This is the best estimate. The Treasury figures, the ones that the government is relying on, show a one per cent gain in 10 to 20 years. In 10 years something might start happening, and after 20 years it might get to one per cent. What does that mean? It means $2 a day in wages in 20 years timeâ€”for spending $65 billion over the next 10 years. That sounds like a pretty dumb return to me, but perhaps the political strategy of the Prime Minister, 'Mr 50c', is shining through. He's now adding 50c off your electricity bill in 10 or 20 years time, so you might get $2.50! Maybe that's it. Maybe that sort of spread-copper, burn-coal, spin-crap election strategy that we're starting to see emergingâ€”</span>

                    <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I'm sure the member for Bruce will reflect on the standing orders. I wasn't going to speak on this particular matter, but the member for Bruce inspired me with his rhetoric and passion for the subject. I, too, want to speak about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. Deputy Speaker Howarth, you've obviously heard that, on this side, there have been a lot of concerns raised about the net benefit for our economy if the $65 billion tax cut goes through. I've heard a lot of observations from our perspective that it will not be terribly much. That's in the spirit of bipartisanship. That was really driven home to me. I would categorise myself as someone in the Labor Party who is pro-business. I have worked with businesses in a whole range of areas in my previous life. If I thought this was a good idea and I thought this would actually generate the prosperity that this government says it is going to generate, then not just I but also others on our side would support this proposed tax cut, but that's not what I see at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I deal with businesspeople a lot. For the parliamentary record, when I was parliamentary secretary to Kevin Rudd, particularly during the global financial crisisâ€”the one that is often denigrated on the other side; the one that we say wasn't as bad as people were sayingâ€”we worked very closely with business. It's important to lay the groundwork for why I say that the $65 billion could be better spent and could be backed up with appropriate savings. If I go back in historyâ€”and it does tie into the enterprise tax planâ€”we started detecting a substantial softening in the US economy, particularly when we saw the collapse of Lehmann Brothers. I'm glad I'm able to talk about this, because it's one of the great failings of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era that they were never able to get a proper description of what we were facing during the global financial crisis, due to the internal dynamics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hoped that your side of politics, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, had learnt from us, but I think you took the wrong lessons from us. I think you're now reaping the dividend of that cancer in the way you deal with unpopular leaders or have difficulties with leaders. That's not an attack on you; it's just an observation. When you are consumed by the discussion about internal dynamics, your government doesn't get the message out about what it wants to achieve and what it has achieved for the economy. During that particular period of time, particularly with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, businesses generally were facing diabolically bad conditions, and they weren't talking about tax cuts then, I can tell you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We faced two difficulties. I can recall being party to a number of very serious conversations about the economic difficulties that we faced. The first one was stabilising the world financial order. When I spoke to Lindsay Tanner, who was then our finance minister, he said that the world had a financial heart attack on three occasions and, in effect, the entire world financial system was close to collapse. Australians don't realise that. Australians don't realise that a lot of businesses were going to basically hit the wall. We were facing the most grave consequences in terms of what might happen since the Great Depression. That's how bad it was. It's interesting, when we have this discussion now about this particular bill and the $65 billion tax cut, to reflect on what actually occurred then. That informs Labor's view a lot on how to best support business productively so that it can grow in a market that is still affected by the vestiges of the global financial crisis. When a lot of the economic commentators spoke about the global financial crisis and how Australia came out of it, I always detected an underlying fragility. I think it's still there. I think it affects big business and small business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But my point is that we basically faced a situation where the global financial order was going to collapse. What stopped it collapsing here in Australia was the bank guarantee. I meet with businesses. I deal with businesses across the areaâ€”and I'll touch on that in a second and tie it to this particular bill. The Prime Minister formed a special committeeâ€”I think it was the SBPC, the strategic budget priorities committeeâ€”and I recall having a discussion on the weekend that the SBPC was meeting. There was a lot of criticism about the SBPC, but we were facing a situation at the end of that particular week in October where, if the Australian government had not taken action, there would be a run on the banks the following week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do I talk about business? The reason that I talk about business is that, on the weekend that the SBPC was meeting, I sat down with a gentleman who had developed a lot of property around Dandenong and the surrounding areaâ€”someone who was not necessarily pro-Labor but someone I would speak to from time to timeâ€”and, while we were sitting there having breakfast, he said, 'If you don't provide a bank guarantee for my business, I'm taking $16 million out of the bank next week.' I thought that that was bluster and I said, 'You can't be serious.' He said, 'My savings aren't safe; I'm taking the money out of the bank'â€”he was a liquid businessperson, a successful businessperson, not a spendthriftâ€”and I thought, 'This is getting very serious.' If you remember what Ken Henry said when we talked about this period of time, you'd recall that he talked about his mother basically wanting to take money out of the bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People underestimate what it was like for businesses during that time. At that time, I dealt with Gerry Ryan, who's the head of Jayco, and we would convene meetings with large businesses in the Dandenong area. These were not publicised. They were important meetings that were put together with major retail chains and major manufacturers that formed the bulk of employment in the Dandenong region. This was slightly out of my area, and I would ask, 'What can we do to protect your businesses? This was around the same periodâ€”late 2008-09. Gerry started to convene these meetings so that I could talk with big businesses and small businesses directly, who said, 'We've got to have stimulus in the economy; otherwise, we're going to start laying off thousands of workers.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the thing for critics of the then government's stimulus packageâ€”and again it relates to this particular billâ€”is the question around what business needs to create jobs and opportunity. When I hark back to that period of time, what business needed was spend on infrastructure and the creation of confidence in the community. I won't go into the details of the meetings, because these meetings were held with up to 14 or 15 members of the business communityâ€”and my staff member was there at that time. We were literally facing this yawning chasm of: 'My God; employment is going to collapse in the south eastern region of Melbourne.' It was that close.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worrisome thing, when I look at this bill and the $65 billion we're talking about, is that everyone has forgotten what Australian businesses were facing and what the Australian government needed to do to keep those businesses afloat. The first component was to stop the run on the banksâ€”and that's what happened with the bank guarantee. I noticed that former Treasurer Wayne Swan was speaking here yesterday about BHP and its role. The former Treasurer was obviously right at the coalface in terms of what happened there, and he was talking about businesses that don't pay taxâ€”and I'll talk about that briefly later on. But people forget that we needed to create confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measureâ€”regardless of what side of politicsâ€”is to inject liquidity into the system, which we did with the first stimulus in November-December that year. That lifted retail. Retail is the canary in the coalmine. If retail is doing well, it's a good canary. When it was not doing well, major retailers were telling me, 'We're sacking.' They were getting ready to sack thousands of workers for the Christmas period in 2008. That didn't happen. That was, I think, a government working constructively with small business and big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we established the infrastructure projects. Again, we would have differences about how that money was spent. When I looked at the number of tradespeople in my constituency whose jobs were saved by those stimulus packages that built those buildings that the opposition, the now government, were criticising, I was seeing a person, a livelihood, a lifestyle, potentially taken away. My point is: when I look at what the government's putting forward, I see a measure that is not going to deliver the economic benefits that the government wants and that will be at a substantial cost to the economy and to its own reputation really. There are better ways of doing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, when I talk to businesses now, they're not saying, 'Don't give us a tax cut.' They're saying, 'Build more infrastructure.' There are Liberal supporters and coalition supporters. I wouldn't go so far as to say they were talking like socialists, but when you're talking about people that I would regard as being in the far right of the Liberal party and they are saying to me, 'I want you guys in the state government to concentrate on infrastructure,' not one person has mentioned a tax cut. We're proposing $65 billion worth of tax cuts, and these are big businessesâ€”they don't talk about thisâ€”like Jayco, for example. Gerry Ryan hasn't come up to me and said, 'I would like a tax cut'â€”and they employ 800 people. They are a world-leading manufacturer of a great product. Gerry has another wing, his dinosaur creatures company, which features in Hollywood. I think that's about a $130 million enterprise. This is a man that does business overseas. This are one of the people that your government is targeting with this tax cut, but he's not saying we need this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, when I look at the rationale for why we need this, it's just not evident. I accept that the government has put forward its reason, but we've heard speaker after speaker on our side debunk that. We're not opposing this because we just like opposing it; we're opposing it because we think the $65 billion, if it needed to be spent, could be spent in much more effective ways. For example, I have two headspaces in my regional area. They happened as a consequence of lobbying that my office did with a group of incredible young students in 2012 because we had a suicide cluster. If anyone has lived in a region where you see young people killing themselves in the numbers that they did in my constituency, you don't want your worst enemy to live through that; I can assure you of that. What we did was lobby the then governmentâ€”and there was resistance from our side, so I'm not saying this was an easy thing. We did a program with <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> called 'There is no 3G in heaven'. What the then Gillard government did was direct, I think, up to $6 millionâ€”$3 million for the headspace in Dandenong and $3 million for the headspace in Narre Warren. At least we did something with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I went back to that headspace again as part of national Mental Health Week and headspace day. I met with the young people and I heard about the lives that are being saved. As I was saying, when you've been through an area that's been as scarred as that region, particularly with the young people that had been killing themselves, you ask: 'What do they need?' If you talk with them afterwards, they say, 'We need funding certainty because, beyond 2019, we're not quite sure if we can still function.' We have massive population growth down our way and, as someone who's lived through that experience of young people hurting themselves in this way, the fact that there's not a guarantee of the funding for an essential service that protects and saves young people blows my mind. If I saw something in this bill that basically said, 'We're going to put $120 million to national headspace,' I would say congratulations to your side of politics, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth. I would like that, but there's nothing there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are tax cuts to businesses that sometimes, in effect, pay no tax. I have here, in my hand, an article from ABC News titled: 'Who pays what? ATO names large companies that paid zero tax in 2014-15'. It says there are 670 large companies that paid no corporate tax in the 2014-15 financial year, and 1,900 public, private and foreign-owned entities for the 2014-15 income year paid no tax. I could spend a couple of hours reading through these figures. For example, you have a company with an income of $216 million and there's no tax payableâ€”that's quite extraordinary. My view is that we can't support this particular tax cut. There are better ways of doing this. I respectfully put to you and to the government that this bill be reconsidered.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249908" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I rise in this place today to ask the Turnbull government one very simple question. Is this government kidding, giving a $65 billion tax cut to big business? Is the Turnbull government so out of touch with the Australian people that it honestly believes that giving a big tax cut to big business is what this country needs to move forward? This government needs a reality check, and I am more than happy to provide it. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison, listen carefully to these facts. Growing inequality in this country is one of our fastest growing concerns, and the government should be addressing it. Inequality is at a 70-year high. More than 105,000 people are homeless. One-third of Australian aged pensioners are living in poverty. Thirty-two per cent of unemployed people live in poverty, and the HILDA report showed that child poverty is growing. Wage growth hasn't been this low since the retention of records began.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Bureau of Statistics has collected data since 1975 on earnings inequality. Profits have gone up by 40 per cent, but wages have gone up by less than two per cent. Real wages have grown by 72 per cent for the top 10 per cent of earnersâ€”in 1975 they earned twice as much as the bottom 10 per cent, but by 2014 it was nearly three times as much. If low-wage earners had enjoyed the same percentage gains as the highest paid, they would be $16,000 a year better off. The richest one per cent of Australians own more wealth than the bottom 70 per cent of Australians combined. For every dollar a male earns, a woman earns 82c. A total of 678 corporations and 48 millionaires paid no tax. How completely messed up are the Turnbull government's priorities! It wants to give a $65 billion tax cut to big business and not address homelessness and stagnant wage growth or assist Australians living in poverty. What kind of government does that? It is an out of touch, out of its mind, incompetent, right-wing government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there are the facts about my community of Herbert. We are a strong and resilient community, and we have experienced our fair share of knocks. But the Turnbull government is insistent on kicking us while we are down. Unemployment in Townsville is at 8.9 per cent. Youth unemployment is just under 25 per cent. To add to those very high unemployment figures, we also have a very high underemployment situation. Personal insolvency is amongst some of the highest rates in the country. We are drought declared and on level 3 water restrictions. Our electricity prices have skyrocketed, with some local businesses even choosing not to run their air conditioners in 33-degree heat. Yes, there are projects coming, and yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Even so, there is still serious concern over the potential lack of skills to deliver those projects, and that includes apprentices and trainees, a fact that is definitely not helped by the Turnbull government's more than $2 billion cut to TAFE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of our community's get-back-up-and-get-going, never-say-die attitude, we will come through these challenges. But our success and survival will not come from the Turnbull government. It will come because we work hard and we are resilient. It will come from federal Labor backing and supporting our community with $100 million towards vital water infrastructure. The vision for our community will come from a federal Labor government, which has committed $200 million towards hydropower on the Burdekin Falls Dam. It will come from strong investment by the Queensland Labor government, which has also invested in water, infrastructure, roads and the CBD revitalisation. It will come from the local council and local community leaders, like Brad Webb, who have stepped up, united and worked collaboratively to assist in addressing these issues. Most importantly, our survival will be the result of the united Townsville community, who continue to support each other and local businesses through tough times. But assistance to Townsville, our workers, families and pensioners will not come from the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut. Interestingly, the assistance that is coming from the Turnbull government will aim to have Australians believe that giving big businesses a tax cut will eventually trickle down to workers' pay packets and create more jobs. The theory of trickle-down economics has been around for over 40 years. I, along with many other workers and families, am still waiting to see exactly what does trickle down, because, at this stage, the only thing that is trickling down is inequality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut will have minimal economic impact. It's barely even measurable: one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time, and a $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time. This is at a time when wages growth has flatlined at a record low of 1.9 per cent. Recently released economic data show that living standards that had been climbing have gone backwards in the last quarter. Australian families are facing a nasty cocktail of rising costs and electricity prices, stalling wages growth and resulting in record-high underemployment, and the Turnbull government has nothing to offer. Labor has long-held concerns about low wages growth. Without a doubt, the dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in the stagnation of wages growth and in rising inequality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when the government have also supported penalty rate cuts from 1 July this year, they also seek to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with an income above $21,000. A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year in tax, and for someone on $80,000 it's an extra $400 in tax. How is it fair that a worker on $55,000 a year will pay $275 more when big businesses are paying less. It's clear that, in the form of rising personal income taxes, low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business. This was confirmed by the Parliamentary Budget Office earlier this month, with the PBO saying that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are projected to increase due to policy changes, most notably the policy decision to increase the Medicare Levy from 2019-20.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBO projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. This is a government that has totally confused the Robin Hood message, because they take from the poor and give to the rich in the form of taxation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Turnbull government is looking for ideas on how to spend $65 billion that would improve the situation in this country, particularly in my electorate, I have a very long list of ideas. Provide water security for Townsville and match Labor's commitment for $100 million. Provide hydropower generation on the Burdekin Falls Dam and match Labor's commitment of $200 million. Complete the rollout of Labor's NBN, as the NBN will be the greatest new infrastructure for regional, rural and remote Queenslandâ€”but only if we have fibre to the curb or premises. Reverse the $401.8 million in cuts to Queensland universities, in particular the $37.1 million cut to James Cook University in North Queensland. Reinstate the cuts to the Townsville Health and Hospital Service. Stop the $300 million in cuts to public dental services, where, across Queensland, waiting lists have blown out to 117,000 people. End the GP freeze on everythingâ€”an issue that is holding our doctors and medical practices to ransom. Stop the cuts to pathology. Re-establish Labor's Health Workforce Australia, which was working on retaining doctors in regional, rural and remote areas, because right now in Townsville we are facing a GP registrar crisis. Commit to ongoing funding for the Townsville Salvation Army for the youth drug and alcohol detox facility. End the more than $2 billion in cuts to TAFE. Stop the more than $2 billion in cuts to aged care. Don't raise the working age to 70. Don't cut the energy supplement. Spend more on infrastructure. Commit and sign off on even one project from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. There are a number of ways that $65 billion could be better spent than on a $65 billion big business tax break that will contribute to the growing inequality divide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have the priorities right. We will ensure we deal with inequality in this country by properly funding needs based funding for schools; investing in job-creating infrastructure; establishing a fairer tax system; dealing with superannuation tax concessions, which is something that we announced late last year and yet somehow the government has now decided that it is a secret superannuation tax; levelling the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax; capping the deductions people can obtain for managing their tax affairs to $3,000; and imposing a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts to deal with income splittingâ€”dealing with something that has been in the too-hard basket for far too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast we have a government that has its priorities all wrong. It is a government determined to reduce the tax on businessesâ€”big business in particularâ€”while at the same time increasing the tax on everyday working Australians who are just trying to get ahead. Only Labor will stand and fight to eliminate inequality, only Labor will stand up for workers, families and pensioners, and only Labor will deliver a fairer tax system for every citizen in this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  Last week I was honoured to meet student leader representatives from Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College in Kensington. It was a very articulate and passionate group of representatives who had sought a meeting with me to discuss the urgency of taking action on climate change and to deliver to me a petition, signed by no fewer than 700 constituents of Kingsford Smith, calling on the Commonwealth parliament to take greater action on climate change, to be serious about this issue and to ensure that Australia is making a transition to renewable energy. The petition outlines the threat that climate change is having to the health, wellbeing and security of the people of the world, particularly some of our poorest and most vulnerable neighbours. It points out that Australia has the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions of any nation in the world, yet we have some of the weakest emissions reduction targets under this government. The petition calls on the Australian parliament, us as representatives, to do more to protect Australians from the threat of climate change and our neighbours through deeper cuts to emissions targets and greater commitment to renewable energy. I wish to congratulate the girls who came to see me and all who signed the petition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's incredibly sad that it's been left to young Australians, to students, to point out that the Abbott-Turnbull government is failing them when it comes to taking fair dinkum action to reduce Australia's carbon pollution and take action on climate change. These students expressed their frustration about the weak targets and the weak approach of the government on this issue. The weakness exhibited by the Prime Ministerâ€”who used to believe in climate change and used to believe in strong action on reducing carbon emissions; hell, he even voted for it in the parliament; he crossed the floor to vote for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and subsequently abandoned itâ€”means that it will be left to the next generation of younger Australians to clean up the mess that the Abbott-Turnbull government created due to their lack of action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the girls I had a very thoughtful and passionate discussion about the fact that in Australia our carbon pollution is on the rise again. After falling during the period of the Labor government when we put in place a price on carbon emissions, carbon pollution is actually increasing in Australia at the moment. There is a cost associated with that for individuals, families, communities and the Australian people. That cost comes in the form of increasing insurance premiums, in the form of repairing damaged infrastructure and in the cost of increasing health care. Passing on that cost to young people is irresponsible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott-Turnbull government have actively taken steps to reduce the amount of renewable energy that we have here in Australia. They've done this by recently cutting the Renewable Energy Target and, with the announcement this week on the so-called new energy policy, they're pledging to phase out completely the Renewable Energy Target from 2020. They removed the price on carbon emissions in our economyâ€”a mechanism that was working to put a price on the cost of carbon emissions and reduce them over time. We actually saw that carbon pollution in Australia was falling during the Labor government, and the funds that were raised from that were pumped into the development of clean energy through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They're trying to delay the closure of dirty coal-fired power stations that have come to the end of their natural life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is ignoring the interests of young people when it comes to climate change, but we're also letting down our neighbours. We had a passionate discussion about the fact that, in the Pacific, climate change is a present danger and we're letting down countries like Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands where communities are actively facing the threat of sea-level rise, where wells are becoming salinised, where crops are drying up and populations are looking to move off those islands. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who signed the petition, I tell you: I and my Labor colleagues understand your frustration. We accept that climate change is real. We accept that it's doing damage and we will take greater action to reduce pollution and increase renewables. We will commit to doing more. We will not abandon young Australians when it comes to this issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248969" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  Recently, I had the pleasure of welcoming the Minister for Urban Infrastructure to Dunkley. I am delighted to advise my colleagues in the chamber that the business case for the electrification and duplication of the Frankston train line to Baxter is finally on track and going ahead, as the state government have now agreed to get on board. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 22nd of September was a momentous day as it was the day that we were able to announce that, after the federal funding had been on the table and been ignored for almost a year, the state government had now agreed to pursue the business case for the Baxter electrification that I announced prior to the federal election last year, with $4 million of federal funding going towards this business case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Langwarrin, Frankston South and Baxter in Dunkley, as well as places further down such as Somerville and Moorooduc in my neighbour the Minister for Health's electorate of Flinders, are a part of a major growth corridor on the Mornington Peninsula, and the demand for better public transport services is clear. Frankston Station, currently, bears the burden of being the last metro station on the line, and so many residents who live further down the peninsula currently park at Frankston to catch the train into the city. By extending the metro line, more Dunkley residents will be able to take the train from their local station, and the burden will be eased on the stations at Frankston, Kananook and Seaford, benefiting both locals at the revitalised stations and those at the current metro stations further up the line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Baxter electrification project will help connect businesses, education facilities, institutions and health centres. It will create 4,000 jobsâ€”not to mention the indirect jobsâ€”cut unemployment in our area by up to one per cent and reduce youth disengagement by up to two per cent. Transport congestion would be eased. Additional benefits will be provided for peninsula tourism, for Monash University peninsula campus, where enrolments are expected to increase by up to 20 per cent, for Chisholm TAFE, as well as for the rest the region, by making the peninsula more accessible by public transport and by establishing a demand for reverse commuting. The electrification will extend the metro rail to Frankston Hospital, providing much-needed accessibility and easing the parking issues at the hospital; Leawarra station, at the university; a new Langwarrin railway station; and Baxter station, which would open the door for park-and-ride options as well as the relocation of stabling yards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the extent of opportunities that come with the Baxter electrification are still being met by some resistance from the Andrews Labor government in Victoria. They have determined that they will plough through with the wasteful effort to move the Carrum train stabling yards from Carrum to Kananook in Seaford, risking the livelihoods of 200 employees over several businesses, some of which have been established at the current site for over 50 years. Colleagues will recall my previous mentions of Steven Page, owner of Page Brothers Jayco, whose land is being compulsory acquired by the state government, derailing his business, which has been built up over so many years, and placing jobs in jeopardy. Not only was this move of the stabling yards to Seaford never necessary, but it breaks your heart that the state Victorian government has opted to attack a Victorian leisure and lifestyle institution when an alternative has been presented by means of our Baxter electrification plan for stablingâ€”an alternative that was an option long before the stabling yards move was announced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be joined recently by the new Liberal candidate for Carrum, Donna Bauer, as well by the member for Hastings and the shadow small business minister, Neil Burgess, in their efforts advocating against the Victorian state Labor government's plans to move the stabling yards to Seaford and take 200 jobs. Plenty of currently unused land exist at or near Baxter station. It makes sense that the stabling yards are relocated there to vacant, unused land rather than harming a number of local Dunkley businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull coalition government's $4 million business plan has the support of the local council, who are also devastated to see the harm to our local industries by the reckless and short-sighted Andrews Labor government. There is so much potential for infrastructure and development opportunities with the Baxter electrification project. The Dunkley community and I would hate to see it wasted or manipulated to the detriment of our local businesses. We are calling for the support of the state Labor government to ensure that this project goes ahead and benefits everyone in Dunkley, including all of those businesses in Seaford who are potentially now going to lose their businesses and risk jobs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  Our federal court system is in a dire state, and it is a direct result of mismanagement and neglect by the Attorney-General. Tomorrow, Federal Court staff are taking protected industrial action in the form of a half-day work stoppage. This is the first time in 25 years they have had to do so. This is not a step that court staff ever wanted to take. These are people who deal with an overwhelming workloadâ€”day in, day outâ€”processing cases and those caught up in them. It is work which is often very emotionally demanding. These staff have been pushed almost to breaking point by a crisis in resourcing, which has created a huge backlog in court hearings. The government's failure to appoint more court registrars has put pressure on the system, and the underfunding of legal assistance services has increased the number of unrepresented litigants, who often rely on court staff for guidance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Insult has now been added to injury and court staff have been forced to reject a recent EBA that offered them a pay increase of just one per cent over three years and cut a range of conditionsâ€”and that is after four years of no pay rise at all. I met a number of delegates during the last sitting period in Canberra. Some had worked in the courts for more than a decade. They loved their job, even though it was hard and had gotten harder under this government. They were at their wit's end with the EBA process. They'd never had to mobilise to protect their pay and conditions before, but they were willing to do so now. It is not right or just that these court workers should be put in this position. The last thing they want to do is cause further inconvenience to people who use the courts and who are already suffering because of chronic delays in the court system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These workers would not even be in this situation were it not for Senator Brandis's chronic neglect of the court system. This is how bad it is. The court executive cannot even give its hardworking staff a pay rise in real terms. I say to you, Senator Brandis and Senator Cash: fix it. This cannot go on. Give these workers what they deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis's neglect of the court system has long been perplexing. There have been inexplicable delays in appointing judges to jurisdictions that could not afford to be without one. That includes Newcastle, where Senator Brandis refused to fill a vacancy for a Federal Circuit Court judge for seven months. This was a jurisdiction that was already under huge pressure. Senator Brandis nearly pushed it to breaking point. By the end, there was a 19-month delay in hearings. This kind of thing destroys families. It was thanks to the good work of my colleague the member for Newcastle, who embarrassed Senator Brandis into action, that Senator Brandis finally appointed a replacement, only last month. Only he can explain why he thought it was acceptable for him to take that long. Only he can explain to Newcastle families why he thought it was acceptable to prolong their already painful Family Court matters. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Senator Brandis has indicated he is planning a huge shake-up of the Family Court system. We know this because he has appointed a Chief Justice who has only one year left to go before he retires. But we have no idea what Senator Brandis is planning, and who knows if he will even be around in a year's time to oversee this so-called shake-up? Perhaps he's planning to oversee it from Hyde Park Corner, London. Given Senator Brandis's long history of neglect of the courts, and those in them, you must forgive me for being concerned about whatever plans he may have. He should come clean and say what they are. It's not good enough for the federal Attorney-General to simply hint at massive changes to the court system, possibly a complete replacement of the Family Court with some other court arrangement. He needs to tell the Australian people what he has in mind. He needs to consult with users of the court, with the legal profession, with all Australians, so that we can all participate in the future of the court system that is, at the federal level, the most used by the largest number of Australians. It is not too late to improve your legacy, Senator Brandis. You can start by respecting the staff of the federal courts.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I rise to support the draft findings of the Productivity Commission's report into horizontal fiscal equalisation and rebuke the insincere GST fix offered by federal Labor. In the 26 town hall meetings I've held over the past six months, my constituents have made one thing crystal clear: Western Australians are being ripped off by the current GST system, and something has to be done. I agree and I am proud to say that the Prime Minister agrees too. The Prime Minister has acknowledged the system is broken, and, with this draft report, has provided a solid step towards a remedy. That's what leadership looks like. Leaders identify a problem and they seek solutions. Sadly, in recent weeks we have seen members of the federal Labor Party do the exact opposite. WA federal Labor, for example, claim to have a solution, but a reading of their submission to the Productivity Commission demonstrates that they are slavishly wedded to the current system, at the expense of their home state. They put words in the mouths of Western Australians when they write: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is that our local community is not particularly concerned by the specifics of formula adjustments or policy framework. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Perth even called the GST rip-off 'an unprecedented blip on the radar of horizontal fiscal equalisation'. We shouldn't be surprised, though, by the politics driving their ignorance of reality. Bad leadership starts at the top, and the Leader of the Opposition is Australia's very own populist chameleon. He's got his eye on the prize and he knows he needs to carry South Australia and Tasmania in the next election, so he won't seek to rebalance the formula to incentivise those states to invest in their own productivity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor now stands in the path of meaningful reform. Like the boy who cried wolf, they called for change but, when it came knocking, they were found wanting. On this side of the House we do things very differently. We believe that every act of government should be judged by a simple test: is it in the best interests of Australia and Australians? When we apply the best-interests test to the GST model we arrive at a definitive no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For guidance I take great pleasure in turning to the Liberal Party's federal platform. Unlike Labor's draconian hardback that sprawls over hundreds of pages, our platform is a tight 16 pages and still provides pearls of wisdom. It says, for instance, that we believe in reward for effort as the proven means of providing prosperity for all Australians. Believing in the principle for reward for effort, we in WA have cultivated our mineral and energy industries and have been repaid by watching our royalties flow to states that have actively chosen not to take the same path under successive Labor governments. Thankfully, the Productivity Commission's draft report has identified what we in WA have known for some time. This model does harm to those who seek to raise their state's prosperity through hard work and resourcefulness. The distribution model as it currently stands encourages idleness and imposes a framework of passive governmentâ€”sit back, enjoy the ride and wait for someone else to do the heavy lifting. We in the Liberal Party repudiate this way of thinking. It flies in the face of our philosophy by encouraging policymakers to disincentivise mining activity and investment in the resources sector. Rather than striving for equality of opportunity, a basic Australian principle, the GST distribution model mandates equality of outcome. This system chokes incentives for prosperity and instead celebrates uniformity, as though every state had the same characteristics, all the while overlooking the really important things that make each part of our Commonwealth distinct and different and valuable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, the current system chastens ambition and weakens the ideal of prosperity. As a Liberal and Western Australian, I ask on behalf of my home state: where is the reward for our effort? I can answer that. In the current system, it is lining the pockets of those less risk-taking, less ambitious Labor state governments. I look forward to the report from the Productivity Commission and I look forward to both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, unlike federal Labor and WA Laborâ€”</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I take it from the previous member's speech that the Prime Minister has decided now to cut the amount of GST flowing to South Australia. It is an outrageous decision by this Prime Minister, and he will be held to account in the next federal election. But I don't rise to speak about that today. I rise to draw attention to the impact of the Liberal government's failed NBN plan. I feel like a broken record in this place. For 10 years now I have been raising the issue around broadband. When Labor was in government we had a proper plan to fix it. Indeed, we see that the suburbs that have fibre to the home are now enjoying the benefits of high-speed broadband. Unfortunately, there are many suburbs that missed out on Labor's plan and are now being saddled with the inferior, 100-year copper network. This is just a short-sighted solution to a massive problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was not surprised to hear in the recent report that complaints about the National Broadband Network have increased significantly. In fact, we have seen a 65 per cent increase, according to reports, of problems with the internet. Well, what we hear from the Prime Minister in response to this is: 'It's not my problem. It's someone else's fault.' No, Prime Minister, it's your fault. It's your fault for failing to deliver a decent NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently held a well-attended NBN forum in my electorate, and we heard a litany of complaints. It was disappointing that we didn't have anyone from NBN there. There was a litany of problems which highlighted the issues around NBN. Of course, most people were frustrated that they were seeing a fibre-to-the-node plan after years of struggling with ADSL2. For many, there isn't enough copper in the ground for them to even get an ADSL connection. The news that they got was that they were going to have more copper. This is an incredibly frustrating situation for so many who need to have decent internet. Now, we know those on the other side think the internet is, as the previous Prime Minister described it, 'an entertainment system'. They don't see it as a serious productivity infrastructure measure, and it is disappointing that we see no commitment from those on the other side. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to highlight a number of common themes that were raised. One is that many people who were connected to the second-rate NBN were receiving terrible service, with worse speeds than their previous ADSL connection. How can that be? A lot of people were saying they were willing to pay more if they got decent broadband, but they just couldn't get it. It is completely unfair and unreasonable that the government expects Australians to pay more for the NBN but get an inferior service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm regularly contacted by residents and businesses with story after story about being connected to the second-rate NBN. Tracey is a director at a local childcare centre. Since the centre has been connected to the NBN, the system fails weekly. Parents say that, if they call the childcare centre, often they can't get messages through because not only is the internet down but now the phone line is down, and that usually happens after there has been bad weather. This is the new, modern system that the Liberal Party brags about!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, another common theme was the blame-shifting that is constantly going on between NBN Co and providers. It's no wonder that this is happening, because the Prime Minister models this every single day: 'It's your telco's fault.' You contact NBN Co and they blame the provider. You contact the provider and they blame NBN Co. Stephen was assured he would be connected to the NBN, but after three weeks of no phone or internet connection he has become desperate. Last week his service provider finally sent out a technician to connect him, but he couldn't get it to work because NBN hadn't made a link to the node. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an example of the incompetence that we are seeing around this failed experiment of the NBN under the Liberals. There is only one way to deliver superfast broadband to this country. The Liberal Party has ignored that pathway to success. Instead, we are seeing Australians right around this country suffer as a result.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  It's my great pleasure to rise and speak in this adjournment debate. I want to begin my contribution by talking about the red ribbon that I am wearing, which is for the Daniel Morcombe Foundation. I want to pay credit to the foundation and its goal, which is all about educating children regarding their personal safety, including abduction. Daniel Morcombe, tragically, was abducted and murdered. The foundation is doing some incredible work. It's also focused on assisting victims of crime, remembering Daniel with suitable child safety community awareness events and supporting the families of missing persons, particularly when they are children. So I take my hat off to the Daniel Morcombe Foundation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to celebrate today the fabulous announcement of $10.1 million for local advanced manufacturers in the Corangamite electorate and the Geelong region under the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Fund. We had some fabulous news this week. In fact, the Geelong region secured one-third of the total grantsâ€”$30 millionâ€”that were announced for Victoria and South Australia. This is all about supporting manufacturing. Particularly in the wake of the closure of the car industry, our government is working extremely hard to support advanced manufacturing and of course manufacturing workers. We announced $100 million for advanced manufacturing in this year's budget and already we are delivering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm absolutely delighted that there are five funding recipients in the Geelong region. I want to talk a little about each of them because they all either are making an amazing contribution or have the potential to make an amazing contribution to manufacturing and jobs in our region. LeMond Composites has received $2.5 million to support the commissioning of Australia's first commercial carbon-fibre manufacturing facility. This is an absolute game changer. Greg LeMond, the founder of the company, was the winner of the Tour de France in 1986, riding the first carbon-fibre bike in the Tour de France. He then went on to form this company, which has entered into a $58 million licensing agreement with Deakin University. They are developing a unique process as part of that licensing agreement, which we hope will trigger this incredible new operation and manufacturing facility in Waurn Ponds, on the Deakin University innovation site. We are incredibly excited about the potential for LeMond Composites.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, $2.5 million has gone to Carbon Revolution, which, as we knowâ€”I have spoken previously about Carbon Revolutionâ€”employs 120 people making carbon-fibre wheels for the global auto market. It is an incredible advanced-manufacturing success story. Flat Glass Industries will receive $2.5 million to embed an advanced-manufacturing platform into its existing glass plant in Geelong and manufacture new value-added glass products. Boundary Bend Olives, Australia's largest olive farmer, olive oil producer and marketer of extra virgin olive oilâ€”principally under the Cobram Estate brandâ€”will receive $812,000 to develop its business to utilise waste by-products to produce high-value extracts for the cosmetic goods sector. Air-Radiators has received $1.85 million to assist the company to develop a new range of heat exchangers to support its engine-cooling solutions for high-horsepower diesel engines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the Geelong and Corangamite regions, we are seeing some incredible advanced-manufacturing success stories. We are very proud of the work that this government is doing to support advanced manufacturing. This builds on the very significant work that has already been done through the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, which has delivered some 890 local jobs, and the growth fund, which has also delivered many additional jobs to our region, and reflects our very strong focus on driving further innovation, skills and employment opportunities for the great people of Corangamite and our Geelong region.</span>
