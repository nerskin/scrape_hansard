                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is our duty as a government to ensure that all of these vessels operate as safely as possible so that they do not risk the lives of those onboard, while being efficient and productive to allow the owners and operators to get on with the job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, the Council of Australian Governments decided on a range of national productivity reforms. One such reform was to establish a national regulator for maritime safety—specifically focused on the safety of domestic commercial vessels. As a result the Australian Maritime Safety Authority was appointed as the national regulator. This was enabled through the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which made the states and the Northern Territory responsible for service delivery as delegates of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this law, the national system for domestic commercial vessel safety was designed to provide a single national regulatory framework to ensure the safe operation, design, construction and equipping of domestic commercial vessels, and to ensure operators, seafarers and vessels could move seamlessly between jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following an independent review of the national system in 2014, it was evident that there were inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the way it was being delivered. Inconsistent approaches between the state-based service delivery arrangements were identified as the key cause of the full benefits of the national system not being realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequently, the Council of Australian Governments' Transport and Infrastructure Council agreed the Australian Maritime Safety Authority would take over service delivery and, over time, achieve full cost recovery through the introduction of a levy for the national system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The levy is consistent with the Australian government's cost-recovery framework and will only recover costs for activities that are directly related to the safety of domestic commercial vessels. Safety regulation activities will include the:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the economic importance of these domestic commercial vessels and the safety of the crew and passengers onboard, the Commonwealth has committed $55 million to support industry to transition to charges under this levy. This is part of a $102.4 million joint transition funding package from the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory over 10 years from 1 July 2018. This transition package will help industry adjust to the change to national delivery of maritime safety regulation and ultimately achieve full cost recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2018, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will deliver a truly national system of domestic commercial vessel safety in accordance with the original vision of the Council of Australian Governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, no levy will be charged to industry in the first year of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's service delivery to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all operators as charging arrangements are standardised and services transition across Australia. Levy charges will then increase gradually to ensure industry has time to plan and adjust. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry organisations such as the Tasmanian Seafood Industry Council, the Western Australia Fishing Industry Council, the Boating Industry Association and the Northern Territory Seafood Council are supportive of this transition package which will help to ensure a smooth transition to a national regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national system for domestic commercial vessel safety will allow every domestic commercial vessel owner, operator or crew member in Australia to operate under one set of safety standards and charges, and experience a nationally consistent level of service. It will also reduce barriers for industry, improve labour force mobility, and simplify vessel transfers across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the benefits of a national system for domestic commercial vessel safety is that operators now only have to meet one set of requirements nationally, instead of in every state or territory they work across. Take Mr Bruce Davey, a commercial fisherman, for example, who runs a fishing operation and a charter operation during different times in the year across Queensland and the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He says that in the past he had to have two different certificates of survey, log books, and management plans. There was a time when he even flew Northern Territory surveyors across to Queensland to have his vessel surveyed because it was a lot cheaper than getting a surveyor in Queensland, but then Queensland no longer recognised the survey done by the surveyor from the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But now he says that 'having a national body with one set of rules has made an amazing difference'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His Australian Maritime Safety Authority accredited surveyor surveys his vessel by the book, and his certificate of survey is recognised in both Queensland and the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Maritime Safety Authority will deliver these services for around 30 per cent less than it currently costs to deliver the system. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is working hard to reduce the cost of the system without compromising safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will further improve Australia's economic growth, productivity and competitiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I present a package of three bills to introduce the cost-recovery levy for the national system for domestic commercial vessel safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first bill is the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) Levy Bill 2018, which will create an act to impose a levy on domestic commercial vessels, define the persons liable to pay this levy in respect of a leviable vessel, and allow the amount of levy to be set in rules.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1987, the Australian government introduced the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) as a voluntary, alternative national registration scheme for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes solely involved in interstate trade or commerce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">FIRS was a response to industry concerns about state and territory registration schemes that, at the time, deterred and restricted interstate road transport. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also designed to promote safer interstate trade and greater use of high-productivity vehicles through an exemption for FIRS registered vehicles from standard state and territory stamp duties for newly purchased vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, it provided a mechanism that made sure long-haul heavy vehicles made an appropriate contribution to road maintenance through their registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">FIRS represented the first comprehensive land transport strategy for this nation—a tangible, collective commitment to improve the transportation of freight across the country by addressing challenges arising from a lack of uniformity in state and territory registration schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the thirty years since FIRS's introduction, a lot has changed. Heavy vehicles have grown in size, and the national road freight task has nearly tripled in that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Articulated trucks now take on nearly 80 per cent of the freight task, with the use of B-double trucks, and with a notable shift by operators toward other higher productivity vehicles, such as road trains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of coordination between states and territories that resulted in a haphazard regulatory environment no longer exists, through ongoing efforts by jurisdictions to harmonise heavy vehicle arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Initiatives such as uniform registration charging agreements and increased ongoing communication between states and territories have made FIRS redundant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The numbers bear this out. The numbers of FIRS-registered vehicles have declined steadily for nearly a decade after peaking at nearly 22,000 vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As at 30 June 2017, there were 13,927 FIRS-registered vehicles (including trailers) in Australia, representing only 1.6 per cent of the Australian fleet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent modelling suggests that the size of the FIRS fleet will continue to fall, reducing to approximately one per cent of the total fleet by 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An independent program evaluation (known as the evaluation) in 2016 revealed the stamp duty exemption afforded by FIRS had not improved safety outcomes nor reduced fleet age, with industry figures showing the average fleet age to be around 14 years—a figure that has not reduced since the introduction of FIRS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Continuation of FIRS perpetuates an unfair situation where relatively few operators can access a financial benefit that around 98 per cent of heavy vehicle operators cannot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decline of FIRS registrations, combined with the evaluation report finding no evidence of FIRS achieving its policy objectives, supports the Australian government's conclusion that a tax exemption for a minority of operators is not sufficient reason to retain an ineffective regulatory program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transport companies today require the flexibility to adjust their operations to suit changing customer requirements and market opportunities. Consistent feedback from industry has highlighted that flexibility is essential to being competitive and responsive to market changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not possible for many small businesses in the road transport industry, where around 70 per cent of operators have only one vehicle, to take advantage of FIRS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that we protect Australian small businesses and remove policies that may impede the growth of a sector so crucial to preserving our standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">FIRS was established as one mechanism to provide funding for road maintenance, but this remains a challenge. The Australian government is pursuing reforms with states and territories through the Heavy Vehicle Road Reform mechanism, independent from FIRS, as this approach will be far more effective than the current reliance on FIRS' shrinking base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the first step in the delivery of a new system that better serves the needs of today's transport industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with the stance of Australian governments since 2009 and affirmed by the COAG Transport and Infrastructure Council in May 2017, this bill will progressively close FIRS and make way for the progress of national heavy vehicle reforms, beginning with a modern national registration system for heavy vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national registration system will be open to all operators in states and territories participating in the Heavy Vehicle National Law reforms, and is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2018. This bill seeks to facilitate this transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2018, existing FIRS operators will seamlessly move to the new registration system once their current FIRS registration period concludes, and will immediately be able to access benefits associated with the new system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Full closure will take place on 30 June 2019. Existing FIRS operators moving to the national registration system by this date will be eligible for a one-off stamp duty exemption, as well as immediate access to the benefits of the new system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has changed in the last 30 years. Our needs are different, our priorities have changed and our collective regulatory capabilities have also improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure of FIRS is the next logical step in moving Australia towards a more productive and effective heavy vehicle registration policy. I commend this bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is heavily reliant on international shipping. Ninety-nine per cent of our imports and exports by weight are carried by ships. Therefore, as a government, it is our duty to ensure that our laws for the prevention of marine pollution are adequate, up to date and consistent with international law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill I present today, the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, will ensure that the framework for preventing marine pollution is in line with international requirements. It will also allow for consistency between key pieces of legislation that implement our obligations domestically, and provide for the continued application of the protection of the sea levy legislation without unnecessary regulation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill primarily amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, known as the POTS Act. The POTS Act, together with the Navigation Act 2012<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>implement domestically our international obligations stemming from the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>(known as MARPOL) adopted at the International Maritime Organization, or IMO.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the POTS Act set out in this bill will implement Australia's international obligations to ensure that the master of a ship has vital information relating to relevant cargoes on board before discharging the residues of these cargoes. This will allow the master to discharge these residues appropriately, and only into the sea where it has been determined, and declared, that the cargo residues are not harmful to the marine environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's implementation of these amendments to MARPOL is consistent with our long­standing support for protection of the marine environment, and our active backing of, and participation in, the IMO. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes a machinery change to the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Act 1981. The amendment will remove the need for regulations to prescribe the manner in which a protection of the sea levy notice may be served in particular circumstances. This minor change will allow the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Regulations to be repealed, removing a dated and now unnecessary piece of regulation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, these amendments will ensure consistent and efficient legislation and that Australia continues to meet its international obligations. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  The purpose of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 is to introduce a new regulatory regime for administrators of financial benchmarks. This input includes providing ASIC, the regulator, with new supervisory powers, introducing a licensing regime for financial benchmark administrators and making manipulation of financial benchmarks an offence subject to civil penalties. It is something that Labor has been committed to for many, many years—strengthening our regulators and the laws and powers that they have to combat financial benchmark manipulation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over recent years, in particular the last decade, it's been an issue of significance in international financial markets. There have been a number of scandals and allegations in recent years around the manipulation of financial benchmarks by financial institutions. The most prominent and widespread of those was the case of the LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, the reference rate for about $300 billion of loans worldwide, which implicated a number of major international banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we haven't been immune to this phenomenon, with cases actually going on at the moment. They have been taken by ASIC predominantly against the big four banks in respect of manipulation of the bank bill swap rate. There were actions taken against the NAB and ANZ; those actions have been settled by the parties. Westpac chose to fight the litigation, and the litigation has recently proceeded in the Federal Court, and we're awaiting a decision on that. Now the Commonwealth Bank, CBA, has been dragged into this as well, with allegations of bank bill swap rate manipulation against its traders now being made by ASIC, and no doubt that will potentially lead to further litigation against the CBA into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC's noted that manipulation of the bank bill swap rate is not a victimless act. There are implications for Australian businesses by affecting financial products that they use to manage their financial affairs, and the losses to those victims are potentially in the hundreds of millions of dollars. That's why it's important that the regulations are strong enough to combat and deter these activities and, indeed, that our regulators, most notably ASIC, have the powers to investigate, prosecute and deal with people alleged to have undertaken manipulation of financial derivatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill makes amendments to the Corporations Act to strengthen protections against manipulation of financial benchmarks. Currently, rules against manipulation of financial benchmarks are enforced using existing laws relating to market manipulation, false trading and market rigging. Schedule 1 will make manipulation of financial products used in an Australian context a specific criminal offence and subject to civil penalties. It will also establish a new licensing regime requiring administrators of certain designated financial benchmarks to obtain a new benchmark administrator licence from ASIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you give the regulator these new powers, you must supply it with the resources to police them. It's no secret that this government has been woefully incompetent when it comes to ensuring that ASIC has the necessary powers and resources to do its job and to police such activity in financial markets. This government slashed ASIC's funding by $120 million in the 2014 budget, and of course that resulted in job losses. ASIC admitted as much to inquiries of the House and Senate economics committees—that there were job losses associated with this cut to its funding. Given the problems that we've had in Australia in financial regulation and in financial services, particularly in wealth management and insurance and predominantly around the big four banks, you'd think it would be completely the wrong approach for a government to be cutting the resources of the body that's tasked with policing what's been going on in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When those cuts were made, the Labor Party opposed them strongly. Despite the depth of the cuts and the massive impact that the government took to unwind those cuts, it unfortunately took all of the scandals being uncovered in the banking industry—the scandals uncovered through a number of Senate inquiries, as well as the wealth management scandal at the Commonwealth Bank and the CommInsure scandal, again with the Commonwealth Bank—for all of the big four banks to have to review their wealth management practices and back-pay hundreds of millions of dollars to clients who'd been wronged in the scandals. In recent times, the Commonwealth Bank has been prosecuted by AUSTRAC for potential or alleged breaches of Australia's anti-money-laundering and terrorism financing laws. You need to arm the regulator, the body responsible for making sure that bad decisions aren't made and that people don't lose money in the financial markets in Australia. You need to give them the resources to do that, and those cuts have had an effect. It was only when these issues were highlighted and Labor started calling for a royal commission into banking and financial services that the government backed down and returned some of that money to ASIC, but, in many respects, the damage had been done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On broader financial management issues, it's well known that Labor has led the way when it comes to ensuring that our laws are up to date with some of the challenges and risks associated with consumer credit, financial market regulation, and ensuring that financial planners and banking industry and insurance industry representatives are operating in the best interests of their customers. It was Labor that introduced reforms such as the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, which introduced the first single standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that the government also opposed Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms when they were initially proposed by the previous Labor government. These, of course, were the reforms that introduced a best interest test for the giving of financial advice by financial planners in Australia. The reforms introduced a licensing regime, ensured that a staged test had to be undertaken by financial planners before they could offer advice and removed a lot of the trailing commissions that had existed in some of these products and how they were sold. These reforms came on the back of scandals like Trio Capital and Storm Financial, where hundreds of Australians lost millions and millions of dollars, their life savings, because of financial scams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor introduced those reforms, the coalition members, kicking and screaming, said that they were intrusive, that it was overregulation and that they weren't necessary. Then, of course, we got the scandals, we got the rip-offs in the banking sector and we got the calls for a royal commission—which, by the way, came out of a bipartisan committee report from the Senate where members of the National Party initially supported the call for a royal commission into banking and financial services. What did the Abbott and Turnbull governments do? They resisted it. They resisted that call for 600 days. For 600 days, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said there was no need for a royal commission into banking and financial services, despite the evidence from numerous inquiries and committees. I think at one stage there were 21 inquiries into banking and financial services in this country, in a parliamentary sense, in a regulator sense and in an industry sense. They were all uncovering all the problems that existed in wealth management, in insurance and in banking generally, but the government chose to do nothing about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the CEOs of the big four banks got together and wrote a letter to the Prime Minister that said: 'Look, we're getting reputational damage from the calls for a royal commission to look at all these scandals that keep coming up. We'll now agree to a royal commission.' What did the Prime Minister do the next day? He did a massive backflip, and suddenly the coalition were offering a royal commission. The royal commission, thankfully, has begun proceedings this week. We support what's going on there and we eagerly await the outcomes of their interim report in September and their final report later on. Labor listened to the victims, the customers, the clients and, importantly, the workers who work in these industries, about the shortcomings and had been calling for a royal commission for two years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also give ASIC the power to compel market participants to make submissions to ensure the continued generation of financial benchmarks during times of financial market stress. This is known as the power of last resort. The ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill supports this regime by adding benchmark administrator licences to the list of entities from which ASIC may recover its regulatory costs under the ASIC supervisory cost recovery levy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The related bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017, also facilitates the Productivity Commission appointing an additional commissioner with extensive experience in dealing with Indigenous policy areas and Indigenous communities to oversee the PC's work in evaluating Indigenous policies and programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor remains concerned about the definition that this government is adopting of an Indigenous person, which is based on race and descent, rather than on the standard definition based on a three-part definition of descent, identification and acceptance in a community. Labor has argued for some time now and in the Senate multiculturalism report that it is necessary to move away from a race based terminology in legislation and policy. That is something that we hope to see the government adopt. Labor stands with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to recommit to delivering them a greater say in issues affecting their lives. This is a big issue that has been identified in this report coming on the back of that Productivity Commission, and it's something that Labor says is very, very serious. We'll work with Aboriginal communities to adjust, and we call on the government to do a similar thing. Based on those comments, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 and the related bill will strengthen protections against manipulation of financial benchmarks and provide for the appointment of a productivity commissioner with extensive skills and experience in dealing with policies and programs that will have an impact on Indigenous persons. Labor largely supports these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While some benchmarks are calculated by the administrator using regulated and publicly available data, others rely on submissions from banks and other market participants. Examples of these include the London interbank offered rate—commonly known as LIBOR—and Australia's bank bill swap rate, the Standard &amp; Poor's ASX 200 index, the ASX bond features settlement price, the cash rate and the consumer price index. If we look at these sorts of benchmarks, globally there have been many cases of market misconduct regarding their determination. As of August last year, penalties paid by financial institutions in relation to such manipulation had reached around A$25 billion. In Australia, ASIC commenced formal court proceedings in 2016 against the ANZ, NAB and Westpac for alleged market manipulation and unconscionable conduct in relation to the bank bill swap rate. Later, ASIC expanded the rate-rigging case to also include the Commonwealth Bank. These cases continue to proceed now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the bank bill swap rate is to provide an independent and transparent reference rate for the pricing and revaluation of Australian dollar derivatives and securities. It's an important benchmark because it impacts financial products used by many Australian businesses to manage their financial affairs, in particular their borrowings. Artificially moving the bank bill swap rate can have some very clear winners—often the banks—and plenty of victims, the Australian business community. So rate-rigging is a serious crime—well, at least it should be. In fact, it already is. The Corporations Act already criminalises market manipulation and misleading or deceptive conduct. But, as I can tell you, as a former prosecutor that specialised in corporate crime, the existing provisions are very difficult to prosecute. They are complex. So new and, in particular, clearer laws in this area are well overdue. Indeed, given how long ago the manipulations of the LIBOR and the BBSW were, it is concerning that it has taken the government so long to get around to fixing these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, the coalition made massive cuts to ASIC's capability as the corporate regulator—a massive free pass for corporate misconduct. The government only moved to restore that funding when Labor called for a banking royal commission. So I'm glad that ASIC is finally getting some positive attention from this government, a government that appeared to play favourites with its financial regulators, favouring APRA in many cases even where ASIC would be the more appropriate regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what will these laws specifically do? Schedule 1 will establish a new licensing regime, requiring administrators of designated significant financial benchmarks to obtain a new benchmark administrator licence from ASIC. ASIC will have the power to designate significant financial benchmarks, subject to one or more specified criteria being met. It will also give ASIC power to make rules imposing a regulatory framework for licensed benchmark administrators and related matters. This framework will reflect a set of principles released by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, IOSCO. And it will make manipulation of these financial benchmarks a criminal offence and subject to civil penalties with appropriate penalties attached. In addition, the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill adds benchmark administrator licensees to the list of entities from which ASIC may recover its regulatory costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we welcome these bills, we are not blind to the Turnbull government's poor record on consumer protection in financial services. In the face of growing misconduct by the big banks and mounting consumer discontent, this government refused to establish a banking royal commission. While the banks eventually saw the writing on the wall and had to come and ask the government for a royal commission, it just goes to show where the loyalties of this government lie—with the banks and not the Australian people. The banks, indeed, wrote the terms of reference almost entirely themselves. This is, I think one can admit, a clayton's banking royal commission. It's the sort of royal commission you have when you're not having a royal commission. And, as we have seen, the timing allowed for this royal commission is woefully inadequate. The scope is broad but specifically excluding dealing with the regulatory regime in which banks operate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this can be contrasted against, of course, is Labor's record in managing financial services and, in particular, protecting consumers. It was the previous Labor government that made landmark reforms like the introduction of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act in 2009. This was the first single, standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight. It gave oversight to consumer credit, including home loans and credit cards, to the national regulator, ASIC. It included what are proving to be some very important and responsible lending obligations. We should also not forget Labor's enactment of the Future of Financial Advice reforms, the FOFA reforms, which the coalition indeed voted against. ASIC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Fees for no service</span> report recently revealed that the big four banks and AMP had spent years taking fees from customers for financial advice services that in fact they never provided. A number of financial advisers engaged by the big banks were also charged for giving dodgy financial advice to consumers. The coalition's opposition to FOFA now looks incredibly embarrassing, and they should indeed be embarrassed by it. ASIC has stated that FOFA requirements that were passionately opposed by those opposite helped to bring to light the massive fees-for-no-service scandal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to schedule 2 of the legislation, it provides for the appointment of a productivity commissioner with experience and expertise working in Indigenous communities and with Indigenous people to oversee the work of the Productivity Commission in relation to the evaluation of policies and programs that have an impact on Indigenous persons. Labor stands with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to recommit to delivering a greater say in issues that affect their lives, such as this. However, there are factors in this bill that we have concern with. The definition of 'Indigenous person' is based on race and descent rather than the more standard definition, which is based on a three-part test of descent, identification and acceptance in the community. Labor has argued in the Senate multiculturalism report that it was necessary to move away from a race based terminology in legislation and policy. Labor will conduct further consultation in respect of schedule 2 in relation to this language and the definition in the bill and the issue of the new productivity commissioner being a non-identified person. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of the term 'race' has the capacity to reinforce negative perceptions of others from different cultures. The descent, identification, acceptance definition has been adopted by all Commonwealth agencies, which raises the question: why hasn't it been used in this legislation? In a multicultural society such as ours, terms like 'race' serve only to divide. I can think of another document where the term 'race' is also used quite liberally, the Australian Constitution. The Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples actually proposed the removal of sections 51(xxvi) and 25 of the Constitution because of their reliance upon race as an 18th century concept and the embedded racist thinking that governs their construction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is the term being used here? This government likes the Constitution just the way it is, which is why, of course, it also rejected the Uluru statement. The voice to parliament, constitutional or legislated, was widely regarded as a modest change. Instead of a judicially enforced mere prohibition on racial discrimination, the body would be designed to provide active participation in the democratic life of the state. Although Indigenous people enjoy full equality in the electoral arena, their position as an extreme numerical minority makes it difficult for them to be heard by government, all the while holding a unique place in our society and history as this land's first inhabitants and its custodians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a media statement, the government said a referendum on a voice to parliament would have 'absolutely zero chance of success'. How do they know this? The Minister for Indigenous Affairs' explanation was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I don't need evidence ... we have done a lot of polling, not on this particular … matter, but on other matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, that makes complete sense, apparently. I am glad that the government are proposing to have an Indigenous voice within the Productivity Commission, but they do need to get it right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to make some notes to the drafters. What is with these opaque and misleading legislative titles? Firstly, there are not one but two measures in this bill. At the very least, it would have made far more sense to have called this bill 'Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5 and No. 6)'. But really, and I say this on behalf of every law student in the country, if not for others who struggle to understand our legal system: could you not have had two amendment bills: the 'Corporations Amendment Benchmark Regulation Bill' and the 'Productivity Commission Indigenous Commissioner Bill'? That would have made much more sense. We talk often about transparency and accountability in government. Maybe we could take just one small step in that direction in the way that we label our legislation. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  It is really a pleasure to be here to speak in respect of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 and the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017. I do note the member for Burt's criticisms of the naming of the bills, and I agree with him that it is important to be transparent about exactly what we're debating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having made those remarks, I would like to talk about the contents of the bills and to specifically go to just a few issues in respect of each of the substantive parts of the legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission plays an incredibly important role in the context of our economy, as Australia's markets, corporate and financial services regulator. I have to say that there is a lot of scepticism out there about whether or not it's even possible in our system, given the power that banks have, for a regulator to do anything to affect their conduct or to hold them to account. We certainly would say on our side that it is important that there be a banking royal commission and that it be a genuine banking royal commission that will look at holding these industry participants to account. I note that the government has instituted its own royal commission, after being dragged kicking and screaming to doing so. It took a long time for the government to acknowledge even the possibility of having a royal commission. Labor has made some criticisms of the conditions under which the royal commission has been established, and I won't repeat them here. But suffice it to say our nation is in need of some good, strong scrutiny into the practices of Australia's banks. It is taking a royal commission to do that. At the same time, there needs to be an ongoing strong regulator that can be Australia's financial services regulator, that can hold the banks to account and, most importantly, that can enforce Australia's laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, because of the interest that you take in financial services matters, that there has been some recent litigation brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in respect of manipulation of the bank bill swap rate against Australia's four big banks. Two of those proceedings have settled, with each of the two settling banks paying tens of millions of dollars in fines as a consequence of their conduct in respect of the bank bill swap rate. One did not settle, but it has concluded in terms of hearings and a decision is awaited. The fourth, in relation to the Commonwealth, has really only just kicked off. We've only just this week seen the detailed allegations being made against the Commonwealth Bank in that case. I'm sure we will all be following it with great interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to reflect on what we expect of a regulator like ASIC when it comes to litigation. This is a point that I raised with the new chair, James Shipton, and I might use this opportunity to welcome him to the chairmanship of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. He is filling big shoes. I do hope he will take a very, very robust approach to enforcement of the law and to consumer protection and making sure that ASIC's responsibilities in respect of consumer protection are discharged. I put to him quite recently in a committee hearing that there are some thorny issues for ASIC in terms of how they go when they prosecute companies, particularly banks, or bring civil proceedings against them. That is this: if they win all their cases, does that show they are successful and invincible as a regulator? The concept of apparent regulatory invincibility is an important one. Market participants need to feel that if there are proceedings pursued against them they are likely to cause real difficulty in the event that the participant has engaged in unlawful conduct. Or does a high success rate mean that the regulator is pursuing only the easy cases and not the hard cases? In other words, a high success rate can be interpreted in very different ways when it comes to litigation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case, I think we can be confident that these cases that ASIC is bringing in respect of the manipulation of the bank bill swap rate would not be considered to be easy cases. We will wait and see what outcomes arise once the courts hand down their decisions, particularly in respect of the matter that has concluded its hearings but hasn't yet been finalised and in respect of the new Commonwealth Bank matter, the other two having settled. But we should be wary and cautious, whatever the outcome, that we do not inadvertently, by our responses, put pressure on the regulator to stop bringing hard cases and to stop taking on issues that are complex and involve breaches of different aspects of the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, the existing provisions that ASIC is using to pursue these particular cases in respect of financial benchmarks manipulation are important but clearly insufficient in terms of future work in this area. So it's quite pleasing that this bill is bringing forward additional regulation and the establishment of criminal offences in respect of financial benchmarks manipulation. The bill will make manipulation of all financial benchmarks used in Australia a specific criminal offence as well as being subject to civil penalties. Individuals will be liable to fines of up to the greater of three times the benefit they gain or $945,000, which is 4,500 penalty units. Of course penalty units continue to grow as they are adjusted. A body corporate, on the other hand, will be liable to fines of up to the greater of $9.45 million—which is 45,000 penalty units—three times any benefits from the manipulation, or 10 per cent of the entity's turnover in the previous year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are meaningful penalties. That's what we need in this country. We do need there to be a big stick in the wings so that there are incentives for industry participants to conduct themselves according to the law. Often the existence of these provisions is enough to deter unlawful conduct. I'm certainly not saying that ASIC should be doing nothing but bringing legal proceedings. Of course they need to have a multidimensional and multifaceted approach to encouraging willing compliance, seeking undertakings, seeking civil remedies where appropriate and ultimately being able to seek criminal penalties as well. That's a hierarchy of different approaches to the regulation of industry, and it's a judgement call as to which part of that hierarchy should be used at any one time. I certainly don't mean to suggest that there should be nothing but criminal prosecutions. Having said that, the availability of criminal prosecutions is crucial to ensure that there are incentives in both senses—both positive and adverse incentives—for the industry participants to comply with the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The manipulation of financial benchmarks has real life consequences for people—for people sitting around the household table, for people in their businesses trying to work out what to invest. If there's manipulation of benchmarks then that can put up the cost of borrowing and that can damage the confidence that our society has in our financial markets and in financial services provision. Of course, anything that damages confidence makes investment more difficult, makes loan decisions more difficult and makes economic activity more difficult. So it is important that, in seeking to maintain confidence and regulation of our financial services sector, these criminal offences are introduced and there are strong laws incentivising good behaviour in the financial services sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill will establish a new licensing regime requiring administrators of certain designated significant financial benchmarks to obtain a new benchmark administrator licence from ASIC. Again this regulation will assist in promoting confidence in the financial services sector, so I welcome it. These bills also go to the supervisory cost recovery levy. Deputy Speaker, you'll recall that the new supervisory cost recovery levy was introduced last year and started taking effect from 1 July 2017. The government introduced a user-pays model, where those being regulated make a contribution to the cost of regulating them. The formulae that have been set up are aimed at allocating the costs to those who require the most regulation, so it's a complex set of formulae.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we spoke about this move to having the industry pay for the operations of ASIC we noted that that might give some opportunities in respect of some of ASIC's other work. I specifically want to mention the shadow minister's speech of 15 June 2017. She did note the complexity in the way that the industry cost model has been created and indicated that we would be watching that closely, which remains the case. We also accept that it's important that ASIC be properly resourced so that it can be a good, strong law enforcement focused regulator. Of course, the government's own conduct hasn't always been consistent in sending that message to ASIC. You'll recall the $120 million cut to ASIC in the 2014 budget. I spoke against that particular component of the 2014 budget at the time. I thought it was reckless to take away funding from one of our important white-collar crime regulators. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who's read the 2014 statement of expectations of the government towards ASIC would find it fairly light on when it comes to consumer protection. There's a lot of quite warm language in there about encouraging compliance, but you don't see from this government a really full-voiced robust demand that the regulator really focus on consumer protection. I hope that will be taken into account when the government drafts the next statement of expectations for ASIC, in the event that there is another one coming down the pipeline now that there is a new chair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister also in her speech on the original ASIC industry cost-recovery legislation noted that, as part of the government's process of developing that bill, there had been submissions calling for additional funding for financial counselling services, including from Financial Counselling Australia and the consumer group CHOICE. The shadow minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the importance of financial counsellors to those in financial trouble, and their importance to the functioning of the financial sector, we think that these issues warrant further consideration from the Government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do hope that the government has taken that on board. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My interest in financial counselling, apart from the general interest that anyone in this place would have, arises from my role as the shadow assistant minister for preventing family violence. That is because there is an important need for financial counselling for women leaving violent relationships. It's a time of great risk of poverty and, accordingly, it is important to note that the shadow minister, in addressing the previous bill, talked about the arguments that had been made in the context of the industry funding model that there should be consideration given as to how that might support further or better resourcing for financial counselling in this country. I make no further comment on that other than to draw the attention of the House to those remarks that the shadow minister made at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of this bill that can't really go without comment is the Productivity Commission reform. This reform will, or is at least intended to, set up a regime with a view to ensuring that Indigenous perspectives are included in the Productivity Commission's consideration of policy measures. There has been, I think, a lot of concern raised about the definition of Indigeneity contained in this legislation. I hope that the government will take on board the criticisms that have been made. We do not need to go backwards in the way that we recognise Indigeneity in this nation. We don't need, in something that's purportedly designed to improve outcomes for Indigenous people, to inflict upon them old-fashioned and outdated thinking in respect of definitions of Indigeneity, and I certainly hope that this is a matter that will be able to resolved by consent, once this legislation heads to the Senate. I'm sure that the member for Lingiari, who will be speaking in respect of this legislation soon, will have many more things to say about the definition of Indigeneity in the legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to say in the context of this that I acknowledge that the Turnbull government is seeking to create in the Productivity Commission a specific focus on the impact of policies that are created purportedly for the benefit of Indigenous people. But it's another thing altogether to actually listen to Indigenous people themselves through a mechanism that provides them with a real voice to parliament as was anticipated by the Uluru Statement from the Heart. I call on the Prime Minister to rethink his opposition to supporting the Uluru Statement from the Heart. I hope that he will listen to Indigenous people and make good on his commitment to do things with people, not to them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SNOWDON:</span>
                    </a>  Lovingly peaceful, as we all are! I just want to remind the House that this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill, contains two schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Corporations Act 2001 to introduce a new regulatory regime for administrators of financial benchmarks, and schedule 2 amends the Productivity Commission Act to enable the appointment of an additional commissioner with Indigenous policy responsibility. Schedule 1 of the Treasury laws amendment bill contains three parts. I won't go through them, and I won't comment in detail on the bill. That's been done with a great deal of aplomb by the member for Griffith previously and by the shadow minister sitting at the table, the member for Fenner, who knows far more about these matters than I do, I have to say. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I did want to just in passing make the comment, given that we're talking about Treasury here, that yesterday we saw in the Northern Territory an announcement by the Territory government that it was unveiling a response to a wide-ranging alcohol review commissioned by the former NT Supreme Court Chief Justice Trevor Riley. It announced very courageously, in my view, and very importantly that it would introduce a floor price on alcohol. It will be $1.30. It won't affect the price of beer, but it will make a great deal of difference to cheap wine and mean that wine costing less than a bottle of water will effectively no longer be available and certainly not available at $3 or $4 or $5; that bottle of wine will now be $9 or $10. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important that we understand what motivated this. This is to deal with the problem drinking of alcohol by some residents of the Northern Territory, and it's in concert with the demands of the Public Health Association of Australia for us to address broadly, across this country, issues to do with alcohol consumption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues often raised is the strength of the argument for the Commonwealth government to take action in this regard as well and introduce a volumetric tax on alcohol. I'm a great advocate for that. I know that I'm at odds with some in my own party but I think it's extremely important as a public health measure that this government—or the next Labor government if this government doesn't do it—has the guts, courage, strength and commitment to the Australian community to introduce a volumetric tax on alcohol. This is an issue that has been at the front of my mind for almost two decades. I have not stopped arguing for it, and I will not stop arguing for it until it is in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the Northern Territory government. They often wear brickbats, but they deserve a giant bouquet for the measures they announced yesterday to deal with the abuse of alcohol in the Northern Territory. Last week and the week before, we saw tragic episodes around Tennant Creek publicised for the nation to see. I hope the nation understands that the measures announced yesterday by the Northern Territory government will have a significant impact upon the amount of alcohol consumed by those people identified in the press over recent weeks. I commend the Northern Territory government for its courage. In particular, I commend the Northern Territory minister responsible for this, Natasha Fyles, for the work that she has been doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the government that we do have an opportunity in this place to address issues without interventions of the type we have seen previously in the Northern Territory but by considered and coherent policy development in partnership with the Northern Territory government. In this case, in the context of alcohol, with the broader Australian community in mind, we need to understand that public health experts in this country have for a long time been advocating a volumetric tax on alcohol. We should understand the importance of that argument. We hear the alcohol industry say it is 'death by a thousand cuts' and 'the end of the world'. The problem is that we have a huge public health problem in this country around alcohol consumption and we need to address it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over recent years, we have seen the emergence of arguments about FASD. If the broader Australian community doesn't appreciate the impact of alcohol abuse on the fetus and on the development of young children then it needs to. We need to ensure that all measures are properly taken to address alcohol education, the abuse of alcohol and the consumption of alcohol. In the context of FASD, we need to get pregnant women not to drink; that would be a great start, because that is how it happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having dealt with the first aspect of the legislation, I will now go to the second aspect, which is the Productivity Commission. We support the inclusion of a productivity commissioner with expertise and a remit on policy matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but it raises an issue which is worth discussing. We have heard the Prime Minister lambasting the idea of an Indigenous voice in this parliament. He says he would not support under any circumstances the idea of an Indigenous voice being legislated, let alone being considered as part of constitutional reform. He wants to make it an issue at the forthcoming federal election, whenever that might be—this year or next year. You might ask: what dimwit would have that view, and why would he have it? Well, he has it because he sees it as a point of division, and the dog whistling that he's doing around it does him and his government no credit. Australians across this country deserve better than we're getting from this Prime Minister in relation to advancing the cause of discussion around the developments from the Uluru Statement from the Heart, including proper consideration of a voice and what a voice might look like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's in that context that we're considering this legislation about the Productivity Commission. I want to make this observation. The Prime Minister's not here, but let's imagine he is. Prime Minister, do you recall ATSIC? The Prime Minister presumably will say, 'Yes, I recall ATSIC.' Do you recall that it was an elected body elected by only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? 'Yes, I do.' Do you recall that it was set up by legislation by this federal parliament? 'Yes, I do.' Did you see it as anathema then? 'No, I didn't.' So why is it anathema now? Absurd!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just take the Prime Minister's mind a bit away from the dog whistling and talk about the potential for such a structure and what it may or may not look like. Again, you might say it could be a regional structure that might have regional representatives elected to a central body, which would elect the chair of something, whatever it's called—the ATSI Voice, for the purpose of this discussion. Why would you not give it functions like those that we're giving the Productivity Commission today? Why would you not? Would there be a difficulty with that? No. I would think not. You're setting up a body that would report to the parliament, and you give it powers. One of the powers you could give it would be the role you're giving the Productivity Commission today through this legislation. Why wouldn't you? Well, you should. You should contemplate it at least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, imagining the Prime Minister sitting opposite me, I say: Prime Minister, will you recant and understand the opportunity and the possibilities that present themselves from setting up a voice of that description, a body which is an advisory body to parliament and which may have some deliberative functions, legislated for by this parliament—a body whose purposes are decided by this parliament? Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm sure even you can contemplate that—no, I beg your pardon. I know you can contemplate that.</span>
                </p>

                    </a>  I don't want to reflect badly upon you. But it appears that the Prime Minister is incapable of doing it. That is simply sad. It is sad. Why wouldn't you come to the party and say, 'Let's have a proper discussion around the community without the dog whistling and see what might emerge as a result of discussion, whether it's a body of the type I've described or something different'? Why wouldn't you do it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're setting up a joint parliamentary committee which has terms of reference which, I understand, include the possibility of the consideration of a voice. Imagining the Prime Minister sitting opposite me, I say: can you and have you put aside your inane description of a voice and your dog whistling, and will you consider in a temperate way the recommendations that might come from a joint parliamentary committee without prejudging the outcomes? I can imagine him sitting there thinking to himself: 'Oh, what do I do here? We're setting up a parliamentary committee which I've agreed to. I've already said that I don't want an outcome that says there'll be a voice, but the terms of reference for this joint parliamentary committee will have the voice in them. What am I to do?' Well, Prime Minister, get off your bloody high horse and accept the proposition that it's a valid thing to do to go and consult with the people of Australia around a voice and what a voice might look like, to come back and make recommendations to the parliament, and to endorse the recommendations made to the parliament by a properly constituted committee of the parliament. I think that should be something even this Prime Minister should be able to understand. I know that he referred to my friend Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, as a bush lawyer. I'm not sure how to describe the Prime Minister. He's not even a bush lawyer, really, even though he's a QC. I suspect he thinks he's very good, but he's not that flash. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the issue which is of importance to us here in the Labor Party around the way this legislation seeks to define an Indigenous person. We've heard the shadow minister give a very good speech in this regard, relaying why it's important that we deal with this question. We are very much of the view that we should not be using a race based definition. We are very much of the view that we should be using the administrative definition that has so long been used across this country, even by government agencies today. That is: an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin and who is accepted as such by the community with which that person associates. It's very simple. It should not be an issue. It should not be a question which is exercising the minds of the government. They should see the merits of what has been proposed by the Labor Party. They should agree to these propositions. They should understand that it's within their province to be able to amend the legislation. We will be proposing an amendment in the Senate. We will look forward to the government accepting that amendment and saying to the Australian people, 'We think we should be following the administrative definition and not a definition based on race.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I rise to join with my colleagues in making comments about the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 and ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017. I completely endorse the comment made by the shadow minister and by my colleagues who have spoken in the debate so far. I've listened carefully to what they have had to say and I completely endorse their comments. In particular, I have just listened at length to the member for Lingiari and his comments around the actions of the Prime Minister and the importance of a first nation voice in this parliament and the reasons why it should happen. I completely endorse what he has said. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister has outlined clearly what Labor's position is on this piece of legislation. As we have said, we will support this bill in the House but reserve our right to put forward amendments in the other place. We do not have any issue with schedule 1 of the Treasury laws amendment bill. I think that that has been outlined clearly. But, as Labor speakers have clearly outlined, our issue is with schedule 2 of the bill. Schedule 2 goes to some extremely important, straightforward issues that I thought had been resolved. For some reason I understand that the Prime Minister's office has decided to take issue with what has been, as the member for Lingiari said, the administrative definition of Aboriginality that has existed since the 1980s within the Commonwealth, in state instrumentalities, in Aboriginal organisations and also in many instrumentalities, including universities, across this country. I know this because I have been involved in these discussions, particularly with land councils in New South Wales that have the responsibility of providing certificates of Aboriginality. I can assure the advisers in the box and I can assure the government that those certificates of Aboriginality, which are often required by government, are based on the administrative definition—that is, the three-part definition that my colleagues have spoken about. That three-part definition is: (a) that you are of Aboriginal descent; (b) that you identify as an Aboriginal person—in a sense, self-identification; and (c) most importantly—and what's been left out of this, incredibly, and, I understand, accepted by the Treasurer's office and not by the Prime Minister's office—that you're accepted as an Indigenous person by the Aboriginal community. In a moment, I will explain why that third part is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of background, schedule 2 provides for the appointment to the Productivity Commission of a commissioner who possesses extensive skills and experience in assessing policies and programs that have a particular impact on first nations people. This proposed commissioner would review the decisions and actions of government, non-government and private sector policies and programs. So it is an incredibly important position. It not only will review and evaluate initiatives or measures that specifically target first nations Australians but also would assess those which, while not necessarily designed to affect first nations Australians, affect first nations Australians nevertheless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be asking what is working and what isn't. Moreover, this proposed commissioner would have experience in dealing with one or more communities of first nations peoples. The schedule will increase the maximum number of commissioners, not including the commission chair, from 11 to 12. That's all by way of background, but let me go to the heart of why the definition that's being used is race based, which is one of the arguments why there should be changes to the Australian Constitution—which, in this day and age, has race based definitions in it. But I will leave that aside for a discussion for another day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does support the inclusion of a productivity commissioner with the expertise and role that I have already outlined. As the explanatory memorandum to this bill and this schedule acknowledges, there is a clear and established need for greater evaluation of the impact that policies, programs and initiatives have on first nations people. I have served in other parliaments, I have been the director-general of a government agency and I've run non-government organisations. I have followed very intimately the reports of the Productivity Commission and I understand very clearly the impacts those reports have in terms of describing what the situation is for first nations people and others, but also, of course, the way in which those issues are used for governments to set agendas, to set targets and set policies. So we understand the importance of that position, and I'm sure the member for Fenner would agree with me.</span>

                    </a>  But the remarkably stupid thing—if I can pick up on the comments from other speakers—is that the definition being used is a race based definition. Schedule 2 defines an Indigenous person as a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia or a descendant of an Indigenous inhabitant of the Torres Strait Islands. This is so far removed from the accepted definition that has been around, as I said, from the 1980s and which is used by universities, government agencies, the Commonwealth, the Aboriginal community and, in particular, land councils to provide certificates of Aboriginality. So there is quite a serious edge to this, and I want to make sure that people understand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another problem that we have with this definition is its preoccupation with race and descent. Labor notes that the most widely accepted definition is about descent, identification and acceptance. This is also internationally accepted. I have participated, as other members have as well, in forums within the United Nations specifically to do with first nations people, and this is the definition that is used. That makes this one of the most ridiculous arguments I think I've heard in this place. There should be no issue at all with the government accepting its own definition. Why it's digging its heels in about this suggests to me nothing other than wedge politics and a waste of people's time. Maybe there is nothing else the government has time to spend time on. Oh, that's right—drug testing! We'll talk about that down the track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition defines an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander as a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as being from Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin and who is accepted by the community. The member for Jagajaga's in the chamber. If there's anyone in this place, along with the member for Lingiari, who understands the importance of this, it's the member for Jagajaga. One of the things that very much engage the discussion is people who claim Aboriginality but are not accepted by the community and, in fact, in some cases, are not Aboriginal people. That is why that third part of this definition is so important—that the person is recognised by the community as someone of first nations descent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not trying to make problems here. We're trying to fix up a potential problem that the government is making for itself that it actually doesn't have to have. There's absolutely no controversy about this. I think the wise thing for the government to do would be to take a breath and, particularly for the men and women sitting in the advisers' box, to listen to what we're saying. I don't want to have a fight about this. It shouldn't be a fight. It is the accepted definition. So just go back and fix it up—it's really easy—and you'll have no problem from the Labor Party in relation to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus on and preoccupation with race and biology is particularly backwards, and I think other people have outlined that. The old view of how we thought about multiculturalism and social inclusion is reflected in this race based definition. It is not reflected in what everyone in this chamber who has an interest in this believes. If I said to most people in this chamber, 'Tell me what the definition of Aboriginality is,' they would tell me the three-part definition. They wouldn't tell me the two parts that are part of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The race powers featured in sections 51(xxvi) and 25 of the Constitution are reflected here, and the so-called race powers are underpinned by strong racial connotations. That is another consideration that I would like people to think about. This is taking us backwards 40 years, and there is just absolutely no need for it. I really urge the government to reconsider its definition and to consider what the conventional definition is when we proceed with our detailed amendments to the Senate. I cannot see what the problem with that is. There would be no fallout at all if the government has a look at that and redefines what it's actually putting forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other members have talked about the Indigenous space, the first nations space, that we seem to be moving into policy-wise in relation to the Commonwealth. I hear other members reiterating in this debate the principles of self-determination and the principles of first nations people choosing for ourselves and also, in relation to working with this parliament, having a voice to the parliament. The idea of bipartisanship and trying to preserve that notion of bipartisanship is being sorely tested by the government, and that is a dangerous space for us to be getting into in 2018. It is not something I have ever contemplated in the 40 years that I have been involved in Aboriginal affairs—that there would not be a bipartisan approach to looking at the issues facing the most disadvantaged group of people within our community.  Aboriginal people are saying: 'Come walk with us. We want to share what is an amazing story, and it is everyone's inheritance of 60,000 years. It is something we should be celebrating.' If we don't have bipartisanship, if we don't have an agreed way forward, then they are the things that are at stake. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The losers will not be people in this chamber. The losers will be people out in the broader community, and, more specifically, in the Indigenous community. So, in light of schedule 2, we ask the government to take the step towards giving bipartisan support to the voice in the parliament, but also bipartisan support to what is the conventional, administrative and accepted definition of Aboriginality. It just seems remarkable to me that we're even having this particular discussion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish up by saying to the government that we welcome, in principle, the purpose and function of schedule 2, but the way it is drafted now is not acceptable. We are simply saying: let's be sensible about it and redraft it. I finish up by saying, once again, that Labor is committed to bipartisanship, but it has to be a two-way process and it is not a race to the bottom. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. In summing up, schedule 1 to this bill delivers on the government's commitment to strengthen financial regulation and better protect Australians from the possible abuse and manipulation of financial markets by sophisticated financial institutions at their expense. Financial benchmarks are used to help value trillions of dollars of financial products and have proven to be a weak spot in the international system of financial regulation. There have been many cases of market misconduct regarding the determination of the financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR and all around the world. As of August 2017, penalties paid by financial institutions globally had reached around 25 billion in Australian dollar terms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing this play out in Australia as well. ASIC has commenced formal court proceedings against all four major banks for alleged market manipulation and unconscionable conduct in relation to the bank bill swap rate, Australia's most important interest rate benchmark. This case is ongoing. In 2015, in response to these issues and regulatory developments, the Treasurer directed the Council of Financial Regulators to consult on options for reform. Following a lengthy and detailed policy development process, the CFR broadly recommended that: administrators of benchmarks that are critically important to the operation of Australia's financial system be required to hold a benchmark administrator licence and comply with ASIC rules; that ASIC be empowered to compel submissions to significant benchmarks in the case that other calculation mechanisms fail, ensuring that, even in times of financial stress, this critical part of the financial system's plumbing continues to function; and, finally, that the manipulation of any financial benchmark or any product used to determine a financial benchmark in Australia be made a specific criminal and civil offence with hefty penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for an individual, to effectively deter misconduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms, which are embraced by the government, will enhance the robustness of these critical components of our market architecture and improve the integrity, resilience and fairness of Australia's financial systems. They will also align our regulatory regime with international best practice, including with regimes in the UK, the EU, Japan, Singapore and Canada. This is not only necessary to reduce the risk of regulatory arbitrage that could arise for the gaps in the implementation of global standards; without change, Australian businesses and individuals would likely lose the ability to fully participate in global markets. It's the view of the government that this would be an unacceptable outcome and would run contrary to our goals for the continued growth of the financial sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to this bill makes minor amendments to the Productivity Commission Act to appoint an additional commissioner, with experience in dealing with policies and programs affecting Indigenous Australians and involvement with Indigenous communities, to the Productivity Commission. This will ensure that the commission has a specialist commissioner with the necessary skills and experience to oversee the commission's important work in Indigenous policy evaluation and will allow us to better understand which policies and programs are effective in improving outcomes for Indigenous Australians. It's therefore been disappointing to see this bill delayed as a result of Labor's insistence to change the definition of an Indigenous person contained in the act. This definition has been contained in numerous acts enacted by the parliament, including under the previous Labor government. So, if the opposition's interested in changing the standard definition of an Indigenous person, a parliamentary amendment to this bill is clearly not the appropriate way to do it. Adopting an administrative definition, of which there is currently no common form, could set a precedent for future legislation and have significant legal implications. Consideration of how to define 'Indigenous' is a significant matter which we believe is well above politics, and it should be considered in a separate and far more thorough process. The opposition's approach to this matter is only delaying the passage of this legislation and, sadly, preventing the Productivity Commission from commencing its important new functions in the area of Indigenous affairs. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I'm speaking today on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (14-month Regional Independence Criteria) Bill 2018. In 2017 the parliament passed the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Student Payments) Bill with the support of Labor. The simplifying student payments bill included an amendment which made it easier for young people from regional and remote areas to qualify as independent for youth allowance purposes. Recipients of youth allowance are paid at either a dependent or an independent rate. The rate of youth allowance received by someone who's assessed as dependent is affected by their parents' income, whereas the rate for a recipient classed as independent is not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of ways an applicant can qualify as independent for the purposes of youth allowance, including where they have supported themselves through paid work over an 18-month period since finishing secondary school. The simplifying student payments act reduced the existing 18-month period to 14 months for students from regional and remote Australia. As a result of the change, from 1 January 2018, full-time students from regional or remote areas who need to move from their parental home to study can qualify as independent if, since leaving secondary school, they have, firstly, over a 14-month period earned 75 per cent or more of wage level A of the national training wage schedule included in a modern award—and in the 2017-18 financial year this was equal to $24,836—or, secondly, for at least two years worked at least 15 hours each week. Their parents must also have earned less than $150,000 in the previous tax year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was intended that the new 14-month period be applied to existing and new youth allowance applicants; however, a drafting error meant that this has only been applied to youth allowance applicants from 1 January 2018. The bill corrects this by applying the 14-month period to young people who were receiving youth allowance prior to 1 January 2018. It is anticipated that the bill would allow around 300 young Australians to claim independence for youth allowance purposes, using the reduced 14-month period, not the original 18-month period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will support this bill because, as with the previous act, we do believe that young Australians should have the right to a tertiary education, if they wish. Although this bill will help a small number of students, and that's a good thing, this government is making other changes that will have a significant negative impact on students. This conservative government has frozen Commonwealth grants for universities, effectively ending the demand-driven system and locking some students out of education. We've also seen this government propose a lowering of the threshold for the repayment of HECS-HELP loans to $45,000, meaning that more young Australians will have to repay their HECS-HELP debt sooner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was of course the former Labor government that lifted the caps on the number of university places, and this has led to significant increases in the number of students able to attend university. So, since places were uncapped in 2009, there has been a 55 per cent growth in university enrolments from the poorest fifth of Australian households, and a 48 per cent growth in regional and rural students at university. In addition, we've seen an 89 per cent growth in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students attending university and a 106 per cent increase in students with disabilities. That's been a wonderful change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lesson, sadly, seems to be that Labor opens the door to learning and opportunity but this conservative government, in large measure, shuts it. This Prime Minister's $2.2 billion cuts to universities are hitting home. Just today, Universities Australia chair Professor Margaret Gardner has urged the government not to 'slam the door of opportunity shut on young Australians who aspire to a tertiary education'. Make no mistake, these cuts will hurt regional and rural Australian students. We know that the Central Queensland University, the University of the Sunshine Coast and other smaller Queensland institutions have been holding emergency meetings on whether they could continue to offer some courses or services. There are reports that some universities are turning away students. It's estimated that around 10,000 students will miss out on a place at university this year as a result of this Prime Minister's harsh cuts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House want to make sure that Australians, particularly young Australians, have access to the best post-secondary opportunities in the world. Sadly, this Prime Minister wants to make it harder for young people to access post-secondary opportunities. I thank the House. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (14-month Regional Independence Criteria) Bill 2018. I thank the member for Jagajaga for those comments. The first half of her speech I thought was pretty to the point and on the money. The second half, I must say, I thought was a heap of political claptrap with very little truth in it. It has been a long haul addressing the injustices that rural, regional and remote students face in accessing tertiary education. Today we take another small step, but we still have a long way to go. Regional students make up just 18.8 per cent of entry-level university students, despite regional people comprising more than 25 per cent of the population. That's something we need to fix. This parliament dealt with the issue of the implications of the 18-month period a student must face before they could access independent youth allowance last year. It was an overhang and an overreach from the first Rudd government. A group of us have been fighting ever since to undo some of the reforms that the Rudd government brought in under Julia Gillard as the education minister at the time. There were some good things in it, but there were others that greatly disadvantaged regional students, and it's been a long battle putting some of those measures back in place and trying to fix up some other injustices that sit within the system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The system does not sufficiently recognise the cost of getting students from regional areas to university. The current estimate is around about $25,000 extra per year that country students face to access university, which city students, who can live with their families, do not face. For country students, living away from home is not an option; it's a necessity. There is the cost of emotional separation, the cost of accommodation, catering for oneself as opposed to being catered for by the family—I mean in the sense of food—and for most, the need to have a car of reasonable quality capable of the journey home, to go and visit family and recharge the batteries, if you like. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The education cost itself is not such an issue. The majority of tertiary education funding for students in Australia is met by the taxpayer with the contribution of the fully subsidised HECS-HELP loans. That side of the equation can be managed by the families. For some students, though, just knowing that parents don't have the ability to finance their tertiary education is enough to steer them away. They don't necessarily tell their parents. They don't want to put extra pressure on their family. They don't want their parents to be in a position of denying them access to tertiary education. So they say: 'Well, actually I don't really want to go to university. I would be happy doing A, B, and C.' They leave school and go off and get a job instead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many, youth allowance is the only way that they can get to university. It's a big help, but it still leaves a significant gap. However, once parental income reaches $57,000 a year or thereabouts, the rate of youth allowance begins to decline, until it disappears completely at around $108,000 with one child away from home. Remember, though, that these are before-tax earnings and not what parents have available as disposable income. However, regional students have been able to access independent youth allowance by showing they have been supporting themselves for a certain period of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a major area of contest since the first Rudd government changed the arrangements for access to independent youth allowance, when fair, reasonable access was made that much more difficult. And, since that time, I and a number of my like-minded colleagues—one has just joined me to my left, the member for Forrest—have worked together as a group. I call us the rural education rump. We have worked very hard to try and undo some of the damage, and we've had some success. In some areas we have done even better than the pre-existing situation. For instance, we've managed to negotiate different treatment for regional students for the assessment of the independent youth allowance, being for outer regional, remote and very remote students, recognising at least that there is some difference and extra challenges that these students face. We've also had the parental assets test removed, relying instead quite rightly on a parental means test, which has addressed the great problem of asset-rich and income-poor businesses, particularly, but not only, in the farming industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Jagajaga said independent youth allowance is not affected by parental income. Well, of course it's not—until you reach the point where the combined parental income is $150,000. It raises a very interesting question: what has the parents' income got to do with a student's independence? The student is either self-sufficient or not. I find that an anomaly in the system. I understand why it's there—because the $150,000 lines up with a whole lot of other cut-off areas in government assistance—but it's worth reflecting on that figure. Let's take, for example, a couple who might be a teacher and a council worker or a teacher and a policeman. With that $150,000, which is pre-tax, when you add another $25,000 per student that you are trying to get into tertiary education, it is quite a gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've also had an issue with the length of time a student is subject to justifying the independence criteria, which was 18 months. Last year we made that change. If they completed year 12 in November of the school year, the student would take a gap year to accumulate the required amount of minimum income, which at this stage is 75 per cent of the training wage level A, which is currently almost $25,000. This is a reasonable challenge but it is certainly not insurmountable. For instance, an income of $15 an hour from a retail outlet, for 35 hours a week, will accumulate that amount in 12 months. But the problem was that, even though the student might accumulate that target amount of earnings in 12 or 14 months, they couldn't qualify until the 18 months expired—about May in the second year after the student left school—pushing some to a two-year gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most would concur that that was far less than ideal and students needed to be very motivated to actually get through a two-year gap without being distracted and going off and finding another job and actually finding they are making progress there and perhaps never returning to their first true love or the thing that they really wanted to do. I certainly appreciated the opposition's support when that legislation went through this House last year and brought that qualification period back to 14 months. But today's legislation addresses that one-year group who were caught up in the change of the legislation and had already started on the qualification path when the goalposts changed. This fairly simple legislation today deals with this issue in a timely manner so, hopefully, those eligible students can begin to collect their support before university resumes in March—I think it is tomorrow. So we need to get onto this to get it through not only this chamber but the other place as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not the end. We have achieved so much, but there is still some distance to go. I spoke about the council and the retail worker and how their combined pay might be over $150,000 but it's still an enormous challenge. They can also be devilled by distance. Some of the people who earn money like this live in places like Roxby Downs or Karratha, where the cost of living can be substantially higher than in the city. I don't think we are fully recognising those extra challenges. The coalition education rump, might I say, has kept up its job. And the government has commissioned a report from Emeritus Professor John Halsey, from Flinders University, into rural, regional and remote education. Professor Halsey has a long background in rural education. His career includes significant stints as a country teacher and a principal. He is eminently qualified, with his later positions covering senior departmental and political appointments including executive officer of Rural Education Forum Australia and, most recently, Sidney Myer Chair of Rural Education and Communities at Flinders University.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Halsey will not only look at the subject of this legislation—namely, youth allowance and the funding of rural students to get into tertiary institutions in the city—but also look at a whole raft of other issues facing students from the country. In particular, I know he has a long interest in teacher and principal quality. There's also leadership. Leadership is so important in regional facilities, and I expect his report to have a significant input on this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only last week the Minister for Education and Training, Simon Birmingham, was in my electorate, and we visited John Pirie Secondary School in Port Pirie. The principal there—I will name him, because it's all good—is Roger Nottage. He's been there six years. I've been a visitor to John Pirie Secondary School over that period and before, and, without any reflection on those who preceded Roger Nottage, the school is a completely different place to where it was five or six years ago. As the minister and I walked around the grounds with Roger Nottage, he knew every student; he knew every teacher. He was having a personal conversation as he moved around the ground. As someone from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Castle</span> might have said: it's the vibe of the place. It's the vibe of the place, and it has completely changed. I would have thought, when I was walking around, that I was at a top-quality private school in the city. Kids were in uniform, and they were really applying themselves to their tasks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This illustrates the very important point of what leadership can do. I have seen the opposite in schools in my electorate where we've had really good standards and a new leader has come in who didn't know much about leadership. They were unskilled, and the school has gone into a spiral of decline. I'm expecting Professor Halsey's report to focus on leadership and teacher quality because he has a long history of advocating in these areas. I would be very surprised if they were not in the report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think—because he has flagged this issue when I and others have spoken to him—he will also look at the expectation that some schools have of students and of how they are considered a failure if they don't access university education. This is something that we need to face up to. As Australia is expanding into a services based economy, we are going to need workers with services based skills, whether they be in nursing and aged care or manufacturing and engineering. Tertiary or university education is not for every student, and many will find their way in the world in the very highly respected trades, which I think increasingly will be well rewarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm looking forward to the Halsey report, I'm looking forward to reading it carefully, and I'm looking forward to working with my rural rump, if you like, to make sure that we, on this side of the parliament, keep pushing for a better deal for rural students. We have a little way to go. We've come a long way, but we are going to keep at it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  Like the member for Grey, I am very pleased to be speaking on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (14-month Regional Independence Criteria) Bill 2018, particularly as it's to do with independent youth allowance. The member for Grey and I and a number of our colleagues have worked tirelessly on this issue, virtually since we were elected to this place. This bill is directly aimed at assisting more rural and regional students—the young people who live in my and the member for Grey's electorates—to achieve their higher education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ever since I was elected, I've pursued equity of access to higher education for rural and regional students, who have no choice but to leave home to study. These young people have no choice. So I was absolutely horrified when the then Labor government changed the independence criteria and physically excluded students from areas defined as 'inner regional'. These were my students. Labor was diverting funds from disadvantaged regional Australian families and students and delivering the funds to outer-metropolitan seats, which were Labor-held seats. This change meant that the majority of young people in my electorate were ineligible to even apply for independent youth allowance. These are the young people who live three to four hours from Perth, where they had to go to pursue their higher education studies. I remember only too well the numbers of families and young people who came to me in absolute desperation—and it was desperation. For many, this meant they had no choice but to give up their dreams, their goals and their plans to attend university. It was just dreadful to see. It changed some of those young people's lives forever, because they took a different path at that time—different to what they would have taken had they gone on to university. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I submitted a private members' motion in 2010. It called on the then Labor government to reverse this decision that discriminated against inner-regional students. The motion was supported by the majority of members in this House at the time, and was the first defeat on the floor for an incumbent government for a long time, and well it should have been. It was a disgraceful, discriminatory decision. But, unfortunately for our rural and regional students, the process of removing the funding from them and their families and redirecting it to Labor-held seats is actually Labor's standard operating procedure. It's what Labor governments do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing a very similar approach to education from the WA state Labor government, with announcements of $64 million of education cuts, mostly in regional and rural areas. There were cuts to the five Schools of the Air and to the gifted and talented programs in Northam Residential College. It took concerted public pressure for these particular cuts to be reversed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, the CWA actually marched on state parliament to protest against the remaining $41 million of sweeping cuts to regional education. The closure of the Moora Residential College demonstrates that regional students and regional families do not matter to Labor. However, one of the most blatant and ill conceived cash grabs is taking 20 per cent of the funds from the Agricultural Education Provisions Trust. This takes money from our agricultural colleges and the Esperance Farm Training Centre in WA. These AEPT funds are earned and generated by the colleges themselves from selling their own produce. The Harvey ag school in my electorate will lose at least $50,000 a year. These are the funds the ag school uses for farm machinery, for developing their farms, for repairing and replacing fences and for the constant recurrent costs they have to meet. Labor is cutting hundreds of thousands of dollars from these regional ag schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that agricultural is critical to the WA and Australian economies. It is worth $8.2 million to the WA economy alone. I'm unashamedly a farmer. Our future farmers—our young people—need the best possible education with the most current innovations and training technologies: the machinery, the tools and the trades equipment. The Harvey ag school's trades training centre is exceptional. The students currently have access to very well-equipped workshops. They are training on the machinery and tools currently being used in the relevant industries: automotive, construction, furnishing, metals and engineering. They also offer ATAR and general academic pathways for students. The ag school is an economic contributor to our local economy, providing employment and sourcing inputs from local businesses. Over 600 students attend these colleges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this is a pattern of behaviour from Labor governments, whether federal or state. We saw it at the federal level with the changes to youth allowance. It was devastating—directly and deliberately removing funding from rural and regional students and redistributing it into the cities. In contrast, the Turnbull government has made a number of improvements and changes to youth allowance to assist more of our students in rural and regional areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how important the changes have been. We know that students from regional areas are significantly underrepresented in tertiary education. A far greater percentage of metro students go on with their tertiary education, compared to our young people from rural and regional areas. One of the major barriers is the extra cost, which is around $25,000 a year. Accommodation is one of those costs. Regional students can't just go home to mum and dad for the night. They also need to have a car to get to the city from where they live in the country. They need to fund their daily living expenses while they're away from home. There are far greater costs for tertiary education for our kids and families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some students I've met, as the member for Grey rightly said, have made conscious decisions to not aspire to attend university in Perth or elsewhere, because they know their families simply can't afford it. What a tragedy this is! And it was a tragedy back in 2010 as well when Labor changed the rules and excluded those great young people. Some parents in my area have two jobs to support their children's higher education. These are the reasons I and my colleagues will continue to do everything we can to help our great young people get the education and training they need to pursue their talents, their ambitions and their dreams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another barrier for some students has been the requirement to wait for 18 months after leaving school to qualify for independent youth allowance. We, on this side, have worked consistently to change this requirement. In practical terms it has meant that students have had to take two years away from their study, working to earn the amount required to demonstrate their independence so they can qualify for youth allowance. Parents and students have repeatedly sought this change. I've heard about it over and over. Effectively, it will mean that students finishing high school at the end of 2018 will be able to qualify for youth allowance and start uni in 2020 instead of having to wait till 2021, as they would have previously. So, instead of taking two gap years, they will only have to take one. This bill actually helps 300 students who have not been able to take advantage of the reduced 14-month period: those that remained in the transition under the old 18-month rule. This reduction in time was an election commitment that we made and that we're very proud of, Member for Grey. You called us—</span>

                    </a>  the rural education rump. It is a very appropriate description of us, because we have been absolutely committed to this and we have been absolutely persistent. We have made several changes to improve the access for rural and regional students, but as I, the member for Grey and my colleagues know there is more work to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked consistently and persistently—I think they're the two words we would use, Member for Grey—with my regional colleagues on this issue. The Minister for Education and Training, Senator Simon Birmingham, responded to what we knew needed to be done by asking Professor John Halsey to conduct an independent review into regional, rural and remote education. These are the fresh eyes that we've believed for some time were needed to look at what is the appropriate way to assist our young people in their education challenges. The review considered key ideas in the challenges and the barriers that affect students' learning outcomes. I've been pushing for and am very keen to see a fresh approach. It's what we've been seeking, and it's what the minister has responded to, through Professor Halsey. It would be a fresh approach that actually supports better access and better achievement for rural, regional and remote students. We want to see the transition to further study, training and work. These are all issues we've been working on for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review is actually going to investigate the gap in educational achievement between rural, regional and remote students and metropolitan students; the key barriers and challenges that I've talked about; the appropriateness and effectiveness of current modes of education delivered to regional, rural and remote students, including the use of information and communication technology; and the effectiveness of public policies and programs. This is where, I think, we're looking for that fresh approach to bridge the gaps and opportunities to help students successfully move from school to further study, training and employment. It will also critically look at new approaches—something we've sought for some time. It will look at a new approach that actually supports regional, rural and remote students to succeed in school and in their transition to further study, training and employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a lot of consultations. As members on my side will know, I certainly insisted that Professor Halsey come to my electorate to hear firsthand the issues facing students, parents and educators in my electorate. As the member for Grey has said, Professor Halsey came to Bunbury. His focus on leadership and teacher quality is a key part of what we will see out of the Halsey report, in my view. Again, leadership in rural and regional areas is critically important. We have some amazing leaders in our schools, and they face additional challenges in rural, regional and even remote areas. As we on this side have said repeatedly, we understand directly how, unfortunately, the changes made by a Labor government many years ago have created an ongoing problem. We have made a number of changes that have improved the access for rural, regional and remote students. But there is more work to be done. With the persistence and the focus that my colleagues and I have on this matter, along with the support of the minister, I'm very sure there will be much we can use from what Professor Halsey delivers to make sure our students get fairer access, access that they need, to be able to pursue their higher education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I deal with a number of families on a regular basis who find it incredibly challenging to meet the additional costs of sending students away to university. It is significant. It is very difficult for a couple who may be on an income just above the parental income test of $150,000. During the time that Labor had made the changes, I remember a woman came to see me and said, 'I've had to make a dreadful choice.' I said, 'What was your choice?' She said: 'I have five wonderful kids. They are all capable and are achieving wonderful ATAR scores, and all five want to train to be GPs.' We have a shortage of GPs in regional areas. She said, 'I have to make a choice as to which one of those is able to go to university.' That concerns me greatly. These families live and work and contribute so significantly to the economics and the prosperity that comes out of our region, which supports much of Australia, especially when you look at our exports. I am very pleased to support this bill and every measure ahead that we will take to improve access for rural and regional students. I thank and commend all of my colleagues who stayed with us in this whole process to make sure we reverse some of those changes made by Labor and look at new opportunities ahead for our rural and regional students.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Human Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  The Social Services Legislation Amendment (14-month Regional Independence Criteria) Bill 2018 makes a minor technical amendment to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Student Payments) Act 2017. The act supported regional and remote students by amending the rules governing when a person will be regarded as independent for the purposes of youth allowance. It intended to reduce from 18 months to 14 months the period young people from regional and remote areas of Australia have to earn the amount required to satisfy the workforce independence provisions. This measure commenced from 1 January this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reduction to 14 months was an election commitment and part of a package to support regional students' access to education. Students whose family home is in a regional or remote location can access youth allowance on the basis of being independent under concessional workforce participation arrangements. One way in which students can demonstrate they have supported themselves is through a period or periods of employment over 14 months since leaving secondary school, with earnings totalling at least 75 per cent of the wage level A of the national training wage. This is $24,836 for the 2017-18 financial year. In addition, to access these arrangements, students' parental income must be below $150,000, they must be undertaking full-time study and they must be required to live away from home to study. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure recognised that regional and remote students face additional costs in pursuing tertiary education and have much lower participation rates in higher education than students from major cities. The reduced period from 18 months to 14 months allows students to qualify for youth allowance four months sooner than under previous arrangements. Students are now able to take a gap year at the end of secondary school and, subject to them satisfying the other qualification requirements for youth allowance, receive payment as independent the following year. Students who are considered independent for youth allowance purposes do not have their rate of payment affected by parental income, as is the case for dependent recipients. Previously, students who qualified for youth allowance under these arrangements may have commenced study prior to qualifying for student payments or have taken two gap years in order to satisfy the 18-month criteria before commencing study and qualifying for payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The longer students are disengaged from study after completing secondary school, such as for more than a year, the less likely they will be to commence or complete tertiary study. It is estimated that, over the forward estimates, approximately 3,700 regional and remote students will qualify for youth allowance as independent under the 14-month period. Approximately 2½ thousand would become eligible for payment as independent four months earlier than under the previous 18-month period. Approximately 1,200 would become eligible for payment as independent who otherwise would not have met the independence criteria. This includes students who choose to take a gap year, who may have not undertaken a gap year otherwise. These young people are expected to change their employment and study patterns in order to earn the required amount in 14 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this measure commencing on 1 January this year, an unintended consequence of the act has meant that a small group of approximately 300 students has not been able to take advantage of the reduced 14-month period. Young people who were receiving youth allowance prior to 1 January this year were unintentionally left behind. This group remained under the old 18-month rule. For example, a young person who finished school in 2016 and worked throughout 2017, hoping to qualify as independent and went on youth allowance as a dependent recipient, would have the 18-month period apply to them. For a young person from a regional area who requires the full rate of youth allowance in order to move away from home to study, having the 18-month period apply to them could mean that they have to delay university for an extra year. This bill will correct the unintended consequence of the act and will mean that the 14-month period is available to all students seeking independence for youth allowance under the workforce independence provisions for regional and remote tertiary students. This bill will insure that the 14-month period is applied consistently to all tertiary students from regional areas. I therefore commend the bill to the House. </span>

The bill amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966 by limiting the class of persons who can offer services as registered debt agreement administrators, trustees or official trustees. Limiting who can be a debt agreement administrator by reference to skills and capabilities will provide an additional safeguard against sharp practice, which disproportionately affects disadvantaged, marginalised and vulnerable people who are at higher risk of being damaged if exposed to unscrupulous or iniquitous practices. The nascent debt agreement administration industry as well as any individuals who are administering their own agreement are given six months following the royal assent to this bill to gain the necessary skills and effect transitional requirements. This provides creditors and debtors with the certainty they require to transition any existing arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor support, subject to any necessary amendments arising as recommendations from the ongoing Senate inquiry, the insertion of a provision which requires debt agreement administrators to specify expressly in any debt agreement the expenses which may be charged by the administrator. The repayment of debt, often by disadvantaged people with limited financial literacy, should not be an exercise in profit gouging by debt agreement administrators. We support giving both debtors and creditors access to the debt agreement administrator's proposed expenses so they can assess the reasonableness of the expenses and, if necessary, seek independent financial or legal advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the setting of a cap on the percentage of a debtor's after-tax income that can be agreed to be repaid in the repayment schedule of the debt agreement. However, Labor is concerned that the bill, as it currently stands, leaves the setting of the percentage to ministerial discretion. Labor would prefer for the percentage to be given a statutory footing to ensure that debtors are easily able to ascertain the maximum amount that can be set out in the debt repayment schedule. We will await the recommendations of the Senate inquiry in respect of the proper setting of the percentage cap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the bill has inserted a new provision that requires the debt agreement repayment schedule to be time limited to three years. This is a significant issue and Labor reserves its right to seek an amendment in the Senate. The policy basis, as asserted in the explanatory memorandum, is that the provision of three years enables the responsible minister to set a capped percentage rate which will be uniform across all debt agreements. There is no substantive issue with the policy of setting a percentage rate which operates in parallel to an agreed time frame. However, the nominated time of three years may place undue and unnecessary pressure on vulnerable people who are already struggling to get out from underneath debts which have led them into a debt agreement. Extending the possible repayment time frame to, for example, five years does not unduly burden the rights of creditors to repayment, particularly in circumstances where the great majority of creditors are large credit providers. It does, however, appropriately balance the rights of creditors with those of debtors who should not be placed under undue strain to repay debt. Moreover, it achieves the stated policy aim of giving a temporal framework against which the calculation of the percentage cap can be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes the measures in schedule 1 that seek to limit the possibility of conflicts of interest and increase transparency of the corporate arrangements of companies and persons who offer services as registered debt agreement administrators, including the disclosure requirements for related entities. Labor supports, in principle, the amendment set out in schedule 2 of the bill. But, consistent with my comments on the need to provide for a longer time for repayment in debt agreements, Labor will await the Senate inquiry recommendations before considering whether or not to seek an amendment providing for an extension of the repayment schedule time frame. This would allow for vulnerable debtors who enter into overambitious debt repayment schedules to seek a variation of their debt agreement to provide more time for repayment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the measures in schedule 3 of the bill which provide for more rigorous registration requirements, including that the Inspector-General interview applicants after processing their paper applications and that the trustee or registered debt agreement administrator has taken out professional indemnity and fidelity insurance. Labor also supports the further measures in schedule 3 which empower the Inspector-General to obtain information from banks and financial institutions confirming whether or not a separate bank account is being maintained for the purpose of managing the debtor's repayments under the debt agreement. Labor will always support measures that require the proper discharge of statutory duties and safeguard vulnerable people. This is a good measure. It is aimed at preventing the misuse or misappropriation of money held on trust to pay down the debt by registered debt agreement administrators or official trustees. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  Like the member for Isaacs, the most excellent shadow Attorney-General, I rise to support the Bankruptcy Amendment (Debt Agreement Reform) Bill 2018. In relation to the Bankruptcy Act, as we know, these amendments reform the Commonwealth debt agreement system. The debt agreement system is a good thing in that it provides an alternative to bankruptcy, and it is increasingly being used in that way. The bill contains a number of measures that the government claims will improve the existing debt agreement system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why this is very important at this point in time is the unprecedented level of financial stress that we see in Australian communities and families today. Further analysis released as recently as earlier this month confirmed what we hear and see in our electorates every day—that many households' financial situation is getting worse, with the culprit being living expenses. Forty per cent reported this as a key reason their situation is worsening. It is cited that almost 46 per cent of households surveyed also claimed the cost of necessities, such as fuel, utilities and groceries, is their biggest worry in relation to financial stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why these reforms are clearly required as an alternative to bankruptcy is apparent when we see the increased level of bankruptcies prevalent in our community. More than 32,000 Australians went bankrupt in 2017, which is a 6.1 per cent year-on-year increase, according to an analysis of bankruptcy figures by illion, who were recently recognised as the Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit reporting agency. Now that has increased in itself, with a 4.7 per cent year-on-year hike recorded in 2016. When we look at the causes for that it is very apposite to hear illion's Chief Executive Simon Bligh saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consumer debt levels are rising steadily in Australia as a result of record mortgages and a surge in everyday essentials such as utilities, petrol and healthcare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, those factors, combined with the very poor wage growth that we are seeing under this government, are putting pressure on the wallets of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no coincidence here that the illion credit reporting agency is also seeing strong growth in the payday loans sector, which Mr Bligh says is often an early indicator of people getting in trouble in terms of paying their utility bills. That assessment is certainly confirmed when one reviews the data from the Credit and Investments Ombudsman. They released information to confirm systemic problems in the consumer leases and payday loans sectors. The CIO's recent annual report on operations reported that small- and medium-amount lenders accounted for 12.2 per cent of total complaints—the second highest, following debt collectors. Most of the complaints around small- and medium-amount lenders related to inappropriate finance, including irresponsible lending which made up over 56 per cent of those complaints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in case one is thinking that these are isolated incidents—and they are certainly not—according to the industry data released by the payday loans sector itself, in 2015-16 there were over 619,000 new payday loans, with a book of over $476 million advanced. Just in case you need any further evidence as to whether these credit arrangements are being taken up by those most vulnerable in society, let's look at those who are applying for small-amount credit contract loans. We know that two in five of those who entered a SACC loan in this period were unemployed, that one in four—26 per cent—of these loans were given to people receiving more than 50 per cent of their income from Centrelink and that one in six of these loans were entered into with a customer with an existing loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the second quarter of 2015, 75 per cent of lenders admitted to providing small-amount credit contract loans to customers who have had two or more small-amount credit contract loans in the previous 90 days. We also know that most people apply for these loans online—over 78 per cent in the second quarter of 2016. What it means is that these loans are quicker and easier to get than ever before. The average amount of a payday loan was $770. What we see is an effective interest rate on these loans of over 170 per cent on average. There are outlying cases that are truly horrendous in terms of the total repayment rates that are required. But if we average it all out we see an interest rate of over 190 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in a landscape of unprecedented levels of financial stress. There are over 8.47 million households that are financially stressed—those with mortgage stress, behind in lower-end payments, declined some form of credit or constantly borrowing to repay existing loans. There are an extraordinary number of financially distressed households that have gone even further in relation to financial stress—those who are repeat borrowers with limited options and unable to find $2,000 in an emergency within seven days. We are dealing with 1.8 million households—over 20 per cent of all households are financially distressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It means that reform in this area is absolutely imperative. But it also means that reform before vulnerable consumers get to this point in time is even more imperative. That is why it has been the Labor Party who has taken the steps that this government will not take to introduce reforms into this place by way of a private member's bill in the small-amount credit contract space. The tailored bipartisanship, which is increasingly difficult to find under this government, started in a positive manner in relation to payday loans and the rent-to-buy arena. The mandated review, the small-amount credit contract review, was undertaken and concluded in March 2016. To the credit of the Minister for Finance at that time, the review was considered very carefully. There is no criticism whatsoever of that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2016, the government did the right thing and published its response to the small-amount credit contract review. The response was effectively an unconditional approval of the recommendations on the payday loan and rent-to-buy space—again, a positive step. That was in November 2016. Again, the reforms do not seek to shut down this industry and will not mean that financially vulnerable consumers do not have recourse. Parents with already stretched budgets, managing every dollar, faced with the fact that a washing machine has blown up and having five kids to get to school, need ready recourse to small amounts of funding in a circumstance where they can't otherwise obtain it. But it has to be on a playing field that is level and fair. And that is all these reforms sought to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, to the government's credit, it took them 12 months but they went so far as actually committing these reforms to proposed legislation which simply seeks to do two substantive things in addition to providing regulatory safety in this area. Firstly, quite reasonably, they will look at ensuring that the amount that can be borrowed to be repaid is ring-fenced at 10 per cent of a consumer's net income. That was agreed to by the government. Tick. Secondly, they seek to ring-fence the time it takes to repay the loan and the way in which one applies interest over that time period. Again, that was ticked off by the government. Tick. Despite some bumps along the road in the form of inaccuracies from the Minister for Finance as to how far down the legislative path these reforms were actually being pursued, the minister for consumer affairs, as he then was—now the Deputy Prime Minister—published in October last year that legislation which had been approved by cabinet—tick.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That press release made it very clear that two things were going to occur. The first was that the legislation would only be out in the wild for consultation for two weeks—quite right, because none of this was new and it all had bipartisan support. The second promise by the now Deputy Prime Minister—who, again, to his credit has demonstrated a track record of keeping his word—was that the legislation would be introduced last year, in 2017, after a long, long wait for vulnerable consumers, who shouldn't have to wait any longer. The legislation, again, was substantively endorsed by the peak body representing vulnerable consumers, which is again understandable because it represented a reasonable compromise in relation to the regulatory protections. But then it sank like a stone. In circumstances where the community is crying out for a demonstration of bipartisanship in this place, we got so close and this government squibbed it. They shirked it at the last moment. Having gone so far down the road, having got the tick-off from cabinet, nothing more was heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a change of ministerial responsibilities, and we know the payday lending sector is on the march. We know that there is a furious level of activity going on behind the scenes from this government, convening the now famous, or infamous, parliamentary friends of payday lending, to try to bury what was otherwise a sensible piece of legislation. It won't do. It is something which should be stopped, which should be discouraged and which we are surely all better than in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, instead of pushing off responsible legislation to the long grass, now has a choice, because the legislation is in this place. It has been introduced as a private member's bill by the Labor Party, which has not a single sentence, comma or full stop changed from the government's legislation that went through their cabinet process. It's now here, whether they like it or not. If the government were really interested and substantively concerned about protecting vulnerable consumers, as they purport to be with the introduction of this legislation, they would actually do the right thing here. They would actually be honest and say that the small-amount credit contract legislation is the right thing to put into place for the protection of all of those millions of households facing crippling financial distress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government have a choice. If they want to be responsible, grown up and honest, they can actually do what they always said they were going to do, which is back their own legislation, which is now in this place and which should not wait for its implementation in order to ensure that the increasing number of financially stressed and vulnerable consumers in this country have at least some level of protection to ensure that they are not in a situation where they stare down the barrel of another debt agreement arrangement as an alternative to bankruptcy in the way that this legislation otherwise provides.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="208884" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PORTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I would like to thank all the honourable members for their contributions. I thank the shadow Attorney-General for his contribution on this bill and the member for Perth for his contribution on a bill completely unrelated to this bill. In any event, this is the Bankruptcy Amendment (Debt Agreement Reform) Bill 2018. The debt agreement system is an important part of Australia's consumer finance framework. It provides debtors with an opportunity to avoid bankruptcy and manage their personal debts while giving creditors a return on what they are owed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to consumer protection safeguards, it is notable that statistics from the Australian Financial Security Authority confirm that debt agreements are on the rise. As debt agreements continue to grow in popularity, it's obviously important to ensure that the system works as it was intended. Debt agreements should not be used to exploit vulnerable people or to short-change creditors. Instances of misuse can disproportionately impact the integrity of the system and undermine the positive function it serves. This bill ensures that necessary consumer protection safeguards are in place so that the debt agreement system provides a fair and effective outcome for debtors and creditors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a concerning trend in recent years of debt agreements lasting significantly longer than five years. That trend, it was observed, threatens to prevent those in financial difficulty from getting back on their feet. This bill will prevent people spending an excessive amount of time in a debt agreement and will ensure that debtors can only propose a debt agreement of a three-year period or less. In reducing the length of a debt agreement proposal, the Turnbull government is making sure that debt agreements are an avenue for debtors to achieve a fresh start. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Debt agreement administrators play a crucial role in the effective operation of the debt agreement system, and administrators must possess the skills and knowledge to properly perform their functions. Administrators must also have the character and integrity to gain the confidence of creditors and financial counsellors. This bill raises the required standards of administrators to ensure that the industry is capable and professional. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of conclusion, it should be noted that this is the first comprehensive overhaul of Australia's debt agreement system in more than a decade, and these reforms will ensure that debt agreements are administered by only those persons with the appropriate skill set and knowledge base. Following the reforms, new debt agreement proposals will only be able to be three years in duration, enabling people to get back on their financial feet sooner. The reforms are designed to ensure that the integrity of the industry is improved overall. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the number of new debt agreements almost doubling in the last decade, debt agreements are proving to be an important, effective and popular alternative to bankruptcy for many individuals who are facing financial difficulties. These reforms will introduce necessary safeguards, bolster community confidence in the industry and ensure that the system allows people to achieve a fresh start. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

The measures, with the exception of the deferred tax liabilities measure and the securitised assets measure, were originally announced by the former Labor government in 2013-14. The bill implements recommendations made by the Board of Taxation in 2012 and 2013 and reflects consultation carried out by Treasury and the Board of Taxation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the second reading amendment makes clear, Labor believes that we need to go further in cracking down on multinational tax avoidance. One in five of Australia's biggest companies paid no tax for at least the past three years. We heard in Senate estimates last night that despite the besmirching of the careful work on the issue of corporate taxpaying carried out by Emma Alberici, the ABC's economics correspondent, ABC executives were unable to identify any specific errors in that work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of deep concern to many Australians that the government's biggest economic priority is a budget-busting corporate tax cut that will increase household income, on their own numbers, by 0.1 per cent in the 2030s. 0.1 per cent in the 2030s reflects another month's growth in household income. That is, according to the government's best estimates, the one-off benefit of their budget-busting big business tax cut. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does it deliver such small gains? It reflects in part the fact that Australia's corporate tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack, according to Congressional Budget Office analysis published in March last year. Our statutory rate places us 10th in the G20. Following the United States' recent tax cut we would be the ninth highest in the G20. But our effective rate places us in the bottom half of the G20 for corporate tax. We, unlike other countries, don't have state corporate income taxes. Unlike most other countries in the G20 or the OECD, we have dividend imputation, a system which gives back about a third of the corporate tax revenue. So from a fiscal perspective, the perspective that the government used to say that they cared about, a corporate tax rate of 30 per cent with dividend imputation raises about as much for the budget as a corporate tax rate of 20 per cent without imputation. Anyone who talks about corporate rate cuts and fails to mention imputation is being deeply disingenuous. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals said that they cared about the deficit when they were in opposition. Not only did they say it, but the now Prime Minister was photographed in front of debt trucks with terrifyingly large numbers—terrifying for him back them, but about half of what he's produced right now. The fact is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer really don't care about deficits any longer. The attacks on the deficit were all a smokescreen for the cuts to social services in the 2014 budget. They care deeply about the deficit if it's an excuse to take money away from the poorest Australians, but they don't care at all about the deficit when it comes to the debate over corporate tax. When it comes to a big business tax giveaway of $65 billion, they're not at all worried about the deficit. At least they're not worried now, but of course we know what will happen, because we've seen this playbook before. We know that as the deficit and debt continues to blow out as a result of these corporate income tax cuts, were they to get them through, they would be back in this parliament saying that the real problem with the Australian budget is that social services are 'unaffordable'. 'That's why we have to cut the pension, cut supports to people with disabilities and take money away from sole parents and students.' That's what they would be coming back and saying. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the 'starve the beast' strategy that we've seen under the US Republicans for so long. The Republicans in the United States have spoken so often about caring about debt and deficits. But if you look under Ronald Reagan or George W Bush you see an increase in the deficit. The US Republicans care about debt and deficits as an excuse, a fig leaf, to take money out of the social safety net, but when they're talking about their own tax cuts suddenly they're not worried about debt and deficits at all. We've seen it with President Trump at the moment putting in place a corporate income tax cut which is going to massively add to that country's deficit. And we see it back here in Australia: a Prime Minister getting off the plane from the United States and saying that we need a corporate tax giveaway, we need to bust the budget—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The corporate tax debate we're having in Australia does echo the United States' debate and does go directly to the question of the sustainability of the Australian budget. Labor believes that we need to crack down on multinational tax avoidance. We have announced a series of measures that would add directly to the bottom line of the budget. For the benefit of the House—indeed, for the benefit of the member for Gilmore—I will go through some of those measures. Labor would tighten debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies, improving the budget by more than $4 billion over the medium term. We would introduce public reporting of country-by-country reports, which are high-level information about where and how much tax is paid by large corporations. We would provide protection for whistleblowers who report on entities evading tax to the Australian Taxation Office and, where whistleblower information results in more tax being paid, we would allow them to collect a share of the tax penalty—being a reward of up to $250,000—as occurs in the United States and the United Kingdom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would introduce a publicly accessible register of beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts, allowing everyone to find out who really owns our firms and ensuring that shareholders can't use complex structures and sham ownership to avoid complying with corporate tax rules. We would introduce mandatory shareholding reporting of tax haven exposure. If a company is doing business in a tax haven, we believe that shareholders should know about it. There is a mood across the OECD to crack down on tax havens. Shareholders need to know if their corporate boards are making a decision to do business in a tax haven. The member for Gilmore might think it's all right to do business in a tax haven, but my guess is that the people of Gilmore would be deeply concerned about firms that were doing business in a tax haven and not informing their shareholders of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would appoint a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation to ensure community sector voices are heard in tax design and review processes. We would introduce public reporting of AUSTRAC data and require the annual public release of international cashflow data. We would require government tenderers to disclose their country-of-tax domicile. If they are tendering for contracts worth more than $200,000, the Australian public have a right to know where their country of tax domicile is. We would develop guidelines on tax haven investment by superannuation funds, working with the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. We would require that the Australian Taxation Office in its annual report provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. We would deliver more tax transparency by restoring Labor's $100 million threshold for public reporting of tax data for private firms—a threshold raised from $100 million to $200 million by the Liberals and the Greens, effectively taking two-thirds of private firms out of the tax transparency net.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that we have a multinational tax system with integrity, a multinational tax system which ensures that firms pay their fair share of tax. This is a worthy bill in itself, but it doesn't go far enough. We can add to the budget bottom line in a fair and responsible way. Labor urges the government to do the right thing on closing multinational tax loopholes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Fenner. The purpose of this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Consolidation Integrity) Bill 2018, is quite complicated, and it comes about as a result of consultation that was undertaken by Treasury with interested participants from industry and tax experts that work in this area. They published a paper that looked at the advantages that multi-entry consolidated groups have over domestic Australian resident-owned head companies that consolidate to form a group for taxation purposes. They did find that there were a number of advantages that the multi-entry consolidated groups had over the domestically based companies, and this bill seeks to amend and remove some of those taxation advantages that exist in the current law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Australian law, the consolidation regime applies mainly to a wholly owned group of Australian resident entities that choose to form a consolidated group for income tax purposes. A consolidated group generally consists of an Australian resident head company and all of its wholly owned resident subsidiaries. Specific rules allow for certain resident wholly owned subsidiaries of a foreign holding company to consolidate by forming a multiple entry consolidated group. Of course, these measures, except for the deferred tax liability measures and the securitised assets measures, were originally announced by Labor in the 2013-14 budget. So it's good to see that the government finally has adopted the recommendations of this working party and Labor's proposal and brought this legislation to the parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going into the details of this, because it's quite a complicated piece of legislation, but I want to point out that this is an element of a policy that Labor has been pushing for some years in order to clean up the tax system, to close loopholes—particularly for foreign multinationals to avoid paying their fair share of tax in Australia—and ultimately to raise more revenue for the budget to fund education, health and infrastructure services. We've had a clear plan on integrity for tax measures for some time. When you consider that one in five of Australia's biggest companies has paid no company tax for the past three years—that's no tax from those who can most afford it—it's not a fair contribution to key areas of public spending such as hospitals, schools, universities and infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, health is one area where most Australians can least afford the imposition of ill health and bad luck. I recently received a letter from a constituent who has been on the waiting list for a double-hip replacement for some months now. He was meant to be operated on in June last year, and when he contacted me earlier this year he hadn't heard anything from the doctor or the hospital, the Prince of Wales in Randwick, where he was supposed to have the surgery. It was only as a result of my intervention and writing a letter to the Minister for Health in New South Wales that he finally did get some action, and he is hopeful that that surgery will now take place. I raise this as an example of the fact that this government has cut funding to hospitals. It has continued the freeze on Medicare, which has forced some doctors to push up the rebate, and it is having an effect on our health system. It is having an effect on our health system in terms of elective waiting surgery times and, of course, hospital emergency departments. In the context of this government now wanting to provide a $65 billion tax cut over the next decade to the largest Australian corporations, to the big companies, when people can't get the adequate health services that they need, when schools during the summer don't have air conditioning so the students are sitting there in sweltering heat, when infrastructure that's vital to unclog our cities isn't being developed, you can understand why Australians are frustrated that this government is offering a big tax cut to the wealthiest multinational corporations, most of the advantage of which will go overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost of living is a huge issue for Australian families and pensioners. Over recent years, they have been facing the rising cost of electricity. The cost of insurance has gone up. The cost of child care has gone through the roof. Housing, in my area, is just ever increasing. On this notion that the housing market is coming off the boil, I urge people to come and have a look at the area that I live in. They would fail to see that that evidence is actually taking place at the moment. Pensioners can't afford to switch on air conditioners during summer, because they can't afford their electricity bills. Cost of living is a huge issue at the moment for Australians who are struggling to make ends meet. Yet this government is proposing to cut taxes for the largest companies and corporations and give them a tax break, but at the same time it is increasing taxes for hardworking Australians by increasing the Medicare levy by 0.5 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Labor's not buying it. We've said that we're opposed to this proposed company tax cut. We want to keep that money in the federal budget to properly fund health, education and infrastructure. We've said we'll consider cutting company taxes, as we have in the past, once the budget is back in surplus, which is the fiscally responsible and sensible thing for a government to do. But this government, on its ideological crusade, won't have a bar of that and is persisting with this notion, which is opposed by the majority of Australians, that it should cut company tax and that that benefit will trickle down to workers. Of course, we don't know that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're using the US as an example. They're saying, on the back of their lovey-dovey tour last week to the US, that Australia is going to be uncompetitive when it comes to corporate taxes and will fall behind. But, interestingly, the Congressional Budget Office in the United States recently published a paper where they looked at what they call the effective rates of company tax throughout the world, and they gave countries international rankings. An effective rate of tax is one where the whole nature of a taxation system is considered in terms of the eventual rate of tax that a corporation might pay, and it includes things like dividend imputation in Australia, the tax credit that shareholders will get for tax that's already been paid by the corporation at a company level; depreciation and the fact that certain assets can be depreciated at a faster pace in Australia than in other nations; instant asset write-offs, which are related to depreciation, of course, but provide an opportunity to write that asset off over the course of one year; and, of course, the deductions that exist in a particular nation. We all know that Australia has a very generous system of deductions for income spent in generating a profit for a business, most notably in the resources sector, where it's basically the case that companies don't begin paying any tax until they make substantial profits. They're some of the most generous deduction systems in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on those characteristics, the Congressional Budget Office ranked the effective tax rates of nations, and they found that Australia's effective tax rate is around 11 per cent, but that of the United States is around 16 per cent. So, when you look at effective rates of tax for corporations, we're actually lower than the United States, based on this study by the Congressional Budget Office. But this government seeks to ignore those facts and will push on with a policy that is deeply unpopular in the Australian community, who would rather see people hold that money in the budget to spend on education, health and infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got a plan to tighten up some of the tax loopholes that exist and crack down on tax havens. That clear plan to tighten debt deduction loopholes used by multinational corporations will improve the budget bottom line by $4 billion over the medium term. Labor will also introduce public reporting of country-by-country reports, high-level taxation, and information about where tax was paid, and how much tax was paid, by large corporations, those with over a billion dollars in global revenue. Providing protection for whistleblowers who report those entities evading their taxation obligations to the Australian Taxation Office is also very important. Where whistleblower information results in more tax being paid, Labor have said that we'll allow them to collect a share of the tax penalty, with a reward of up to $250,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you can see that Labor's got a fair-dinkum system and a fair-dinkum policy when it comes to closing some of these tax loopholes, but it relies a lot on some of the measures that have been recommended at an international level through the international organisations that Australia is a member of. It's something that has broad support and that many other nations are now adopting, and it's based on some of those BEPS measures and some of those other international movements that are associated with improving tax transparency and ensuring that there's no leakage from domestic taxation systems and that you maximise the funds and revenue raised to fund services within a budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, this bill has been on the table for many, many years. It's something that Labor has supported for many years. It was in our policy that we took to the last election. It does raise close to a billion dollars over the forward estimates, and it does clear up that discrepancy that exists between foreign-based holding companies and Australian holding companies. We do congratulate the government for finally bringing this on and adopting one of the policies that were put forward by the Labor government in 2013-14. They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery; I thank the minister for imitating Labor's policy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I would like to add a few comments to follow up comments made by the members for Fenner and Kingsford Smith. Firstly, the member for Fenner made the allegation that the coalition's plans to reduce the corporate rate of tax in this nation are budget busting. The member of Fenner should know that every cent of that is already in the budget, and we will have that budget back into balance and then into surplus very soon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the other point that I think needs to be made is that it appears that we have members of the Labor Party that are living in a fool's paradise if they think that we do not have to respond to the US reduction in the rate of corporate tax. The US are reducing their rate of corporate tax to 21 per cent—in the world's largest economy. But they are not the only nation that are reducing their rate of corporate tax. It is also the UK and France. In fact, over the last decade, we have seen almost every major OECD nation reduce their rate of corporate tax. We understand that we as a nation need to be competitive to attract investment and drive jobs growth to drive the prosperity of this nation. Anyone that thinks that we can just sit on our hands and watch our global competitors reduce their corporate rate of tax while we do nothing is living in a fool's paradise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are other risks to our nation's competitiveness. It is not only that the Labor Party does not understand the importance of our corporate rate of tax being internationally competitive. The other threat we have seen in the last 24 hours is the real sovereign risk that comes with the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition. Today's papers are reporting a duplicitous stance by the Leader of the Opposition on the Carmichael coalmine, telling one group of CFMEU workers and those in Northern Queensland that he's in favour of the mine but telling others that he's against it.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. It is clear, as I was saying, that it is important that our nation stays internationally competitive to attract investment. One of the risks to that is the corporate rate of tax, and the opposition are burying their heads in the sand about that. But the other danger is the sovereign risk that has been raised in the last 24 hours, where we have the Leader of the Opposition being duplicitous, saying one thing to one group of people about the Carmichael coalmine up in Northern Queensland—that he's in favour of it—but saying another thing to green, environmental activists—that he will block it; he will revoke their licence. What message does that send to foreign investors who are thinking about bringing to Australia their capital that will help create jobs and wealth and raise revenue for the government to pay for all those things that we want to pay for—for pensions, for aged care, for hospitals, for schools and for kids with disability? We've got to create that wealth and we need to attract that foreign capital. But what would people sitting around a boardroom table overseas think when they pick up the paper today and read that the alternative leader of the Australian nation is so duplicitous that, if he comes to office, he will revoke a licence given out? Who is going to put their capital up, to take the risks, to go through the environmental approvals that take years in this nation, knowing that, if they do everything correctly and by the book, the alternative leader of the government will revoke their licence simply to appease extreme environmentalists and to win green votes in marginal electorates?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a competitive race against nations in the rest of the world. This is why the corporate tax rate is important for our nation. This is why everything this government does is to make sure that our nation stays competitive—because we realise that is the only way we can continue to finance our first-rate hospitals, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, our pensions and our aged care. Those things are so important to this nation and we all want to be able to afford to do that. The only way we can continue to do that is to ensure our nation is internationally competitive in attracting investment—and the greatest threat to that is those members who sit on the opposite side of the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Consolidation Integrity) Bill 2018 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to improve the integrity and operation of the tax consolidation regime. There are around 12,000 consolidated taxpayers in Australia, including the majority of Australia's largest businesses. The consolidation regime allows a wholly owned corporate group to be treated as a single entity for income tax purposes. This not only improves the integrity of the tax system but also reduces compliance costs for businesses and removes impediments to group restructuring and efficient business practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the consolidation regime works well in general, the government is making changes to remove loopholes and improve the fairness and operation of the business tax system. The government is introducing changes to prevent a double tax benefit from arising when an entity holding a deductible liability joins a consolidated group. The bill will also prevent a double tax benefit from arising when an entity joins or leaves a consolidated group where the entity has securitised an asset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To reduce the circumstances in which tax outcomes differ from commercial outcomes, this bill will simplify the operation of the entry and exit tax cost setting rules by ensuring that deferred tax liabilities are disregarded. This bill closes a loophole that allows consolidated groups to access double deductions by shifting value across entities in a consolidated group. Nonresidents will also be prevented from churning assets within related corporation groups to access double deductions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill will ensure that the tax treatment of certain intragroup liabilities and assets between a continuing member of a consolidated group and an existing member of a consolidated group is consistent with the economic substance of the relevant transaction. This will clarify the interaction between the consolidation regime and the taxation of financial arrangements regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have consulted widely over a number of years to ensure that these changes operate as intended and fairly balance the need for additional integrity without unduly burdening business with compliance costs. These changes demonstrate the government's commitment to improving the fairness, integrity and effectiveness of the business tax system. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

And given the nature of the agency, not many people know its mission or the work it has done for the Australian community. So today, as I speak to the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018, I want to share with Australians who are listening the history of our Australian Signals Directorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was formerly the Defence Signals Directorate but changed its name a number of years ago. Prior to the Second World War the Navy, Army and Air Force had independent wireless units and intercept stations that operated and mainly conducted direction-finding activities. There was no central coordination point for those activities. But during the Second World War these independent units were brought together to support the campaign in the Pacific by intercepting and decoding Japanese radio signals. From there the ASD was born. But it took a while before the ASD became the ASD we know today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the war the war-time signals intelligence units were wound down, but government approval was given for a peace-time signals intelligence organisation in 1946. Its role was to exploit foreign communications and be responsible for communications security in the armed services and government departments. This is a role that ASD has maintained to this day, and it's an enduring history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While ASD operated out of Melbourne after the Second World War, its functions only moved to Canberra in the late 1990s. From memory, I think the ASD, or DSD as it was then, was the last Commonwealth government department to move to Canberra as part of the Menzies vision to have federal government agencies serving the federal government here in the nation's capital. I remind those opposite that this was the Menzies vision, the Menzies legacy: to consolidate federal government agencies here in the nation's capital to serve the government of the day. That was the whole idea about Canberra. It took a very long time for all those government agencies to arrive here. ASD, DSD as it was at that point, didn't move here until the 1990s. I remember when I was working in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, working on the Iran and Middle East desk and working in Iran and Iraq I met a number of those DSDers who had moved up here from Melbourne in the 1990s. It was quite a shock for them to move to our nation's capital, but I'm sure, because the nation's capital is just so wonderful, that they now embrace the Canberra way of life. They embrace those beautiful big skies. They embrace the fact that we have the most altruistic community in the country. They embrace the fact that we have the most highly educated community in the country. They embrace all that is wonderful about our wonderful nation's capital. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASD has seen a dramatic expansion of its information security role as a result of the growth of the internet and online activities undertaken by individuals, groups and the government. This saw the creation of one of the first cybersecurity operations centres, in 2010. It was an attempt to understand ICT security threats to Australian systems and to coordinate a response to those threats across government and industry. From there the Australian Cyber Security Centre evolved, bringing together a number of government agencies and cybersecurity functions and capabilities under the one roof in 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, the Independent Intelligence Review made a number of recommendations for ASD, including establishing ASD as a statutory authority within the Defence portfolio and bringing the ACSC into ASD. I had a read of the independent review today, and again I just want to share these facts about the intelligence community with all Australians listening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the report points out, with an annual budget approaching $2 billion and about 7,000 staff spread across 10 agencies, it's clear to us that, on size alone, the Australian government's intelligence activities supporting national security are now a major enterprise—and they are, just from those figures—and would benefit from being managed as such. The report, as I said, talks about the ASD. It talks about the fact that, if these recommendations are followed, the ASD will ensure its capabilities are strengthened in new legislation. The report also recommends that ASD's legislative mandate be amended to explicitly recognise its national responsibilities for cybersecurity, including the provision of advice to the private sector, and that it take formal responsibility for the Australian Cyber Security Centre. This bill is the beginning of the significant reform for ASD based on that review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow assistant minister for cybersecurity and defence, I welcome the reform and the progress being made on the outcomes of the intelligence review as outlined in the bill. The review recognised that the ASD is now a genuinely national asset. As I said before, it plays a much broader role than that defined by its previously exclusive defence focus. This is highlighted in its current additional responsibilities as a national source of information, assurance and cybersecurity. Cybersecurity has become one of the major security issues facing Australia at this time. Throughout the world, this is a significant issue. It comes up as the No. 1 or No. 2 challenge for nations throughout the world, in economic forums, security discussions and intelligence discussions. Between 2015 and 2016, five cyber incidents were reported every hour in Australia, at all levels of society from government to business, large and small, and individual citizens are affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this review recommended new functions for the ASD to help combat cybercrime. These new functions are aimed at preventing and disrupting cybercrime by people and organisations outside Australia, and that in itself is the key point. The new function to proactively identify, disrupt and/or prevent cybercrime is limited to those criminal activities committed by people or organisations outside Australia. It's anticipated that the types of crimes that would be disrupted or prevented could include child exploitation and illicit narcotics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, late last year I met with a group who brought to my attention an issue that sickens me to my core, and that is cyber sex trafficking. It's a form of cyberabuse which involves offenders commissioning the abuse of children in developing countries on a pay-per-view basis. Just talking about it is quite sickening, really, and I'm warning anyone who's listening. For example, somebody jumps on a social media platform like Skype and pays a trafficker, via a wire transfer, to view, via webcam footage transmitted over the internet, a child engaging in sexually explicit acts or posing for sexually explicit photos or videos. The cost of the show to the viewer increases with the level of abuse directed by the viewer. It's just sickening, and most of the victims in this type of cyberabuse are under the age of 12. This is absolutely appalling. It's sickening to talk about it and to hear of the horror faced every day by these children, who are under 12, in developing countries as a result of these sickos—and that's all you can call them—getting on these social media platforms and paying per view to watch a child engaging in sexually explicit acts or posing for sexually explicit photos or videos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not something happening in a faraway land that we can put to the back of our minds and forget about. Australians are making the wire transfers. This is happening in our community today, every day. These are the types of child exploitation activities ASD's new functions will be able to detect, disrupt and prevent—hooray! Providing the ASD with functions to prevent and disrupt cybercrime beyond Australia's borders will help bolster efforts to reduce the impact of what is currently called a 'wild west'. Cybercriminals repeatedly go unpunished for their crimes, and prosecution statistics for cybercrime remain dismally low. The new functions given to the ASD under this bill will help lay the groundwork for a more active approach to protecting the Australian cybersphere and for going after those sickos who engage in that disgusting behaviour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a more local level, bringing the Australian Cyber Security Centre into ASD will mean it is able to communicate more widely with stakeholders at all levels, from small business to critical infrastructure to government agencies. Since gaining the cybersecurity portfolio at the last election, I've had extensive consultation with industry, with think tanks and with academics here and overseas. One of the major issues that keep coming up, particularly for industry here in Australia, is the fact that we need to better connect the engagement between industry and government and, through that, we need to better share information and intelligence gained by the private sector with the government sector. At the moment, industry is telling me that it is sharing some highly sensitive information with the government sector, but unfortunately that isn't being reciprocated by the government sector. It's either too classified or too sensitive, despite the fact that industry is sharing highly classified and highly sensitive information with government agencies. So I'm looking forward to this new arrangement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACSC moved from ASIO to a site that is more penetrable, more accessible, for the private sector, at Brindabella Park. I'm looking forward to seeing the new location and I'm looking forward to seeing the ACSC, in its new guise under this new legislative arrangement, actually fulfil its mission to actively engage in an open, transparent, constructive and trusting way with the private sector, small business, medium business, large business—critical infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also provides for ASD to regularly brief the Leader of the Opposition on Australia's cybersecurity posture, which is a welcome initiative. It enhances transparency and provides an opportunity for clear communication around what is a rapidly changing environment. This bill is currently before a committee, which is due to report back on 21 March, and I'm looking forward to hearing what the committee has to say in terms of the transparency arrangements contained in the bill. I'll also be taking a close look at annual reporting and other arrangements through which we can get a greater understanding of what's actually happening in ASD. ASIO releases an annual report, so it will be interesting to see what transparency mechanisms we have to get an understanding of what's happening in ASD without in any way breaching issues of national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue we grapple with in Defence in gaining an understanding of what's happening on the acquisition front and also on the sustainment front without breaching national security. It's a fine balance, but one to which we should aspire. We need greater accountability and greater transparency around government in general, and I think that applies equally to Defence and ASD. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing this bill does not immediately address, although it goes some way towards it, is what I call the spaghetti junction of overlapping and poorly defined cybersecurity responsibilities. Instead of taking a holistic view of cybersecurity and drawing a thread through all the various government agencies, removing duplication where possible, this government continues the trend of having various agencies responsible for different bits of cybersecurity and operations. We've got the ACMA, the eSafety Commissioner, the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Signals Directorate, the Department of Defence, the Australian Federal Police, the Cyber Security Centre and the Department of Finance. This gives you an idea of the spaghetti junction of responsibilities when it comes to cybersecurity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transfer of the computer emergency response team, CERT, and its functions relating to cyberpolicy and cybersecurity from the Attorney-General's Department to the ASD will help improve capability and information sharing, and I welcome that initiative. But this consolidation is greatly overshadowed by the continued separation of cybersecurity operations and policy following the formation of the Department of Home Affairs. I remind those listening that CERT develops policy—that is acknowledged—but for some reason the government has put cybersecurity policy in Home Affairs, and it's got the operational and the interface elements in ASD, Defence or the ACSC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you have the Special Adviser to the Prime Minister on Cyber Security, Alastair MacGibbon. Poor Alastair! He seems to be responsible to multiple masters. At estimates this week, he said he is now wearing three hats: he is a special adviser to the Prime Minister, so he reports to the Prime Minister on cybersecurity matters; he's also responsible for cybersecurity policy, so he reports to the Minister for Home Affairs on cybersecurity policies; and he's also responsible for the ACSC, so he's involved there. From what I can gather, Alastair MacGibbon spends half his time in the ACSC and half his time in Home Affairs, reporting to the Minister for Defence, reporting to the Minister for Home Affairs and also reporting to the Prime Minister. He's a busy man. I hope he's not expecting to get any sleep for the duration of his contract, because, with those sorts of responsibilities and being pushed and pulled in all those different directions, it's going to be quite exhausting. I don't think the man is going to get any sleep. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is as much streamlining as possible for cybersecurity, communication and also governance, along the lines of the UK. The view amongst some in the intelligence community is that we can't have operations and policy in the same location. For some reason there seems to be this view, which seems to have been around for 30, 40 years in the intelligence community, that we can't have them all under the one roof. I don't know where that view comes from. I don't know from what experience that comes from. But what I have been hearing from others in the intelligence community is that that is oldthink. It is oldthink to separate policy and operations in the intelligence environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the government should be considering putting policy into the ACSC, ensuring that Alastair MacGibbon will at least get some sleep as a result of this position rather than being torn between the two agencies and the Prime Minister as well. Who is Alastair MacGibbon reporting to, and who provides the ultimate tick-off on cybersecurity policy? Is it the Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity? Is it the Minister for Home Affairs? Is it Alastair MacGibbon? Is it the director-general of ASD? There are so many cooks in this area, particularly in cybersecurity policy, that it's going to be a real challenge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage the government to take a close look at the arrangement we've got now. They still have not eliminated the spaghetti junction when it comes to cybersecurity policy, operations, engagement with the community, communication and coordination. There are still way too many players in this space—and just think about poor Alastair, being torn in all those different directions! That said, Labor welcomes the consolidation presented in this bill and hopes it will not stop here. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MARLES:</span>
                    </a>  It was a fine contribution—indeed it was. I rise to speak in favour of this bill. The realm of cyber has been a transformative realm in respect of both the way in which military operations are conducted and the way in which we live our lives in the civilian world. The Australian Signals Directorate, which began its life as the Defence Signals Directorate, came out of the time of the Second World War. Cyberspace has grown into the Australian Signals Directorate's domain, and ASD is now responsible for this most transformative part of military operations and civilian operations. The world in which military conflict is conceived and planned is now dramatically different by virtue of cyberspace. The area of cyberspace is changing the thinking in military affairs as much as any area that is around. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Signals Directorate, therefore, has had to grow as much as any agency: in its scope, in what it seeks to be, and in how it seeks to perform its role. The Australian Signals Directorate is a huge national asset. The work it performs and the people who are working for it do our nation an enormous credit. These are some of the smartest and brightest minds that exist in Australia. And it is an asset that needs to be nurtured, protected and grown in the context of Australian public policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the challenge in doing that is that the role that is being played by the Australian Signals Directorate, whilst it is fundamentally a role based in defence, is now broader than simply defence. That is a function of the way in which the cyber realm has changed the world in which we live. As a result of that, the Australian intelligence review recommended that the Australian Signals Directorate be moved from the Department of Defence and be established as a separate statutory agency. That is a proposition with which Labor agrees, and that is at the heart of the bill before the House right now. That is why we, very much, support this bill as it goes through the House today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That it should become an independent statutory authority is a recognition of a much wider remit in terms of the work that the Australian Signals Directorate is now asked to perform. Crime, for example, is a space in which the Australian Signals Directorate needs to focus its attention, and that goes beyond matters of dealing with the defence of our nation. Because it deals with issues of crime, ASD has to be given, in a legislative sense, a wider remit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also means that the clients of ASD are broader than simply those within the defence space, such as the Defence Force or the Department of Defence. The clients of ASD, those to whom it gives advice and provides services, now stretch across the entire Public Service, but beyond that as well and into the private sector. ASD provides really useful advice to companies, for example, about how they can protect themselves in the cyber realm. Again, establishing ASD as an independent statutory authority gives it a proper legislative base to perform that work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, given that ASD is in that space, attracting the kinds of people that it needs in order to perform all that work requires ASD to be given a degree of flexibility for employment practices. Having ASD taken out of Department of Defence and made an independent statutory authority will give it greater flexibility with the employment of staff. All of that makes sense, and that is what this bill provides. In doing so, it will lift the ASD, if I can put it that way, to the same status as ASIO and other agencies within our intelligence community. That's appropriate as well. It would mean that the Director-General of the Australian Signals Directorate would be at the same level as the directors-general of ASIO and other intelligence agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The oversight arrangements and the reporting arrangements which go with being an independent statutory authority, in our view, also reflect what are appropriate as oversight arrangements and reporting arrangements for a body like this, the Australian Signals Directorate. We welcome the fact that in this bill there will be greater reporting requirements—for example, an obligation to brief the Leader of the Opposition, which has been occurring but would now be a statutory obligation as a result of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has been referred to a Senate inquiry. I think that's important in terms of just getting into the detail of exactly how that reporting and oversight regime ought to apply to the Australian Signals Directorate. It's possible that as a result of that inquiry there will be amendments that come forth out of that process. If they do, we'd consider them in the Senate in the usual way. But, as a matter of principle, this is a bill which deserves support. This is enacting the recommendations of the intelligence review. This is a sensible path forward, and Labor very much supports it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to continue the contributions of my colleagues the shadow defence minister and the member for Canberra, who is obviously passionate about the presence of ASD in Canberra. Labor was proud to have been an active participant in the consideration of this legislation, the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018, through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. That committee is a wonderfully bipartisan committee with very fine members of this House participating, as well as members of the Senate. It is guided by our interests in national security and the national interest. Certainly there's no room for politics in our deliberation, and this was a good step forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm well aware of some of the issues that were occurring at the time—internal issues with ASD and the relationship with some aspects of how that organisation worked within Defence and without. This solution has actually resolved those matters, so I'm very pleased about that. I'm pleased for the personnel within ASD, who are breathing big sighs of relief now that this reform has taken place. It provides some administrative tidying up as well; I won't go into the details of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the remaining issues, of course, relates to the challenge that's being presented to Australia by the technological threats that we face in general and the breadth of those, including in our domestic counterterrorism spaces, where this overlaps with other areas of criminality. One of the things that struck home to me in getting briefings from the AFP was the correlation of paedophilia and some really horrendous aspects of criminality that conflate with terrorist activity and terrorist targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is a huge demand for analysing and sifting through vast amounts of data these days, and there is a really big challenge for us to share the skills and talents that are out there—those people who are great at writing algorithms and managing this data—with private industry. That is going to be the challenge for this nation in the future as our security demands increasingly require those skills in the defence workforce: how we share that with private industry. This was brought home to me by the briefing that we received at the ADF facility at Majura, where there was a PhD student from Data61, who was assisting AFP to sift through what they described as petabytes of material in meeting their challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's pleasing to see that the ADF are working on their own challenges to create the cyberwarriors, the keyboard warriors of the future, and managing how they support these changes to ASD and the broader changes that they are engaged in, such as the creation of the Information Warfare Division. I'm very pleased to see that division has been placed under Major General Thompson, who has a PhD in cybersecurity and a special forces background himself. That brings together not only information warfare capability and C4 issues—command, control, communications and coordination—but also battle management capability.</span>

They are a peaceful people, they are wonderful contributors to our area and I count many of them as friends. I was proud to stand with 23 of them who drove a bus here to Canberra in December to protest against the denial of basic political rights and freedoms in Cambodia. One of the most basic rights is the right to peacefully protest. The non-violent voicing of dissent is a foundation of decent democracies like ours.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was so appalled to hear Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's disgraceful, despicable, deplorable threats of violence against those who will voice their concerns when he visits in March. It's not acceptable for a national leader to say things like, 'I will follow you and beat you at home,' and, 'I will go to your houses and seize you.' This is a guy who has cracked down on media and NGOs in his country, dissolved the opposition party and arrested its leaders. I want to say to the Cambodians in my community and, indeed, right around Australia: you have every right to protest peacefully in this country. On your behalf, we condemn Hun Sen's threats in the strongest possible terms and we stand with you in your struggle for the basic political rights that you and your loved ones are being denied.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I rise today to speak about a Far North Queensland company that is kicking some major goals both domestically and overseas. Mainie Designer Fashion is an Australian owned company with a vision to be recognised internationally as a distinctively Australian fashion and gift brand. Mainie's founders and owners are Cairns based husband-and-wife team Denis Keeffe and Charmaine Saunders, who herself is a proud descendant of the Gunggari people from the Maranoa River region in south-western Queensland. They currently employ nine people, five of whom are local Aboriginal women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mainie is a unique melding of two ancient artisan cultures—one originating from Australia's 60,000-year-old Indigenous arts heritage and the other from the historic silk cities of China where silk making began some 4,700 years ago. In fact, I'm proudly wearing one of Mainie's fantastic ties and pocket handkerchiefs today. I also note that Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, is a huge fan. What makes this Cairns business such a success story is the fact that the artworks featured by Mainie's wearable art pieces are acquired through licensing arrangements with Aboriginal owned and controlled arts centres located on traditional homelands for the artists. Royalties from the sales of Mainie garments are paid quarterly and directly to the Aboriginal artists, including the very talented 2017 National NAIDOC Artist of the Year— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is a very important meeting for Australia. It's a very important meeting for ASEAN. We all hope it's a great success. As part of that ASEAN summit, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, will visit Australia. Hun Sen has recently cracked down on free speech. He has closed down newspapers which are critical of him. He has jailed members of the opposition. Members of the opposition in parliament have been thrown into prison. What's even more concerning than all of that, as concerning as all of that is, is a speech Hun Sen recently gave. I've watched it. It's on YouTube, and I'd encourage honourable members to watch it. In that speech he says that, when he comes to Australia, if there are protests against him or effigies burnt of him he will have people followed to their homes and beaten and seized.</span>

They need to know that this parliament will not put up with that sort of language from anybody, even if they are head of another government, even if they are head of a member of ASEAN. We will stand with the Cambodian Australian community and their right to engage in peaceful protest. We will not see them intimidated. We will not see them harassed. We will not see them bullied. They have people in this House who will stand up for them against all others, including Hun Sen. Even if he is a prime minister, he will not come to our country and behave like that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Last week, the Brisbane Broncos officially opened their new centre of excellence, the Clive Berghofer Centre, in Red Hill, in my electorate of Brisbane. The federal government contributed significant funding towards the facility, further to election commitments that I made during my campaign to support it. I was proud to be there with Minister McVeigh at the official opening. The federal funding helped to ensure that, in addition to having training and coaching facilities, the centre is truly a community facility, one that enhances the lifestyle, amenity and properties of nearby residents. So it included things like the rehabilitation of Ithaca Creek and the local environment, improvements to the surrounding parklands and streetscapes, linkages to walking paths and bike tracks, and a fitness park and a spectator stadium.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important that we continue to support that long-time tradition of families coming down to facilities like these in their spare time and kicking a footy around with their kids. But this isn't just a local facility for Brisbane. The centre allows the Broncos to continue to expand their outreach programs to regional and Indigenous kids right across Queensland who are achieving outstanding results in those programs, helping kids to stay in school and ultimately to finish year 12. There will be about a hundred ongoing jobs at the centre, going forward. It's a great example of how this government can deliver for stronger communities, including in Brisbane.</span>

Let me be absolutely clear: while Hun Sen continues to imprison numbers of Cambodia's pro-democracy movement, while Hun Sen continues to order human rights violations and while Hun Sen continues to suppress the right of Cambodians to participate in free and fair elections then Australians, including Cambodian Australians and including Labor Party members of parliament, will criticise him.</span>

When Hun Sen arrives in Sydney next month he should expect protesters, because Australians do not accept political intimidation. Australia's democratic tradition means we speak out. I speak out to call on Hun Sen to end the oppression of journalists and human rights activists, and to pursue reforms that respect the rights of his people and respect fundamental principles of free democracy, and I call on the Turnbull government to make these points clearly and firmly right now, as well as at the ASEAN summit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Far and away the biggest problem faced by the entire community on the Northern Beaches is transport. The Wakehurst Parkway is a vital transportation artery on the Northern Beaches, yet the parkway is flooded and closed at least three or four times a year. With the increasing pace of development on the peninsula, the construction of Northern Beaches Hospital and the need for emergency access despite regular flooding near Middle Creek, the parkway needs to be widened from North Narrabeen to Seaforth and flood-proofed. Dredging Middle Creek and raising and widening roadways are on the table, but the parkway simply needs to be rebuilt, including all the bridges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal state government provided $5 million in preliminary funding to help the council find practical actions to minimise siltation and to improve water flows to prevent flooding. Works to clear the build-up of sand, vegetation and other debris which restrict the flow of Middle Creek are the start of potential future works on the parkway. For Northern Beaches residents dependent on the parkway for access to the new hospital and travel to the city, the present rate of closure is simply unacceptable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The Tasmanian health system is in crisis. Judy from Devonport needs neurosurgery. She has a low volume of brain fluid, with her brain sitting on top of her spine, causing stroke-like symptoms and chronic migraines. Once fiercely independent, Judy now spends most of her time in her home and rarely leaves. She was to receive her surgery in May last year. After that time, she asked me and the state Labor leader, Rebecca White, for help. Our collective pleas for a surgery date were ignored by the Liberal government. The health minister finally wrote back to Judy in December, saying, 'Yes, I understand you're waiting longer than what is clinically acceptable,' and then signed his letter: 'And I hope you get better soon.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only after the intervention by the member for Sydney and Labor leader Rebecca White at the height of the election campaign that the Tasmanian Liberal government took notice. So how did we get their attention? After Judy fronted every single Tasmanian media outlet last Wednesday, she poured out her heart not just for herself but for every other Tasmanian waiting and suffering too long for surgery. She got a call on Friday, with the surgery date of the next two to three weeks. This Liberal government only acts in response to bad publicity, never in the interests of Tasmanians who are suffering. So I say to all Tasmanians waiting for surgery: get to your media today, before Saturday's election, and you might actually get your surgery.</span>

Our volunteers make an incredible contribution, with the Sturt CFS Group brigades responding to around 260 emergency incidents per year, including bushfires, domestic fires and motor vehicle accidents. The CFS also plays an important role in educating our community by providing materials and advice to ensure we are all aware of the risks and can respond to emergencies. On behalf of the community in my electorate of Boothby, I offer my sincere thanks to each and every dedicated CFS volunteer for the work they do in keeping us all safe.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  The people in my electorate are incredibly resourceful. If they see an opportunity they grasp it with both hands and run with it. For example, last year Kangaroo Island artists put together a travelling exhibition of their work to give us a glimpse of island life. The Island to Inland exhibition toured regional galleries across South Australia—except Kangaroo Island because there wasn't a suitable venue. In response to the lack of a venue, the artists have launched a crowdfunding campaign to kickstart their vision to build a regional gallery on Kangaroo Island. To do the art museum justice, they need $20,000 for the planning phase. In two weeks they have raised more than $15,000, but they're not there yet. Art makes us feel, it makes us think, it takes us places. I have no doubt that they will reach their target. I urge the people of Australia, particularly the people of South Australia, to visit the group's campaign on the not-for-profit crowdfunding site StartSomeGood. Kangaroo Island's art community is one of Kangaroo Island's best-kept secrets. With its own art museum, this community has the opportunity to make artists as well-known as the island's wild pristine landscape and wonderful produce that the rest of the world comes to enjoy.</span>

Recently the community of Oberon came together for the 118th Oberon show and it was another outstanding success. There is a tremendous amount of work that goes into a country show, and today I would like to thank and acknowledge the members of the Oberon Show Society for their wonderful community work. They include President Nick Wills, Vice-President Yvette Wills, Secretary Anna Shaw and Treasurer Glen Stewart. I also acknowledge committee members John Brotchie; Amy Curran; Marj Whalan, who is also the president of the show society ladies auxiliary; Lynne Butterfield, who is also the vice-president of the auxiliary; Barry Webb; Darrell O'Connor; and Hugh Webb, who was presented with a life membership of the Oberon Show Society for his hard work and dedication to the organisation with over 39 years of service. Well done, Hugh. I also acknowledge hardworking committee members Scott Austen, Peter Armstrong, Aaron Booth and Mark Shaw. I would like to further acknowledge the show society ladies auxiliary members. They include secretary and treasurer Gail Conley and publicity offer Katrina Whalan. I would also like to thank Wayne Barker, who did an excellent job in opening the show. I conclude by paying tribute to the community of Oberon and its surrounding districts. It is their support, generosity and community spirit that have sustained the Oberon show for 118 years and made it the remarkable success that it is. Its future is assured. Congratulations, Oberon; you just can't beat a country show!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Tasmania's health crisis, sadly, continues. It continues because of the cuts from the federal Liberal government and the state Liberal government. Today there are reports, sadly, about mental health patients. There are at least six mental health patients currently inside the Royal Hobart Hospital emergency department waiting for beds on the psychiatric ward. Indeed, some of them have been there for 117 hours, 91 hours, 61 hours, 50 hours, 40 hours and 35 hours. One unwell person was told on Saturday that she was too unwell to go home, and here we are on Wednesday and there is still no bed for her.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is only the state Labor Party that has said it will fund more psychiatric beds at the Royal Hobart Hospital. We know that Tasmanians who need support and are currently in crisis need those beds. It's only state Labor that will fund them and staff them. State Labor has made a commitment to funding and staffing more psychiatric beds because, of course, Tasmania does not have the recommended number of psychiatric beds per 1,000 people. We're the only state that doesn't. The only way people are going to get any assistance is if they vote Labor this Saturday.</span>

Over the past year, 30 chaplains based at 32 public schools in my electorate of Moore conducted approximately 6,142 counselling sessions with students, parents, carers and school staff relating to family relationships, behavioural concerns, peer relationships and mental health. Young people face a range of pressures in our community, with issues such as bullying, depression, and alcohol and drug use commonly encountered. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">YouthCARE chaplains assisted at-risk students with limited family support to overcome the obstacles to furthering their education by serving more than 400 meals at breakfast clubs; conducting social, emotional and physical programs; and providing mentoring to students attending lunchtime groups. Adequate resourcing is required to deliver these valuable services into the future. Security of tenure is also important to chaplains in terms of their employment contracts. I strongly advocate for continued government funding of YouthCARE in the budget forward estimates. Immeasurable benefits to society are achieved when at-risk youth are constructively engaged in learning and complete their education. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Tasmanians go to the polls this Saturday. The Tasmanian public health system is in crisis. Full responsibility for the Tasmanian health crisis rests with the incompetent Liberal government led by Will Hodgman and also with the Prime Minister's cuts to health. It's impossible to consider the pressures facing the Tasmanian hospital system without considering the social determinants of health. All of the social determinants of health point towards poorer health outcomes in Tasmania, particularly in the electorate of Braddon and my electorate of Bass. This means that there needs to be more investment in public health and preventive health, more investment in education and more attention to transforming the Tasmanian economy. Instead, Tasmanians face increased waiting lists for elective surgery, rising out-of-pocket costs for seeing a GP, and state and federal governments who think that the health budgets can be constrained by decree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate 2,006 people are waiting for elective surgery. Many more are waiting for appointments just to see specialists before they go on the list. The average GP out-of-pocket cost paid by people in Bass is $34.80. Many people will skip necessary treatment and will attend our overburdened emergency departments. Labor has committed at the state and federal levels to reducing the waiting lists by funding over 1,000 extra surgeries at the Launceston General Hospital alone. Labor built Medicare. Labor understands our public health system and knows how to fix it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  A recent study by the CSIRO found the south-west coast of Australia, which includes Western Australia, is home to 1,460 adult great white sharks. By contrast, there are only 750 adult great white sharks on the east coast, half the number of those in the south-west. This report confirms that WA is the shark capital of Australia, yet in his response to the report the WA Labor fisheries minister, Dave Kelly, didn't acknowledge that WA has more than double the number of great whites of the east. Why won't the WA fisheries minister acknowledge that WA is more home to great whites than the east coast is? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If he can't acknowledge even the facts of the report, we can't expect him to come up with decent policy solutions. WA Labor have been flat-footed on this issue. Their shark mitigation strategy is limited to personal deterrence and drones. Personally, I support the reintroduction of commercial shark fishing, which would sustainably reduce great white numbers over time. We already manage other fish stocks this way, so why should great whites be different? I call on the WA Labor fisheries minister, Dave Kelly, to acknowledge the facts, stop talking and start acting. With 15 fatal shark attacks in the last 17 years, it's time to consider all options. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I stand here today to speak with those many thousands of good Tasmanians who consider themselves loyal Liberal Party voters. I stand here to say this to the loyal Liberal voters of Tasmania: you may never have voted Labor before and you may never vote Labor again, but this Saturday, if you want poker machines out of our community clubs and pubs, you must vote Labor. I know I ask no small thing. As a lifelong Labor voter, I cannot imagine what it would take for me to vote anything other than Labor. I appreciate and respect those who consider themselves Liberal voters. Like me, they are wedded to their values and principles. I know that many Liberal voters in Tasmania are concerned about the spread of pokies through our state. I know that many Liberal voters in Tasmania share my view that the spread of pokies is harmful to our wider community and to many individuals caught in their deliberately addictive grip. My exhortation to Liberals who want pokies out is simply this: this opportunity to get them out will never come again. If you vote Liberal on Saturday, the pokies will be there forever. This Saturday is our state's one and only chance to get them out. Only a Rebecca White Labor government will have the courage to stand up to the pokie barons and get pokies out of community pubs and clubs. </span>

It's a terrific reminder of the massive boost in funding our government is delivering to schools across Corangamite and the nation. We're delivering record schools funding—an extra $23.5 billion over 10 years—under our Gonski 2.0 plan. Students most in need, such as those in regional and disadvantaged areas, will receive more funding and sooner. Bellbrae will receive a 57 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding over 10 years. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a pity the member for Corio is not capable of telling the truth about this issue. In true form, he's once again misled the <span style="font-style:italic;">Geelong Advertiser</span>. Prior to the 2013 federal election, the Liberals committed to the first four years of Labor's school funding model on a unity ticket, and that's what we have delivered. There was no broken pre-election pledge, as Mr Marles claims. Labor's figures were pie in the sky and never delivered. Across the Corangamite and Corio electorates, funding for government and independent schools will increase by $24.3 million in 2021 and another $66 million in 2027. I'm pleased that the concerns of the Catholic schools sector are being addressed. Shame on the member for Corio for voting against this massive funding boost for his schools. </span>

The member for Dickson, the Minister for Home Affairs, tried lamely to smear the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. He did so in this place in a cheap parody of a landmark moment delivered at the dispatch box by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It is known as the misogyny speech. Some say impersonation can be seen as a form of flattery, but I would assert that when the easily roasted, the thin-skinned, try to replicate a withering master, it always ends in a mash-up, a cheap parma and chips, if you like, trying to dress up as cordon bleu. </span>

I repeat: 'workplaces where women are respected'. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, Senator Cash used the protection of Senate estimates to launch a disgraceful attack on the young women working in this building. It was an unprovoked attack from a minister under pressure. Today, the minister for jobs attacked young women doing their jobs. Today, the Minister representing the Minister for Women smeared young women. Being a staffer in this place is hard enough. Like so many of my colleagues, I am very lucky to have smart young women working for me. On their behalf, I am offended. Senator Cash's comments were ghastly; they were sexist. They were a 1950s style throwback. And they were a reflection on women working for all political parties. Eventually, the senator offered a conditional apology—one of those mealy-mouthed weasel apologies—if anyone was offended. The Prime Minister should make her offer a proper apology to all of the young women she has offended. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged between five and 17. This is not acceptable and we must do what we can to stop this tragedy. Last week, I had the privilege of launching the Way Back Support Service at Redcliffe Hospital. Up to one-quarter of those who attempt suicide will try again within three months of leaving hospital. The Way Back Support Service is critical during this three-month time frame and addresses a significant gap in the current service system. The coalition government has funded $800,000 towards this service, with plans to roll it out into other parts of the country. The service is free and is offered to all people, regardless of circumstance. </span>

There were 403,000 jobs created last year, the largest number in our history. There were 16 consecutive months of jobs growth, the longest run of jobs growth ever recorded. But we want to create more jobs and more better paid jobs, and we want to get more Australians into work, especially those who are unemployed. Those of us on this side of the House know that the best form of welfare is a job. Members opposite may disagree, but we believe every Australian should have the opportunity to experience the dignity and stability of a job. We believe every Australian should have that opportunity, and that's why our growth plan and our economic plan are pro-growth, pro-investment and pro-jobs. And it's working. Not only have we had record jobs growth; there are now fewer Australians on welfare than at any time in the last 20 years. That's because of initiatives like our PaTH program for young people, lower business taxes, our Wage Subsidy Scheme, and just getting the long-term unemployed back into work. </span>

Yet, at the same time, he says he cares about jobs and the economy, just like he told the workers at Oaky that they had no better friend than him and he would always do the right thing by them.

Labor hates private health insurance, and it gets worse. Here's the context. Let me quote from the Leader of the Opposition just a couple of weeks ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the big health insurers are making profits of 25 per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is what APRA said. This is from the very body that has just been quoted by the hapless shadow health minister. APRA said not 25 per cent, not 20 per cent, not 15 per cent and not 10 per cent. APRA said in their most recent report they had a 5.5 per cent net margin. The Leader of the Opposition inflated it not once, twice, three times or four times but nearly five times. He has been caught out with a shameless fabrication.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, better still, what did APRA, the very body named by the hapless shadow health minister, also say following Labor's recent comments about private health? It said, 'It is very much in the community's interests that the current reform process continues,' referring to what this government has done in delivering the lowest change in private health insurance in 17 years, lower than every single year under Labor. Then, devastatingly for the ALP, APRA went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">APRA does not consider industry profits or capital levels to be the primary drivers of rising premiums.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a bunch of frauds they are on the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse still, though, for all of their hate of private health, for all of their fraudulent position, those opposite have a proposal to slash the rebate and drive up private health insurance costs by 16 per cent. At the end of the day, they're private health frauds and they're medi-frauds. The member for Sydney said it absolutely best last time—'Everything I did, I did by targeting private health insurance.'</span>

Last night, we saw a bit more of the inspiration that Labor are seeking and finding into how they're driving their economic policies. Last night the member for Scullin got up in the adjournment debate. He was revelling in the latte left's new custodian status of economic policy in the Labor Party. He was boasting how Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders were now what was inspiring the Labor Party and that's why voters in Batman should be voting for the Labor Party and the Corbyn-Sanders ticket there. It's no longer Hawke and Keating; it's Corbyn and Sanders who are driving economic policy in the Labor Party!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the shadow Treasurer's excuse that he uses around the place to hide his backflip, his contradiction, his turning of his back on his previous position on company taxes, is that the tax cuts are unfunded. The Parliamentary Budget Office set this straight when they pulled the rug out from under the shadow Treasurer's argument when they stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The fact that the budget baseline is improving is reflected in the most recent MYEFO … and … that includes the company tax cuts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the deputy leader opposite, that means it's fully funded. Today the Secretary to the Treasury equally pointed this out very clearly when he said of the tax cuts: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have put the … tax cuts, obviously, in the forward estimates. We have also put them into our estimates for the longer term. They're fully funded … </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from the Treasury secretary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that responsible budgeting requires you to fully fund the things that you're doing, and that's what we've done in our budget. But there is another thing that you also have to do. The shadow Treasurer has raised this issue of underfunded commitments. The PBO, very importantly, pointed out something else this week. Senator Smith asked the PBO whether the Labor Party had booked the savings from the full reversal of the company tax cut yet had still blown out the budget by $16 billion at the last election. The PBO said, 'That is correct.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means is this: as you would know, Mr Speaker, just to pay for the spending promises they made at the last election, they will have to fully reverse all of the company tax cuts. But it also means this: all the money from their proposal to reverse the tax cuts is fully spent. So when they were up in Townsville last week, when they were up in North Queensland—even when they were in Melbourne talking about tram extensions—and they were claiming some $300 million in new expenditure and that it was funded from reversing the company tax cuts, that was a lie. Every time you hear Labor say they are funding new expenditure from reversing the company tax cuts, it is a lie.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition used to say that. They're experiencing that now in the United States. The member for McMahon wrote a book about it. It is hardly rocket science. It has been the universal experience. That is why governments in the past of both the Labor persuasion and the coalition persuasion have reduced business taxes, and we've seen that result. That is how you drive jobs and jobs growth.</span>

But what we've seen is a complete backflip by the Leader of the Opposition. He stood with the workers at Oaky North and, with the member for Gorton, he told them that he supported them. Tony Maher stood up and said, 'Bill Shorten is very pro coalmining, and I can tell you that from personal experience.' Tony Maher said that to those workers on the picket line while standing next to the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

Thanks to Senator Patrick's order for the production of documents, we now know that the federal government paid more than twice the market price for water buybacks in the Warrego catchment, paying $1,600 a megalitre versus payment of around $720 a megalitre for similar licences in the same region. Can the minister explain why more than twice the commercial rate was paid and why the independent valuations were redacted? Is the minister aware of any relationships or friendships or conflicts of interest between the beneficiaries of the water buybacks in the Warrego catchment and the former or current minister for water resources? </span>

It is quite obvious. Let me say around the pricing that was put in place, it is always at arm's length from the government. In fact, I was not even the minister when those negotiations took place. So if you're here to try and character assassinate me in some cheap attempt to score some political points in South Australia, well, you destroyed the Basin Plan, along with the Labor Party! This was their plan. This was their review. </span>

He's not only popular in his own electorate but obviously very popular in here, too, as he should be. He's a hard worker. He's a fighter. He's a fighter in his electorate for local jobs, for infrastructure, for the resources sector, for his people and for regional Australia. He knows, we know, that infrastructure investment and private sector investment stimulates local economies and creates local jobs, and our government is delivering. It's cutting taxes—the lowest company tax rate since 1940. It's cutting red tape—$5.8 billion of red tape slashed each and every year under the Liberals and Nationals. Building local infrastructure—that's what we're delivering. As well, 403,000 jobs last year equates to 1,100 jobs a day, many of them full-time employees.</span>

What does the member for Herbert think about this? What's she doing? Is she supporting these local jobs? When youth unemployment in Townsville is running above 20 per cent, is she fighting for these local jobs? Is the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Maribyrnong, fighting for these local jobs? No way. Not this bloke. There's only one job he's fighting for and that's his own. He has gone from the faceless man to the two-faced man. He and his mates are still wielding their knives, though, aren't they, albeit butterknives? </span>

It's a similar story for the workers at Clean Event. The workers of Queensland can't trust him. The workers in Batman can't trust him. And the people in Queensland can't trust him. So, if they can't trust him—and nor can the union members who he purports to represent—how can the people of Australia trust the member for Maribyrnong? </span>

I'm glad we got a Dorothy Dixer on energy, because it's been more than 130 days since the member for Port Adelaide and Labor have asked a question on energy. Do you think that is because when Labor was last in office energy prices doubled? Then we got the carbon tax, the citizens' assembly and the cash for clunkers and we saw network prices skyrocket as the gold-plating took place. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has now asked for a national solution. He asked us to listen to the experts and he said that he wanted a bipartisan approach. But when the Energy Security Board came forward with the National Energy Guarantee, which independent modelling shows will leave the average Australian household $300 a year better off than they would be under the Labor Party, he turns his back. Today, on the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian Financial Review</span>, we see Andrew Liveris, a proud Australian and the head of Dow Chemical—somebody who knows a thing or two about creating jobs, because he employs nearly 100,000 people—saying that the states need to get behind the National Energy Guarantee and that the Labor Party needs to get behind the National Energy Guarantee as a means of creating jobs and investment certainty. The other thing that Andrew Liveris says is that it is time to stop those blanket bans and moratoriums on gas development that you see across Labor states. In the state of Victoria, Daniel Andrews is not only locking up unconventional gas but also locking up onshore conventional gas.</span>

We've seen, as a direct result of this government's export policies opening up the world's best preferential market access for Aussie exporters, that we are a government that have delivered in spades when it comes to jobs—403,000 jobs delivered by this government by creating the right economic conditions, much of it driven by access to new export markets. So it's a critical part of what we as a government are focused on.</span>

The reason that we have been able to secure our borders, the reason that we've been able to get out of detention the 8,000 children that Labor put into detention, the reason that we've been able to close 17 detention centres that Labor opened and the reason that we haven't had deaths at sea, whereas under Labor there were 1,200 deaths at sea, is that we have been able to put in place the policies, we have shown the strength of character and we've had the resolve to maintain a position that has resulted in that humane outcome.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the people smugglers look for is strength of character and what they look for is consistency of position. We have had consistency of position in staring down people smugglers, as the Howard government did. It was clear to the people smugglers that Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard both failed the character test and failed to take the position that should have been adopted—they walked away from it. Speaking of people who are walking away and failing the character test, the Leader of the Opposition walks away whenever this topic is raised because he doesn't like the inconvenience of the facts. The fact is that this Leader of the Opposition fails the character test on a number of fronts. We know that this Leader of the Opposition, for example, said at the time that he stood up for workers, but as it turned out the workers were dudded by this Leader of the Opposition when he was head of the union that was accepting payments from employers, and it turned out that the workers got ripped off. That's the reality.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the character test again that this Leader of the Opposition fails, we see him standing up in this place criticising the Prime Minister for living at Point Piper, yet we know that on a regular basis he is sipping Cristal in the homes of billionaires around the country and he's got his knees up on private jets flying from one side of the country to the other. We know that, when he's in Queensland, the Leader of the Opposition is accepting hospitality—</span>

He cannot maintain a position, because he does not have the strength of character. The fact is that, when it comes to border protection, you need to stare down the threat of people smugglers.

Yet this Leader of the Opposition turns up to their rallies and says he'll rip up the IR laws that the Labor Party introduced and that we have added to. He welcomes them into the factional deals in the ALP fora in Victoria. He allows them to help preselect candidates. He allows them to help set policy.

Yet the shadow Attorney-General and the shadow minister for justice are supposed to oversight that union if they should ever grace these benches again. It is disgraceful. If we're talking about conflicts of interest, the member for Isaacs and the shadow minister for justice should be demanding the CFMEU get thrown out of the forums of the Labor Party, not doing grubby factional deals with them. </span>

Before I return to that, I'll just note that the Turnbull government last week announced that it would lead a national plan on elder abuse. It's the first of its kind and it builds on the 2016 election commitment of the Prime Minister, where $15 million was committed as a critical foundation to protecting the rights of older Australians. The national plan was the capstone recommendation of the Law Reform Commission's 2017 report into elder abuse. It's important for everyone on our and on the other side's benches to understand that there couldn't be any national plan, which we've committed to lead, without that 2016 commitment of money from the Prime Minister, because that is developing the research base that allows us to proceed with a national plan. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australia does not know but will soon know is the frequency, scale and context of elder abuse. Other studies overseas have indicated that elder abuse can affect up to 12 per cent of the older population. In Australia we know that a quarter of all Australians will be over 65 by the middle of the century, but we are only just starting to understand how prevalent elder abuse is. Some studies have indicated, for instance, that about 40 per cent of elder abuse occurs in the financial context—things such as duress, undue pressure and fraud. But, as I noted at the beginning of this answer, there are very timely reasons for knowing and understanding that physical abuse of elders is occurring in Australia and that a national plan is warranted. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put before the House three quotes from Bruce Lander QC's report on Oakden in South Australia, which I think summarised the astonishingly terrible situation that has developed there. He said first:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The consumers who resided at the Oakden Older Persons Mental Health Service (Oakden Facility) were some of the most frail and vulnerable persons in our community. They did not have a voice. They were obliged to live in a facility which could only be described as a disgrace, and in which they received very poor care. The process and procedures were such that they were forgotten and ignored.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He then went on to say of the South Australian Labor ministers:</span>

We are spending considerable amounts of money in South Australia. In fact, the investment is $3,439 million. And, whilst we're talking about spending and spending in infrastructure, Labor's average annual infrastructure spend was $6.05 billion. That's impressive, that's good—I'll give you that—but it's $2.1 billion less per year than the coalition's $8.14 billion annual average spend as part of our record $75 billion spend in infrastructure. Labor can cherrypick the figures until, as my late father would say, the cows come home, but the inescapable fact is that our record $75 billion infrastructure investment is delivering more than Labor ever did in South Australia or any other state.</span>

In particular, I know that, like many people, he was distressed when power was lost at the Port Augusta Hospital due to the incompetence of the South Australian government. It joins the long list of South Australian hospitals to have the lights turned out: Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Flinders Medical Centre, Mount Gambier and so many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, we have been investing whilst they have been failing. At this level, across South Australia, we've invested a 26 per cent increase in support for South Australian hospitals—a 26 per cent increase, whilst the Weatherill government increased South Australian expenditure by six per cent over that same period. In the last full financial year, they decreased health expenditure by $7½ million. That's the reality of what is happening under Labor. It compares with the investment that we have put in and it compares with the growth which, in the member's own electorate, is even larger than the state average. Whereas our contribution has been an increase of 26 per cent on average across South Australia, within the member for Grey's electorate the local hospital district has seen a 31½ per cent increase in funding under us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see there is a very clear statement of commitment to health, commitment to funding and reliability under us, compared to not just an utter failure of investment but a complete failure to be able to keep the lights on in South Australian hospitals. This isn't trivial; this is fundamentally significant. It goes to a test of competence as a government, competence as economic managers and competence as people running a medical system.</span>

I refer to the government's own budget papers for his own portfolio, which show that federal infrastructure investment in Tasmania will fall from $174 million this financial year to $53 million in 2019-20. Is this a reflection of the fact that not a single new federally funded major infrastructure project has been commenced under either the Abbott-Joyce, Turnbull-Joyce or Turnbull-McCormack governments?</span>

                  </a>  The Carpenters once said, 'We've only just begun.' Certainly when I say that we've only just begun I could talk about the Midland Highway in Tasmania—$400 million over 10 years and 234 jobs. That's what this government's all about: jobs. There were 403,000 jobs in infrastructure created last year—1,100 a day—and many of them full-time and many of them thanks to the good policies of the Will Hodgman government. May they be re-elected this Saturday! There's $38 million towards the Hobart International Airport runway extension. The coalition has already made a significant, $150 million, commitment to UTAS for the relocation and expansion of campuses: in Launceston, $130 million; and in Burnie, $20 million. I had dinner with Brett Whiteley last night and he was talking about the hope and optimism in Tasmania. We didn't see that when Labor were in power either federally or statewide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I say again, for Tasmanians watching this broadcast: vote 1 for the Will Hodgman government this Saturday. As part of the Hobart City Deal, the Commonwealth is working on potential innovative financing solutions to support the university's presence in the city. That should please Tasmanians. I'm sure the member for Denison, who is absent, would be pleased. But, more than that, there's the freight rail revitalisation project, with $59.8 million in government funding, and the Hobart airport interchange, with $24 million. We are ensuring less congestion and better road safety—all the things that Tasmanians want. We're doing it federally and the Will Hodgman government is doing it in the state. May he be re-elected with his very good government this Saturday.</span>

He's part of a government where every single policy is supporting jobs and growth, and we're delivering on jobs—403,000 last year. Every lever of policy is pulling in the direction of more economic growth, more jobs and better jobs. Australians know that—whether it is talking about the National Energy Guarantee, as the minister for energy spoke about, or our business tax cuts, as the Treasurer has spoken about, or our infrastructure investments, as the Deputy Prime Minister has talked about, or defence industry and the massive investments, as the minister has spoken about—everything is pulling in the same direction and we're seeing results. That's what you get with consistent policy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member asks me about alternatives. I regret to say that we are seeing a shocking alternative at the moment, presented by the two-faced Leader of the Opposition. This is the man who only a few years ago said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth, and leads to more jobs and higher wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what he said then, but he's thrown all that out. And the member for McMahon, who still hankers after our economic common sense, said only a few weeks ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… when the Budget has returned to surplus then you can look at further tax reform for both personal and company tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the greatest inconsistency that we've seen, the worst alternative we've seen, is the most recent. We go back to the middle of last year, when the Leader of the Opposition told Senator Hanson that he was pro-coal. Bill Shorten said to her face, she says, that he, the Leader of the Opposition, was pro-coal, unlike others within Labor. Then, on 6 October, standing shoulder to shoulder with the member for Gorton, spewing at the injustice, he said, 'We support you, we support you,' and Tony Maher from the CFMEU said, 'Bill Shorten is very pro coalmining.' And now we know. Now he has a little deal, a little secret deal with Geoff Cousins, who also has a connection to the NBN, I'm sure—he's just around the corner from me in Point Piper. Geoff Cousins spent thousands of dollars taking the Leader of the Opposition up to the Great Barrier Reef—snorkelling, charter flights; oh, it was a beautiful sight—and he gave an undertaking to Geoff Cousins. He said, 'When Labor is in government, if the evidence is as compelling as we presently believe it to be, we will revoke— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I also refer to evidence at Senate estimates just now from Minister Cash that both she and the minister for the workplace are responsible for administering the Fair Work Act. Is this another example of the chaos of this government, where ministers don't even know what they're in charge of? Or did the Prime Minister only make the decision to remove Senator Cash's responsibility today and not tell her?</span>

And I have to say, the member for Gorton from time to time benefits from the incidental association with the great member for O'Connor. In the member for O'Connor's electorate, you've got plenty of miners, and they know they have got a member who defends them—not like this member for Gorton here. He stood up with the Leader of the Opposition and Tony Maher and said to those workers that they were pro-coal, that they were supporting them. But little did he know that his leader was taking thousands of dollars from a Point Piper millionaire no less, going off on a trip to the Barrier Reef, snorkelling, flying around in charter jets—but it wasn't meant to come out.</span>

                  </a>  The Fair Work Act has been breached again and again by the CFMEU—breached again and again, millions of dollars of fines. And there were the member for Gorton and the Leader of the Opposition encouraging those workers, those members of the CFMEU, in their vile threats against workers that were going in there and doing their jobs. But what they didn't know was that the Leader of the Opposition—and the member for Gorton, no doubt, because he backs his Leader of the Opposition to the hilt, I'm sure; the hilt or the butterknife—was getting ready to cancel the Adani licence. And the legal grounds were all set out by Geoff Cousins, and one of them related to new information about the offsets for the endangered black-throated finch. How would the workers at Oaky have responded if the Leader of the Opposition had said, 'black-throated finches of the world unite'? I don't think they would have been very impressed. He sold their jobs down the river to get green votes and, of course, a nice holiday on the Barrier Reef.</span>

Anyone who has listened to his maiden speech or other contributions in this parliament knows that he has a very personal interest in the welfare space. As all members know, this government is creating 1,100 jobs a day. We want to make sure that everyone in society who can work is taking advantage of this unprecedented economic growth. We also want to make sure that welfare payments aren't subsidising drug dealers. Today the government reintroduced legislation where we will seek to implement a trial to help people who are suffering from substance abuse problems get off welfare, get treatment, get rehabilitation and get a job. We're doing this because research has shown that one of the worst barriers to getting a job is substance abuse. As the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's 2016 National Drugs Strategy Household Survey has shown, illicit drug use is more prevalent amongst the unemployed than amongst the employed. Those who are unemployed are three times as likely to use methamphetamines.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the drug-testing trial is complemented by the government's other substance abuse measures. This includes a measure where, for the first time, jobseekers are able to undertake drug or alcohol treatment as an approved activity in their job plan. Since the commencement of this measure, on 1 January, 259 jobseekers have had drug or alcohol treatment included in their job plan. We want to make sure that we're helping people to help themselves. We want to make sure that we're putting the policies in place that mean people have a real opportunity, a real chance, to benefit from the jobs growth that we are seeing in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All our measures, when it comes to the economy, are about jobs growth or economic growth. When it comes to those of a working age, we want to make sure that all our measures are helping all those people, especially those less fortunate who are suffering from substance abuse, whether it be drug abuse or alcohol abuse, to benefit from this unprecedented jobs growth. I say to those opposite: I would like to work with you to get this trial up and running. We've got $1 million for an evaluation so we can get it right, because we want to help everyone benefit from the 1,100 jobs a day we are creating.</span>

Is this fruit fly outbreak the fault of the Tasmanian government, the federal government or both?</span>

So the question may be better directed to Daniel Andrews and the Labor government in Victoria. How do you not understand biosecurity in this nation? You have failed the people of Tasmania. You don't understand the biosecurity measures that are taking place in this nation. In fact, we as a government have put in $200 million extra under the competitive ag white paper that the member for New England instigated. We as a federal government only this year put $9 million into fruit fly measures to ensure that there is better detection of fruit fly, and the Hodgman government put in $2 million as soon as there was an incursion. That's what a real government does. They act, they prepare and, when there is an incursion, they make sure that there are results. </span>

Today the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer announced a compulsory recall of Takata airbags based on a recommendation of the ACCC, following an extensive safety investigation in August 2017 and consultation with affected manufacturers, industry stakeholders and international experts. This is one of the largest recalls in the nation's history, with a total of four million cars, around two in every seven vehicles on Australian roads, affected by defective airbags. The compulsory recall will capture around 2.3 million vehicles that still have a defective airbag that needs replacement, including one million vehicles that have not yet received a replacement under the existent voluntary recalls. This notice requires all vehicle suppliers to recall and replace defective Takata airbags in their vehicles by 31 December 2020. Importantly for customers, vehicle manufacturers will be required to cover the full cost of replacing these airbags. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety of all Australians is the No. 1 priority of this government, not just on issues of national security but on issues of consumer security as well, and all matters of public security. Absolute priority will be given to replacing the alpha airbags, which pose an immediate and critical safety risk. Priority will also be given to airbags assessed as high-risk based. If a vehicle is recalled, an owner can contact their local dealer or manufacturer to book in a time to have their airbag replaced. We advise and implore all Australians not to ignore or delay responding to letters from the vehicle manufacturer asking to have airbags replaced and to contact the ACCC if they experience any difficulties or delays in obtaining a replacement airbag. I commend the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer for his initiative in this regard. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  There are actually only five sitting days left before the Treasurer will deliver the 2018 federal budget—and that's if the budget date doesn't change without the Treasurer knowing it again, but, working on the published schedule, that is the case. Australians would hope and expect that their government brings down a budget which helps them with their concerns. In my experience, Australians are very understanding. They don't expect miracles from government. Australians don't expect the government to fix all their problems. Australians don't expect the government to wave a magic wand and improve their lives overnight. But Australians expect a government which understands their problems and tries to help them deal with the challenges in their lives, not make things harder for them. Australians want a government that's dealing with low wages growth and with concerns about job insecurity, casualisation and rising inequality in Australia. They want a government that actually gets these things and knows that there are policies that can be put in place which make a contribution to helping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has got answers and it's got policies which no doubt we'll see again in the federal budget. They've got an answer on low wages growth: that is, to stand aside and let people who work on the weekend have a wages cut. That's the policy of this government. That's their answer to low wages growth: to actually reduce people's wages. And it gets worse. Their other answer to people on low and middle incomes who are worrying about where the wages growth is going to come from and how they're going to make ends meet to match their cost-of-living increases is that they want a tax rise for them. Anybody who earns more than $21,000 and less than $87,000 will get a tax rise if the Treasurer gets his way. That's what the Treasurer thinks: they don't pay enough. He wants more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government have more answers for the Australian people about these challenges. They say they've got a plan. It's a great plan! What they're going to do is give a $65 billion tax cut to big business, and don't worry: it's going to trickle down to you. It's going to trickle down to people on low wages. They say that's their answer to wages growth, and they talk about the United States, because they say it's a good idea because President Trump's done it. That's the government opposite. They say it'll lead to increased wages because it has in America. That's what they say. The Treasurer says it and the Minister for Finance says it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just take a few moments of the House's time to look at that argument. They talk about Walmart—not famous as a best-practice employer—and say they've increased their minimum wage from $9 to $11. The government will tell you it is because of United States tax cuts. I wonder if the government also therefore says the tax cuts are responsible for Walmart laying off 10,000 workers at the same time. That's what is happening in America as we speak. Target had already increased their minimum wage to $11 before the tax cut had come into place, and many analysts say that Walmart would have struggled to get people to come and work for them with Target paying more. Kimberly-Clark, at the same time in the United States, is in the process of sacking 13 per cent of its workforce. Those tax cuts are working great for jobs and growth, aren't they?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the best that this government can come up with: an attempt to see it trickle down through osmosis, hope and prayer that somehow this will create jobs and growth. There is no requirement on businesses to increase wages and no requirement on businesses to invest. There is no obligation on businesses for them to get the tax cut—no, just a straight blank cheque and, 'Please, it would be great if you invested some of this; we don't want you to give it to share buybacks, but you can if you want to.' That's what's happening in the United States: more and more share buybacks as a result of the tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer's great myth, which he was perpetuating a few moments ago at the dispatch box, is that he tells us it's all paid for because it's in the budget. It's a great revelation the Treasurer gave us at question time—that it's in the budget! Of course it's in the budget; it's his budget and his policy. But just because you write something in the budget doesn't mean it's paid for. He argues that the NDIS wasn't funded. It was in the budget. He argues that the Gonski funding package wasn't funded. It was in the budget too. If the Treasurer applies his own logic, his argument collapses on other matters. The fact of the matter is that the corporate tax cut is unfunded and the budget would be $65 billion better off if they didn't proceed. That's the fact of the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, as I said before, we have personal income tax. Personal income tax is, of course, something we hear about a lot. The Treasurer said just late last year that it was their intention to provide income tax relief wherever and whenever possible. Well, they are providing income tax relief—I give them that—wherever and whenever possible for people who earn more than $180,000. That's all they're doing. If you earn $21,000, the government don't believe in personal income tax relief; they believe in a personal income tax rise of $300 a year for a moderate-income earner. Seven million Australians will pay more tax under this government compared to the policies of the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw some modelling, some analysis—and I use that term extremely lightly—that the government was referring to about Labor policies which was conducted not by the PBO but by the PMO, the Prime Minister's office. It was conducted not even by the Treasurer's office but by the Prime Minister's office. This so-called analysis conveniently ignored the fact that the Labor Party believes in lower taxes for people on low and middle incomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that does not believe in lower tax; it believes in different tax. They don't believe in shrinking tax; they believe in changing tax. They make a big point about increasing the tax threshold from $80,000 to $87,000. They say that was their 'great big tax cut'. Well, the fact of the matter is that if you earn $85,000, when you take into account that tax cut and the Medicare levy increase, you are worse off by $200 a year. Those people will say to the government: 'Next time, please don't bother helping. Thanks very much for the tax cut: we're $200 a year worse off because of the two successive budgets! Next time you have a bright idea, please keep it to yourself.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a Treasurer for whom consistency is not a strong point. He has argued for an increase in the GST. He has argued for state income taxes—that was a doozy! He's argued for swingeing income tax cuts at the same time as arguing for an income tax rise if you earn between $21,000 and $87,000. But the one thing he is consistent on is that people in the top tax bracket deserve a tax cut, that big business should get a tax cut, but people on low incomes should get a tax rise. We do not agree and we will oppose the government on all those measures—because we have a different set of values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, the Australian people expect their government to understand their concerns—not to conduct miracles, not to wave a magic wand, but to understand their concerns and try and deal with them. Under this government, the Australian people know that the real value of their pay packet is going backwards. The cost of things like electricity and private health insurance is skyrocketing. We have a housing affordability crisis and plummeting home ownership, particularly for young people. We have household debt at record levels—the highest in the OECD—and we have record unemployment and job insecurity. 'Weighing up all the policy options, what could we do to deal with these things?' the cabinet say as they sit around thinking of new policies. They say, 'We will give big business $65 billion and we hope and pray that they will invest it and increase wages'—when all the evidence and experience from overseas suggests that may very well be a forlorn hope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that our 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth continues—that is the responsibility of this House. But it needs to continue fairly. We need to see that growth shared across our community and shared across the country. We need to see the people in the regions benefiting from that growth. As my friend the member for Rankin pointed out last week, the people of Townsville believe in economic growth, they deserve economic growth, and our plan is to deliver a much bigger dividend for them than any $65 billion corporate tax cut ever will. People in the regions deserve a youth unemployment rate that is not above 20 per cent. The people of Australia's regions deserve to know that their children can get jobs. I'll tell you what, a $65 billion tax cut isn't going to do that, a $65 billion tax cut isn't going to deliver on those hopes and aspirations. What a $65 billion tax cut for big business will do is see shareholders, many of whom are overseas, better off, with no obligation for them to invest in this country, no obligation for them to make a decision to create jobs or increase wages, just a cheque from Malcolm Turnbull.</span>

                  </a>  Jump sides! Jump sides! Only on the weekend we read of the inspiration for the member for McMahon's economic career, Paul Keating. It's, what, half past three? Can you imagine Paul Keating, that battler for the westie out there in Bankstown, sitting in his Eames chair at Potts Point, in his Louis Vuitton robe and Gucci loafers—and, as it's 3.30, with a glass of sherry—listening to that? I know the member for McMahon's heart's not in it. I know his agenda. I know his heart's not in it, because, when it is, he rallies to the cry. You can't hear yourself over the top of his cheering for what he actually believes in. The reason you can't hear it now is that he doesn't believe in what he is saying. To argue that the $65 billion tax cuts are for the big end of town, when half of them go to small and family businesses, is just lunacy in the extreme. It is economic vandalism writ large. </span>

Businesses interact with businesses irrespective of size. We caught up with Qantas's Alan Joyce last Friday. There are 3,000 small and family businesses in their supply chain. That is how it works when you reduce tax, and the member for McMahon believes it in his heart of hearts. He has written it in books, time and time again. The quotes get regurgitated back at him at this dispatch box time and time again. And, in saying it, he was right. He was right. When you stand up—</span>

When you stand up and you say that you don't want to give tax cuts to big businesses but then argue that they won't interact with small businesses, you're just ignoring the reality. It's not trickle-down economics; it's the truth. It's how the economy functions. Those on the other side have written book after book, book after book, about this being the case. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, many small and family businesses are in supply chains. At that Qantas hangar last week, I heard of a Toowoomba family that Qantas have given a go to. They used to get their planes painted offshore. A Toowoomba family has been given the chance of a contract to paint Qantas's planes—a small contract to start, but, if they can deliver consistently and on time, they will get a bigger bite of the cherry. I heard from Qantas that Cape Grim beef from Tasmania is served on their planes, along with wine from around Australia. They are actually the third biggest consumer of Australian wines, after Coles and Woolworths. The majority of those wineries are small, family owned businesses up to medium-sized businesses. There is this lunacy that happens in this place too often of defining the size of a business by turnover. </span>

He works from his kitchen table at home, with a mobile phone as his instrument of trade. He sells, in a good week, three to four prestige cars, and in a bad week he sells a couple. He makes between 55 grand and 155 to 200 grand a year. He turns over $15 million to $20 million a year. He does not have one employee. He works on wafer-thin margins. Turnover to define business size in this country is absurd. If you turn over $10 million and run at two or three per cent—</span>

                  </a>  You can't argue that turnover is a part of this equation, along with arguing that businesses don't interact. I know the member for McMahon is being dragged there kicking and screaming, but then you get loony left policy being dictated by Sally McManus, being repeated within 48 hours by the member for Gorton and then wending its way into official Labor Party policy at the National Press Club.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been these figures of 20 per cent as the increase in company taxes and two per cent as the increase in wages in the last 12 months. Of that 20 per cent, the overwhelming majority—more than two-thirds of it—came in the December quarter of 2016 when commodity prices, especially for iron ore and coal, nearly doubled. In fact, the last two quarters of company tax profits in this country have actually gone backwards. If the system of minimum wage increases proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, which is purportedly supported only lukewarmly—and the member for Rankin and the member for McMahon, in their defence, have back away from these comments—is not decided by the independent umpire but by lunatic 28 per cent increases mandated in the minimum wage, you will have businesses across the board going out of business, and employees will be the losers, along with those business owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are talking about irresponsible economic policy being made up because the Leader of the Opposition has become so weak internally that he has had to embrace the left wing of the Labor unions. That's the reality of it. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was the assistant Treasurer in this country, the minister responsible, espoused time and time again exactly what the member for McMahon has espoused in his career, along with what the former member for Blaxland did and delivered when he was in government in the late eighties to early nineties. This is the problem, and the problem is simple: there is a misunderstanding on that side. Some of them get it, but they've been hamstrung by those above them to fall into line with policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy and the platform that they are talking about is dangerous to the economic wellbeing of this country. If you attack business in this country, irrespective of size, you are by default attacking its employees. Any attempt to pit workers against employers is another frustration. It is the politics of envy. The reality, especially in small and family business land, is that the most valuable asset small and family business owners have at their disposal is their staff. They get it. They operate side by side with them on the front line. They go to their weddings, their christenings, their birthdays and their funerals. The staff on the front line of small and family businesses become a quasi part of the family. That is exactly what we are talking about. That is how business operates in the real world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed policies of those opposite, should they be elected, will go from minimum wage increases to completely tearing up and rewriting the industrial relations laws in this country to give their union mates unfettered access to labour markets across the board. Why? It is because the union model is broken. Unions now represent less than 10 per cent of the workforce in the private sector in this country. Unions are telling the Leader of the Opposition loudly and clearly that they need a new business model. The problem is that the policy platform that this team is describing will not only give them a new business model but, at the same time, unleash industrial wars the like of which we have not seen in this country since the 1970s. The result of that will be that businesses will close, irrespective of size. The real losers will be the workers—the people that those opposite purport to represent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the reality of what goes on. The sad part is that I know the sensible economic minds on that side absolutely agree with what I'm saying, because they've said it time and time again. They've now been hamstrung by positions where they have to fall back and tow the company line. The real economic plan, as I keep saying, lies with lowering tax—both company and personal, irrespective of size—across the board so that this economy can be unleashed and its productive capacity harnessed. Wage increases will follow, and those employees across the country will be far better off.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  I don't know about you or the colleagues, but my favourite part of an otherwise pretty disappointing question time from those opposite was when the Prime Minister came to the dispatch box. He had all of that preening self-regard which explains the last 27 consecutive Newspolls. He had the tea pot; he had the sugar bowl; he had the glasses off, held with the thumb. There was all of the explaining about how he was suddenly the king of consistency. This is the guy that's turned his back on the republic, turned his back on climate change and turned his back on all the things he said on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> that he once believed in lecturing the Australian parliament about consistency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for McMahon rightly pointed out, to give the Prime Minister his due there is one thing that he has always been consistent about. Since he's been in this place and before that, he has had one objective alone, and that is to favour the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia. This has been his agenda for as long as he's been in here. He will always go for the top end of town because he doesn't understand the people in this country who work and struggle for a living to provide for their families. They camouflage their company tax cut and their tax cuts for millionaires with all this flowery language that what they actually want is increases in wages and for blue collar jobs to be created. But we know from those 27 consecutive Newspolls that the Australian people know better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was up in Townsville with the outstanding member for Herbert on Thursday and Friday. The Leader of the Opposition was up there earlier in the week. The member for Blaxland was up there last week. We go a lot to Townsville, in the member for Herbert's electorate. When I was up there with the member for Herbert, speaking with businesses and the local community, I was wondering why the Prime Minister and the Treasurer don't go to Townsville. They are hardly ever up there. We're up there all the time, as you know. I think the reason is that if they tried to go to Townsville and say, 'Guess what? We think that the big business tax cuts will flow through to your wages, people of Townsville,' they would get laughed out of town. That's why they don't go to Townsville. The people of North Queensland can spot a fraud a mile away and they know this argument is fraudulent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a con job about company tax cuts trickling down to people who work and struggle. This government look around and see record low wage growth, record high household debt, no consumption in the economy, rising inequality. They look around and see that, and they say that the main challenge that we need to deal with in this country is that currently multinational corporations from overseas pay too much tax in Australia. That's their conclusion when they see what's going on. They look around and they want us to believe that if they shower largesse on the top end of town it will miraculously trickle down to everybody else. That hasn't worked overseas and it hasn't worked here. We have 20 per cent growth in profits at the moment and two per cent growth in wages. That shows that a tax cut of this nature will not necessarily flow through. After all the lectures about a budget emergency they also want us to believe that all of a sudden there's a spare $65 billion lying around. They've used that budget emergency to justify hacking at the social safety net for people who need a bit of government support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't support this $65 billion ram raid on the budget for three reasons. It's unfair: it preferences the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia. It's unwise, because even the Treasury modelling says the benefits will be negligible and way down the track and we can't direct this money towards investing in the productive side of the economy. And it's unaffordable because it does even more structural damage to the budget, when we already have record debt which is growing faster per month than it was under Labor, which had to deal with the global financial crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome a debate about these choices in the economy. It's all about getting the best value for money and growing the economy the right way. On this side of the House we choose to invest in people and their productivity and their infrastructure. We choose not to smash people's disposable incomes, their living standards and the demand in the economy by jacking up tax on seven million workers or taking away penalty rates. Those opposite make a different choice. They choose a tax cut for big foreign multinational companies. Their approach sows the seeds of division in this country by favouring one small group at the expense of everyone else, when we should be coming together and recognising that the only growth worth a cracker in this country is inclusive growth which doesn't leave people behind. We should be realising that a first-rate First World economy like ours needs growth to be inclusive. It needs work to be rewarded and it needs a decent social safety net as well. </span>

In this House all of us should be praising the efforts of industry, the efforts of government and the efforts of everyone who has contributed to this extraordinary result. What we have seen in the past 12 months is that every single day, on average, more than 1,000 new jobs were created, and three-quarters of them are full-time. This is a phenomenal outcome, and it's something of which this government is justifiably proud, because those opposite had a very poor record on job creation when they were in office. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are creating jobs at a rampant speed. Part of the reason that's occurring is this government's very strong policies in relation to economic growth. Among them, most importantly, is business tax reductions. It's already happening, no thanks to those opposite. What happened last year, you'll recall, is that the government said, 'Let's reduce company tax rates for businesses with a turnover of between $2 million and $50 million.' You know what those opposite said? They said no. They said those businesses were too large. They described them as multinationals and as businesses that were undeserving of any tax support. It's very important that people understand the impact that these tax cuts are already having, because we already have a situation where there are literally millions of businesses in Australia with between $2 million and $25 million of turnover that have had—</span>

                  </a>  We're already seeing the benefits of these tax cuts, because smaller businesses are already paying only 27½ per cent. But those opposite voted against that. They said that for a business with $2.1 million of revenue—which probably has, on average, a profit margin of maybe five per cent, which means it makes $100,000, which is about the same as the average household income across Australia—that should not be allowed. They voted against it, and it's very important that people understand that. They said small and medium-sized businesses shouldn't be provided with tax relief. Presumably, they are therefore going to increase taxes on those millions of businesses that are already benefiting from tax reductions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing that the proof of the pudding is in the eating with the massive job creation that's occurring in this economy today, which is an objective fact. It's important that that tax relief is extended to more businesses, because larger businesses also employ millions of people. Those opposite might not understand that, they might not want to acknowledge that, they might not appreciate that, but it happens to be true. Larger businesses employ millions of people. The argument of those opposite appears to be that tax reductions make no difference to the level of investment. Think about that logically, because that's what they're saying. They're saying that if you reduce the level of corporate tax it does not flow through to increased investment and more jobs. That's what they're saying. The logical conclusion is that those opposite would say, 'The tax rate doesn't matter at all.' They're basically saying that, regardless of the level of tax, corporations will invest the same amount of money. That is plainly absurd. </span>

But those opposite say that every business with $2 million or more of turnover should pay 30 per cent tax. That is a bad strategy for the Australian economy. This government understands how to create economic growth. There was 19 per cent growth last year in exports of rural products because of those blockbuster free trade agreements that this government has got into. There was $75 billion worth of infrastructure investment, putting to shame the appalling record of those opposite with delay and delay and delay in those critical infrastructure projects—like Western Sydney Airport, which will create thousands of jobs and is so important for my home state of New South Wales. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I'm very proud of my community of Cowan. They're a strong community, a resilient community and a community that truly embodies the heart of this great nation. When I go out and speak to the people of Cowan and talk to businesses, individuals, families and working parents, what do you think it is that they say to me? Do you think they say to me that what they want from this government is big tax cuts for foreign multinational businesses and millionaires? Do you think that the people of Cowan tell me that they want to pay more personal income tax in order to fund tax cuts for millionaires? Do the people of Cowan, and indeed the people of Western Australia, say that they want their wages to continue stagnating while watching this out-of-touch government back cuts to weekend penalty rates and give a $65 billion bonus to big business? No, that's not what they're saying. That's not what they want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government keeps crowing on about how great it is at financial management. I say to it: tell that to the people of Western Australia, where the former WA Liberal-National government's financial recklessness has just been exposed in a recent report. That report, the Langoulant report, exposes the worst case of financial risk in the granting of billions of dollars of contracts with no business case. Guess who that report implicates? None other than the current federal Attorney-General, who as WA Treasurer in the Barnett government failed to heed warnings of falling GST share, spent at a rate higher than WA's economic growth and increased spending by 10.8 per cent while revenue grew only by six per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't stop there, because it seems that this federal Treasurer is working from the same playbook when it comes to economic mismanagement. For a start, he can't make up his mind on tax, revenue or spending. He fails to heed the advice of the RBA governor about the danger of funding company tax cuts through higher budget deficits and government debt. He continues to spruik the myth of trickle-down economics, as did the minister in his previous contribution today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trickle-down economics has actually never been tested in its purest form, so there is actually no real evidence to support it as an effective way to stimulate growth and jobs—or 'jobs and growth', as those on the other side would say. Former US Presidents Reagan and Bush were renowned for their belief in trickle-down economics, but what happened there? In both cases the exact opposite occurred. In fact, income inequality worsened, and between 1979 and 2005 after-tax household income rose by just six per cent for the bottom fifth. It sounds okay—the bottom fifth got a six per cent rise in their income—until you see what happened for the top fifth. The top fifth's income increased by 80 per cent. The top one per cent actually saw their income triple. So, instead of trickling down, the prosperity trickled up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the road that this government wants us to go down. We have the Prime Minister going and rubbing shoulders with the President of the United States and coming here and saying that this is an economic model for Australia. Well, I don't think Australians want to be Americans. I can only wonder how this government is just so out of touch with everyday Australians that it continues its sole focus on these tax cuts for big business and millionaires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians aren't stupid. They certainly aren't stupid enough to fall for the snake oil con that somehow, just somehow, they're going to be better off when big business gets tax cuts and when millionaires get a tax break. They're smart enough to know that under this government they've seen the real value of their pay packets go backwards, as the cost of living continues to increase while their incomes stagnate and they face job insecurity and underemployment. Australians are smart enough not to trust this government and this Treasurer to deliver a real policy agenda that prioritises their needs for lower energy costs, affordable health insurance, affordable housing and some relief on housing debts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  It's interesting that those opposite come in here today and try to rubbish our economic plan. The reality is that we have record jobs growth. You can't argue with the facts: 403,100 jobs have been created over the last 12 months. That's a little over 1,100 jobs each and every day over the last 12 months. I know that's an inconvenient truth for those opposite, but the facts remain the same. You don't like hearing about that—1,100 jobs. This government places great importance on everyday average Australians, and everyday average Australians are the beneficiaries of those 1,100-plus jobs every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's contrast that with what those opposite are doing under the Leader of the Opposition. They will be introducing $150 billion of extra taxes. There's no doubt that those opposite subscribe to the Jeremy Corbyn and the Bernie Sanders schools of economics. We stand for mums and dads. We stand for small business. We stand for jobs. Those opposite have absolutely no clue. They lead with their chins. They come in here and they bring butterknives to gunfights. It's quite amazing. Let's look at what those opposite stand for. Those opposite stand for a protection racket for you know who—a protection racket for the CFMEU. I notice that some of those opposite here today were proudly sitting in the Federation Chamber just a couple of days ago with their CFMEU badges on. They're not wearing them now. In his address to CFMEU workers at the Oaky mine, Mr Shorten said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">have the highest respect for the mining and engineering division of the CFMEU. These people will be with you the whole way, always have been and always are, always will be. If we form a government, yeah, we'll do the right thing, we won't let you down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some of us who are a little bit more suspicious of the Leader of the Opposition, I'd say that he's up to no good, he's offering them all sorts of skulduggery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at a recent case about the CFMEU. The CFMEU are the gift that keeps on giving, and yet those opposite still continue to come in here and support them—not only wearing their badges and but also taking their money for Labor Party donations. In a recent matter, just a couple of days ago, Federal Court judge Richard Tracey reiterated previous court findings that the CFMEU showed a repeated disregard for the law, spending millions of dollars of union funds on penalties when the money could have been used to benefit their workers. I've got some interesting figures here. Those opposite might be interested to know this. The ABCC told the court in that same matter that the construction and general division of the CFMEU's Victoria-Tasmania branch received revenue of $30.9 million in 2016. There would be many businesses in Australia that don't receive that sort of money. It had a net surplus of $226,000 and net assets valued at $58 million. Is it any wonder that the CFMEU treats fines imposed by the courts as the cost of doing business—as the cost of running a protection racket for the continued thuggery of its officers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  I just want to remind the good member for Fisher that nowhere in this MPI did it talk about the CFMEU or unions; it actually talked about defending the government's own $65 billion cuts. But not one of the government's speakers has been able to get up there and speak in defence of these cuts and why they are good for this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to being out of touch with the needs and realities of everyday Australians, this Prime Minister could win a Golden Globe award, a Logie—you name it. He could take the cake for it when he swans in here from his digs in Point Piper, his very modest accommodation, with his high-fibre NBN connection that gets him the most reliable speeds of anybody in this country. I've lived in Lindsay my whole life, and we're often subject to unfavourable stereotypes. Well, for the benefit of those opposite, including the member for Fisher, let me run through some of the ways in which the people in my community are more hardworking, more real and more deserving of some of this out-of-touch Prime Minister's investment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of living in Lindsay is three per cent higher than that in the Prime Minister's electorate. Why? It is because we have so few local jobs that local residents can work in. Every household and every family needs two cars—one for each adult. When you travel to work you also get to pay the M4 toll, which is a bonus, because that road was paid for many years ago. We like the freeway. The member for Macquarie likes the freeway. We like the extension. But what we don't like is having to pay for a road that has already been paid for—and we don't want to pay for it for another 43 years! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an abject failure of the Abbott government. When Labor supported the project, when we were in government, we did so with a caveat that we would not hand out any Commonwealth money if the New South Wales Liberals insisted on a toll. In walked Tony Abbott and, voila, just like that, the caveat was ripped up in favour of the toll operator, and we got the toll back. Of course you don't need to own a car to go to work. You could squish yourself onto one of the Western Sydney overpacked trains—very reliable, hardly ever air-conditioned in 47-degree heat; that's fine—but only after you drive to the train station! There's no equity in public transport. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to work, you'll have your penalty rates cut after the government take an axe to the industrial relations system—day after day after day. They hate unions and they hate workers. They'll cut your penalty rates. They expect you to work more hours for the same amount of money or less. They also don't want you to have a secure job, with casualisation taking over every industry that's out there. If you do have a job, you'd better hope your company isn't too reliant on energy, because your job will be even less secure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of electricity has skyrocketed under these Liberals, and households and businesses are paying through the nose, especially in Sydney, where we've seen increases of close to $1,000 in four years. We were hoodwinked by this government. We were told it was all because of the carbon tax. Well, the carbon tax has gone but the prices are still rising every day. There is no energy policy for businesses, which is creating uncertainty, and you certainly don't hire people when you do not know what the future holds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For households, another thing chewing through their declining pay packets is the real cost of health insurance, which seems to favour the shareholders rather than the policyholders. The costs rise, value for money decreases and ordinary mums and dads can't afford to keep paying. We have plummeting home ownership—the lowest levels we have seen in decades—rentals that are priced out of ordinary pay packets and no real plan to tackle any of this. There is no investment and no idea about how the other half lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With so much opportunity to help people, particularly those in Western Sydney who are already facing a high cost of living and reduced opportunity, why is this government focused on cutting Western Sydney University to the tune of $98 million, which is the highest cut to any university, cutting $21 million to every public school in our community and not investing in the most under pressure hospital in New South Wales? Well, it's no surprise, because it's too busy supporting a $65 billion tax cut to those who least need it, expecting it to trickle down the line and result in some kind of support in the take-home pay packets of people in my community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has no policy agenda to prioritise the everyday Australians who need support. At a time when this government has seen the budget deficit grow to $23 billion under its watch—which is quite ironic, given it is forever passing itself off as the best friend to Australia's economic bottom line—its $65 billion tax cut is unaffordable, and we will fight it. We will fight it for people in electorates like Herbert, Macquarie, Lindsay, Chifley and Cowan—for ordinary Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a shame our Prime Minister is so inspired by the Trump administration and wants to follow his lead. What will inspire him next? Will it be a US-style medical system where the rich get cured, an education system where the wealthy and those born to privilege are educated, or even, heaven help us, a US-style industrial relations system where there is no minimum wage? While this merchant banker looks after his mates—multinationals and millionaires like his banker mate Mike Baird—with tax cuts, he's happy to fleece ordinary taxpayers. We on this side of the House will not stand for it. We will fight every day for the people who elected us to be here.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  I'm not going to try to deal with the nonsensical contribution from the member for Lindsay. She talked about us trying to crash the industrial relations system in this country and yet, as the Leader of the Opposition has made clear, that is his absolute intention. What's quite confusing about this MPI, the government prioritising big business over ordinary Australians—I don't think members opposite realise this—is that big business employs half of all ordinary Australians. Big business employs millions of Australians. In deserting big business, in saying to businesses across Australia, whether they be small, medium, family or large, as the Leader of the Opposition has, 'We are going to create a war on business; business is going to get nothing from us,'  Labor is sending a very strong message. It's sending a message to the workers in the steel manufacturing companies, the mines, Bunnings and Qantas that they don't matter. That is the bottom line with this opposition. Half of all Australians work for large Australian companies. Ninety per cent of workers in this country work for private companies. This opposition is so dangerous in its loony left policies that it is willing and advocating to drive up the minimum wage by 30 per cent, which even it knows will destroy thousands of jobs across this country. Frankly, it is an embarrassment. The member for Rankin is sitting there, having written all the member for Lilley's speech notes promising four surpluses that never actually occurred, and sniggering. We have committed, as confirmed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, that we will be in surplus by 2021. We are on track to deliver that. We are actually going to have our company tax cuts paid as part of our budget forecasts. Frankly, the member for Rankin sitting there sniggering really just shows the embarrassment of what his contribution was when the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was in power. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do feel for the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, who has been completely rolled by the left of the Labor Party, by the Jeremy-Bernie-loony-left economics of Labor. The great economic messiah of the Labor Party, who talked about company tax cuts, who talked about the importance of what that would do for jobs and investment and growth and business confidence, that was backed by the Leader of the Opposition, has been rolled by the member for Sydney. The loony left of the Labor Party is coming at him in force and the member for McMahon is slinking around the boardrooms of Australia saying, 'Don't worry, fellas, we will deliver the company tax cuts. Just stay quiet. I know and you know that we need these company tax cuts for Australia, but we just have to run our agenda to get into power, then everything will change.' It is absolute hypocrisy. As the member for Reid has said in this debate, it's quite clear that the shadow Treasurer, here in the House, does not believe a word he has spoken. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need company tax cuts to make us internationally competitive. The Treasury modelling has shown this will add $30 billion in additional revenue and increase our GDP by 1 per cent. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said in the public hearing before the House Economics Committee that I proudly chair, 'The worst thing we can possibly do is rack up more debt and deficit.' That's what the Labor Party's agenda is: more debt and deficit. They went to the last election with $16 billion more deficit to contribute to the economy. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank also said, 'The best way to combat inequality is to deliver jobs.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering jobs in spades: 403,000 more jobs in the last year, the best jobs growth on record. That is 1,100 jobs a day. Already we are seeing in some sectors of the economy a tightening of the labour market, which the Governor of the Reserve Bank has identified quite clearly and objectively. In contrast to the loony left policies of Labor, we are delivering for jobs and for the economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249908" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  Let me be very clear: there is absolutely nothing confusing about this MPI. There is absolutely no doubt that the Turnbull government is a government for the top end of town. You only need to look at the coalition's track record in Townsville to know that this is a government that does not care about regional Queenslanders, as identified by the member for Rankin. This government does not care about families, it does not care about pensioners and it certainly does not care about workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just look at the evidence regarding the Abbott-Turnbull governments' record in Townsville. Townsville's unemployment rate when Labor left federal government in 2013 was lower than both the state and national averages. Now Townsville's unemployment rate is higher than the state average and almost double the national average. Townsville's unemployment rate has almost doubled under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous Labor government, manufacturing in Townsville soared. When Labor left federal government in 2013, more than 8,400 people were employed in the manufacturing industry. But, under the Abbott-Turnbull governments, manufacturing has nosedived and we have seen job losses of more than 3,000. The manufacturing industry made up eight per cent of our local employment, but under the disastrous coalition governments manufacturing jobs and industry have spiralled down to 4.9 per cent. These were good-quality jobs, and now they are gone under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there has been the complete and utter decimation of our construction industry. Just yesterday, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Townsville workforce report</span> commissioned by TP Human Capital showed that Townsville had 442 fewer construction industry business registrations last year than in 2012. That's a drop of 15.7 per cent. That's more jobs gone from Townsville under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then let's look at the retail industry. The retail industry can often be a good yardstick to measure whether an economy is thriving. However, in Townsville, the workforce report clearly indicates that Townsville is not thriving, because we have lost 153 retail business registrations between 2012 and 2017. That's a fall of 17 per cent. That's more jobs gone. Let's not forget the coalition government's job cuts to the public sector: 110 ATO jobs gone, 50 Defence jobs gone and 40 aviation jobs at 38 Squadron gone. The coalition is a government of job cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this government is killing industries and jobs in Townsville, it is giving big business a $65 billion tax cut. That shows the absolute nerve of the Turnbull government—giving big business a $65 billion tax cut and increasing taxes to low-income workers. Under this government, anyone earning between $21,000 and $87,000 a year will pay more income tax. Under the Turnbull government's plans to increase the Medicare levy, millionaires get a tax cut of $16,400 while someone earning $60,000 gets a tax hike of $300. This is a government for the top end of town, and regional Queenslanders have had enough. I will fight tooth and nail in this place every single day against the Turnbull government's job cuts and big business tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to Townsville, and only Labor will deliver jobs for Townsville. Labor has committed $200 million to hydro power on the Burdekin Falls Dam. Labor has committed $100 million to address our long-term water security infrastructure. Just last week, Labor committed $75 million for the port expansion project, a commitment that will deliver more than $580 million in benefits to our regional economy. Labor has a jobs plan for Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is out of touch and, frankly, doesn't appear to give a damn about pensioners, workers or families. It is completely unacceptable for a government to think that it's okay to give a $65 billion tax cut to big business while workers are struggling, penalty rates are being cut, people are flat out putting food on their table and pensioners in my community can't turn their air conditioners on because they simply can't afford the electricity bill. This government is beyond out of touch when it comes to regional Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I've got to say the very tone and tenor of this motion is patronising. It's patronising from the very get-go, saying that the government is prioritising big business over 'ordinary Australians'. It's patronising because those opposite clearly don't have the most basic understanding of economics—that people pay taxes. So when you say, 'Reduce tax rates on businesses that are held and owned by people,' what you're actually saying is that people who have shares in publicly listed companies are not ordinary. I think that's a pretty spectacular proposition to put forward. When it comes down to it, we have hundreds of thousands of Australians who are self-funded superannuants, who stand on their own two feet and don't draw from the taxpayer for their basic livelihood. They are apparently, according to the modern Labor Party, not ordinary. I note everybody on the other side has basically left the chamber now. They are saying to pensioners who support their incomes with savings or shares that they also are not ordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But perhaps the greatest hypocrisy in this motion comes from its mover, the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen. He got up and moved this motion, so I thought, 'I wonder if he owns any shares and whether he, according to this motion, is not ordinary.' It's funny. If you go through his history, he was one of the people elected in 2004. You may recall that any member of parliament elected after 2004 no longer gets the defined benefit scheme for their superannuation. They have to hold an account with an industry fund, a retail fund or a self-managed superannuation fund to take care of their security. And, yes, Mr Bowen does have a superannuation fund. He does. So, if you and go check the register of interests, by his own standard he apparently is not ordinary, just like every other Australian he has slurred as part of this motion. In the end, it comes back to a basic principle of economics, which is that only people can pay taxes. There can be legal structures where people facilitate and organise economic activity, but only people pay taxes. By moving this motion, the shadow Treasurer has said that millions, if not all, Australians are not ordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's look at the simplistic lack of understanding from the shadow Treasurer and others in comparison to what this government is actually trying to do. It's actually trying to create jobs and opportunities to build this nation's future. It is actively working to try to make sure the investment necessary to build the economy is there in an increasingly globally competitive environment. It's actually delivering. It's actually creating the economic environment for the private sector to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. In fact, at the moment, we're talking about 1,100 jobs per day throughout the entire year of 2017. We had an annualised growth rate of 2.8 per cent, something that delivered enormous benefit to actual ordinary Australians. I say that without any sense of criticism, because ordinary Australians are the people who build this country. Ordinary Australians are the people who work, who save and who build their own future. Ordinary Australians are people, through their savings, who invest in this country, buy shares and find opportunities to create wealth for their families and their own security. Ordinary Australians are the people who actually benefit from the measures that are being implemented by this government. Ordinary Australians are the people who the Turnbull government is explicitly focusing on to make sure that people have those opportunities that those on the other side would rather deny. Instead, they're focusing not on ordinary Australians. What they're focusing on—and they always have and they always will—is the interests of the people who pay the salaries to stack their membership in the trade union movement. Ordinary Australians stand up against them and defy their interests.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  These bills give effect to the government's announcement in their 2017-18 budget of the establishment of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. The corporation would operate an affordable housing bond aggregator and administer the National Housing Infrastructure Facility. The bond aggregator is intended to bring together the lending requirements of multiple community housing providers and finance those requirements by issuing bonds to institutional investors. Let me make it clear that the Labor Party supports the bond aggregator. In fact, this announcement came after Labor's housing affordability announcement in April last year, in which we announced that we would establish the bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing. So we are very glad that this idea has been taken up by the government. We welcome it and support it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We announced that the bond aggregator would help community housing providers access cheaper finance for new affordable rental housing. The housing bond aggregator would directly source cumulative funds from wholesale markets on behalf of community housing providers by issuing bonds to private investors. Funds raised by bonds issued could then be loaned to providers. The National Housing Infrastructure Facility is intended to provide financial assistance of up to $1 billion in the form of concessional loans, grants and other financial instruments. The facility comprises $600 million for concessional loans, $225 million in equity investment and $175 million in grants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill sets out the corporation's functions, which are, primarily: to make loans, investments and grants to improve, directly or indirectly, housing outcomes; to determine terms and conditions for these loans, investments and grants; and to provide to registered community housing providers business advisory services and other assistance in capacity building. The bills state that the Treasurer may give the board of the corporation directions about the performance of the NHFIC's functions, which constitute the investment mandate. The investment mandate may include directions about the strategies and policies to be followed for the corporation to function effectively; decision-making criteria for making loans, investments and grants; granting financial assistance to the states and territories; providing services and assistance to community housing providers; and risks and returns relating to the corporation's investments. The bill also establishes the corporation's board, whose members must have appropriate qualifications, skills and experience in one or more of the following fields: banking and finance; law; housing, including social or affordable housing; infrastructure planning and financing; local government; or public policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the infrastructure facility was first announced last year, we did raise concerns that this was a $1 billion slush fund for the coalition. Treasury officials at Senate estimates said nothing had been set in stone and there would be flexibility in how the allocation of these funds would take place. Now we have received some degree of comfort from the investment mandate direction exposure draft, which suggests this is less likely to be the case. Concerns do remain over the extent to which the facility will actually contribute to increasing the housing stock, particularly affordable housing, as opposed to facilitating greenfield development of new private-market owner-occupied housing or new private-market investment or rental housing. We will suggest in the other place that there be a short Senate inquiry, which will in part go to this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that we don't have any major issues with these bills, we won't be opposing them in this place. To be very clear, though, any housing affordability package or strategy which the government claims to have is simply a grab bag of ill-thought-out measures. Just last week the International Monetary Fund released the latest Article IV consultation with Australia. The Treasurer liked some of it, but he was not quick to point out a press release which said that the IMF had endorsed the Labor Party's policy, in effect, of changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The IMF surmises that the Commonwealth's housing tax settings favour leveraged housing investments in upswings that might encourage excess demand for housing—a point that we have been making for years. The Treasurer also failed millions of young Australians when it comes to adequately dealing with housing affordability. He has seen an Australian economy and housing market which is locking out young people from the housing market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IMF report expressly states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the investment side, the combination of high capital gains discount rates and unlimited negative gearing can encourage leveraged real estate investment in market upswings. While similar tax incentives are also present in other countries, they tend to be more limited …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This adds to the long list of bodies which have supported negative gearing or capital gains tax reforms. The IMF goes on to say that the capital gains tax discount on housing should be reduced and other tax incentives limited. It is a very clear position from the IMF. The other tax incentives are, of course, negative gearing, and our policy is, of course, to limit it to new housing only.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IMF also adds that the government budget position is predicated on a rapid rebound of nominal growth at the time when the government's unfunded company tax cut will deliver a structural hit to revenue over the medium term. I also make the point, as I said before, that the IMF is one of a long list of organisations, experts and individuals who've called for negative gearing reform. This list includes, but is not limited to, the OECD, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, the Grattan Institute, the Reserve Bank, former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens and, indeed, former Treasurer Joe Hockey, who stood opposite during his farewell speech, before Labor had announced its policy, and called for exactly this policy to be introduced. The only people who don't seem to get it are the cabinet, who just simply refuse to deal with negative gearing, despite reports that the Prime Minister and Treasurer went to cabinet with a proposal to reform negative gearing—and they got rolled in the cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any housing affordability package which doesn't include negative gearing reform is a damp squib, and it gives false hope for young people. We have the most generous property tax concessions in the world, and they should be reformed. You should not get more support from the taxpayer to buy your fifth, sixth or seventh home than you do to buy your first. It is warped. It provides warped incentives in the market. It distorts the market and provides an encouragement to overleverage. We have one of the highest household debt rates in the world—certainly in the OECD. If we wonder why that's the case, it's in part because we have the most generous property tax concessions in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We provide more support to property investors through the tax system than any other country does, and that encourages leverage. It encourages people to buy more houses and to borrow more money for investment purposes, and that leads to the risk of financial instability. It leads to concerns that, should there be a change in the market, should there be a downturn, should there be an increase in unemployment, should there be increases in interest rates of some substantial proportion, that would lead to instability, which is in part due to the very high household debt in Australia. So there are multiple reasons to reform negative gearing and there are multiple reasons to reform the capital gains tax discount. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in budget repair which actually has a positive social outcome. The government believes in budget repair which does not deliver a positive social outcome—quite the contrary. They believe in cutting the age pension by changing indexation. They believe in scaling back support for families on low and middle incomes. They believe in all those things. But, where you have a proposal which would put first home buyers on a more level playing field, which would help with financial stability but which would provide a very strong return to the budget, particularly over the medium term, over the decade, the government reject it. They say: 'That's not good enough. It might improve the budget, it might improve housing affordability, it might actually deal with some elements of financial instability, but we don't like it.' That is because they are not prepared to take political risks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who lack ticker when it comes to reform. They will not do negative gearing reform, and they should. Instead, they search around for measures like this, which are not objectionable in and of themselves, like most of the measures the government embraces, but which simply don't add up to much. They are not a reform package. They are not changes which will see people on low and middle incomes find it easier, young people in particular, to get into the housing market. They are simply not. What they are is a grab bag of measures cobbled together as an attempt to look like the government's doing something. Remember our old friend the assistant minister who said in the lead-up to the budget that the housing package reform would be amazing in its scope, breathtaking in its reform, unbelievable in its achievement? Expectations management was never his strong point. But this was the point he was making—he was suggesting that we would have a massive reform program. Of course, none of that happened. Instead we had the grab bag of measures, the minor matters involved in the budget, which amount to not very much at all. The Treasurer is casting around—</span>

                    </a>  As my friend the member for Chifley reminds the House—and I'm in his debt for doing so—the government instead attempted a scare campaign on negative gearing, and said it would crash the housing market. The Minister for Home Affairs said it would crash the stock market. And all the time they were sitting on that Treasury advice which said, 'Actually, Treasurer, that's not true. That's not the case.' Treasury made it very clear in their briefing to the Treasurer that they weren't entirely opposed to Labor's package. They could see the strong points in Labor's package. They didn't see that it was going to crash the stock market. </span>

                    </a>  They didn't see a sledgehammer. The Treasurer is very quick to trot out Treasury advice when it suits him. He's very quick to trot out advice which is actually from his own office when it suits him, but where he's got Treasury advice which contradicts him, he sits on it. Not only does he not release it; the government resists ferociously the FOI requirement and sits on it. It took two years to get that out of FOI. I give credit to the ABC for getting an FOI from the Treasury, eventually, released in January. The Treasurer still hasn't dealt with it, still hasn't provided commentary on it, still hasn't answered the questions about why he misled the Australian people, contrary to the advice he had. He knew what he was doing. He knew what he was saying was not true. Instead, he engaged in the scare campaign. </span>

They do not care about housing affordability. They believe in a scare campaign. Their believe that their priority is to scare people about the impact of Labor's policies. We believe our priority is to put first home buyers on a more level playing field. On that basis, we do not oppose this legislation in the House, but we call on the government to do so much more.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I will come back to where I was before I was rudely interrupted. The Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018, as I said, has been given full Labor cooperation. As you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security was the beneficiary of great advice from Mr Michael L'Estrange, who conducted an extensive review of the intelligence community and services. I want to commend Mr L'Estrange for his work because he also very effectively drilled down beyond the superficial levels of issues that may have been presented by only senior levels of services and came to appreciate very well the issues that also occupied some subterranean levels of the intelligence community and services and the issues that were playing on and perhaps hampering the best delivery of those services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the effect of the reforms has been wonderful for the morale of ASD and its staff. I also want to emphasise, however, that out of that there is no change to the role of ASD in supporting the Defence Force. ASD will report directly to the defence minister. An MOU has been entered into between the CDF and the head of ASD. While I'm on that subject, I'd like to commend Paul Taloni for his service within ASD. Some suggested he would've been a great head for ASD, but that wasn't to be. Paul has been a fantastic servant to this nation in the security area. I've had many wonderful dealings with Paul and really appreciate the service that he has rendered, particularly the service he rendered in his time at ASD.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we broke this debate I was also talking about the workforce issues. I know this is an issue that my colleague the member for Chifley is very keen to also pursue. I was talking before the break about the fact that the Australian Defence Force has now gone into the approach of establishing an Information Warfare Division and a cyberwarfare capability within Defence that is more creative and imaginative than simply trying to shoehorn uniform members or shoehorn civilians into the regime within which members are recruited and trained within the Defence Force. They may not need any of that training or need that elaborate framework that supports our uniform personnel to work in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned we were very pleased with the appointment of Major General Thompson, who is eminently qualified to head up this group and some of the areas that are under his wing. He also works in that role to the Commander of Joint Capabilities Group, so it has been given the appropriate emphasis within Defence. He, as I mentioned, has a PhD in cybersecurity and a special forces background. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That division is starting with about 100 personnel. That was the goal to kick it off, but it is planned that it will grow to about 900 by the end of the decade. In order to support a workforce of 900 you probably need a supply pool of around 3,000 personnel, as we usually work through these things and as a rule of thumb for support for capabilities, taking into account leave, reassignment, turnover and mobilisation issues. That level of workforce to sustain just this unit is extremely significant. It poses a real issue for our country about how we supply and support all of our security agencies. I was talking about what the AFP had brought to us. I think you were there with me, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, the day they talked about those petabytes of data they had to wade through. We met with the PhD student from Data61 who was on loan to hem, helping them design and build the algorithms to penetrate that deep well of data that's so important in the mission they have for tracking terrorists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This poses issues to us more deeply as to how we manage that workforce issue and how we share these demands with industry. There are examples of how that's been done. My colleague the member for Chifley is aware of what is done in Singapore in relation to their service people that are based on their national service requirements. We don't have that available to us. Israel also has a very creative way of approaching this, taking the best and brightest from their high school graduates in the STEM areas and taking them into a program called Talpiot, where they enhance their skills and education over a long period of time, a number of years, without putting them in uniform. When they've finished and completed that refinement, they are then deployed into these security areas right across the security establishments with the specific mission of finding ways to improve what they do, to refine, innovate and develop the capabilities. That has led them to be able to use some really creative and innovative methods of dealing with, for example, terrorist financing. A really instructive work that's come out recently, called Operation Harpoon, describes the journey they've been on in tackling the matrix of counter-terrorism financing that needs to be put in place across the spectrum and across the globe and how you bring down those networks of financing. That Talpiot system is working extremely well for them. Those graduates then go out when they've finished their security time to help build their innovation economy and the innovation state, as we know. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have national service available to us to draw on those Singaporean or Israeli models. We need to look at a creative way of managing and sharing that workforce. The workforce of the future in the Defence Force may not even be largely made up of the classic warriors we've had in the past. There'll always be a need for boots on the ground in many circumstances, but in the complex technological battlefield of the future a lot of our systems will be automated. You'll be seeing a lot of warriors sitting with bottles of coke and pizzas in shipping containers, steering automated systems. They don't need to be people who can do run, jump, dodge courses and these sorts of requirements. </span>

                    </a>  Kids who are good at Xbox and those sorts of videos games are actually well prepared for the new digital environment that we will see in the future. The JSF and our new future submarines may well be the last crewed platforms of their type. We're already seeing Israel experimenting with automated land vehicles as well, resupply vehicles in the Gaza conflict. There'll be more and more of this automation, more and more emphasis on these technological skills, and certainly in the battles of cybersecurity that we will see in the future, which overlays so much into the industrial space. We've been hearing a lot about industrial espionage and foreign interference on the intelligence committee. There is such a need and demand for us to tackle that more effectively. In this industrial space, the back door approaches that a lot of the cyberassailants use really require industries, subcontractors and other industries that are involved in supplying our security capabilities to be reinforced and secured as well. So I think the government has taken a very good approach in establishing these regional cybersecurity hubs where business can engage in that respect. That needs to be built upon and expanded. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the workforce, what I believe we need to look at—this is just a personal view—is some form of civil defence corps in the future whereby we don't necessarily take full-time people for whom we can't compete with industry on a race to the top with wages but who can do national service duty, reserve duty, with our security organisations for whatever periods of time and then go back to their home business or company. We know that workers who work in the field at the moment are attracted to the motivation of serving their country and that the areas of work that they do in this space are unique. You will not find this experience in private industry. Some workers are obviously attracted to being able to do that work, which they won't find anywhere else. So I think we could set up some mechanism or regime by which we share these skills, these talents, with private industry. The private companies involved in supporting this could be given appropriate consideration, kudos, for doing that—gold star companies who provide us with those kinds of workers. I do think we need to come up with some creative solutions for that in the future. It will need a rethink of how we structure these workforces in Defence, the Reserves and private industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think in the future, for ASD, we've got challenges in terms of the other organisations that we're going to have to monitor. We've been dealing with the issues of how we tackle this challenge of foreign interference, civil society and politicians and how all that conflates. The complexity of the legislation that's currently before the committee points to the challenge of how that is addressed in legal terms, in legislation. We've seen some serious challenges in the drafting, in making that coherent and effective. In that space, we're going to need good consultation and take on board the advice, particularly of those whose job it is to oversight our security agencies. We've heard some very important evidence from people like Margaret Stone and Bret Walker. At the end of the day, we will not be winning this fight against those who seek to do us harm by surrendering all of the unique features that make up our democracy and the unique features that create the level of freedom and civil society that we enjoy in this country. It's about getting that balance right. We're looking forward in the committee to working through that process with the Attorney-General's Department, our colleagues on the committee and our security agencies to get that balance right. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I acknowledge at the outset your deep interest in these matters, as well as that of the member for Eden-Monaro. He and I have spoken on this issue. I was very pleased to be able to have the opportunity to follow him in this debate on the bill that's before us now, the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018. It has come about as a result of previous thought that has been contained within reviews in this area, specifically the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review. A specific recommendation within that review, recommendation 6, called upon the very things that this bill is trying to establish today—that is, the Australian Signals Directorate be set up independently as a statutory agency within Defence. The review examined the history of ASD, looked at likely direction but reflected specifically on its current value within Defence and the types of things that needed to happen, specifically that greater independence needed to be granted to the ASD. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note two paragraphs from that review that are worth reflecting on in this debate, chiefly, that ASD has evolved from a primarily defence signals collection agency after World War II to become Australia's national signals intelligence authority, conducting intelligence, military, cybersecurity and effects operations through the application of advanced technologies. It also added this paragraph: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… ASD is now a genuinely national asset—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">absolutely true—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">playing a much broader role than that defined by its previously exclusive Defence focus. This is highlighted in its current additional responsibilities as a—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">emphasis on this—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">national source of information assurance and cyber security. There are also strong and growing interdependencies between ASD and other intelligence agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I highlight these points is that, while ASD is absolutely providing critical support within our defence and intelligence communities, it must be recognised that ASD is also providing broader support within government circles against the growing cybersecurity threats confronting both government and business. On an almost minute-by-minute basis there will be either an agent or an actor, somewhere on the world stage, always testing the defence mechanisms of government and business through cybersecurity attacks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a growing problem. In fact, when I do talk with businesses, particularly those engaged in the digital economy, whenever I just make reference to cyberskills there is an almost instantaneous reaction. Businesses are very much engaged in this issue. They are thinking a lot about it and deeply concerned about the impact of cybersecurity on their operations. There are two things. One is obviously the tech knowhow and having the equipment that can help you deal with those threats. But, ultimately, the tech is only as good as your people, your processes, adherence to those processes and ensuring that your organisation will be able to defend itself against some of these acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying that, I want to recognise that ASD has been heavily relied upon within the public sector to help guide public sector agencies, departments and the like on how to withstand the cybersecurity attacks and threats that we're seeing on a much more regular basis. It has done an exceptional job in that way. But the reality is that the ASD has become a victim of its own popularity. With so many people depending on ASD, it is putting a lot of pressure on their operations. It's also potentially accelerating the need for this next phase of its evolution, as has been prompted by this legislation, and, thankfully, has been given added impetus by the intelligence review that I referenced earlier. But not only is ASD under pressure to change because of the increasing demand and call on its services; on this whole issue of cybersecurity, while a lot of major businesses are thinking a lot about it, there's probably a greater need in particular for small and medium enterprises to start thinking more and more about what can be done in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other element that was touched upon by my colleague the member for Eden-Monaro a few moments ago is the whole issue of workforce development. I've spoken strongly about the fact that the biggest thing affecting the digital economy is skills shortages. It's been estimated, by people in the know, that we probably need in the order of 100,000 new people—skills—to help in our broader economy and, in particular, in terms of our digital capabilities. When you look at cybersecurity, there is an absolutely acute need for greater cybersecurity skills. From ASD to the public sector and to the private sector, this will affect our ability to withstand some of those increasingly sophisticated attacks that we're seeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Cyber Security Growth Network CEO Craig Davies said that the demand for skills in this sector has outstripped anyone's ability to produce skilled candidates. He said: 'It's such a rocket ship this industry; we have zero unemployment and the demand is massive.' As has been observed, he's been given the responsibility to work out how to respond to that shortage. He says: 'Education and growing the skill set is an important part of our program of work.' There have been recent government estimates that we need at least another 11,000 cybersecurity specialists over the next decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I humbly commend Craig Davies on his observation that TAFE will play a very important role in vocational education. I imagine and believe in the broader digital skills capability development in this nation that vocational education will play a bigger role in being able to move a lot more quickly and be a lot more agile in meeting skills, and we do need to ensure that it's provided support in this area. If we are relying upon it to help train up cyberexperts in this nation then it will require an investment by governments in relation to that. I think that is something we need to look at in the longer term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other nations, as the previous speaker noted, have taken a lot more novel approaches, if I may characterise it in that way, to the way they respond to cyberskills shortages. In November I was in Singapore visiting, in particular, Singaporean cybersecurity experts who'd reflected upon other initiatives that have been embarked upon by the Singaporean government—for example, modifying their national service program to ensure that, as is the case over there, where young people are required to embark upon national service they can nominate to basically conduct themselves or participate in a cybersecurity training pathway. Off the top of my head—and I'm happy to be corrected if I'm wrong—they're expecting in the short term 200 young people to participate in that and, over the longer term, 2,000 young people. They are building skills in that way. Then they will not just deploy them within the defence establishment of Singapore but also look to ensure within the private sector that young people go on and recognise that there is a pathway for them to be able to apply their skills in a cybersecurity sense. They obviously—and, again, the previous speaker reflected on this—have a pathway that's not necessarily open to us but are thinking very carefully about the fact that Singapore is being used as a route where agents will try to channel some of their attacks. They witnessed this in the course of the last 12 months and they are deeply concerned about it. I was very grateful for the briefings that I received from them. As has been recognised by this government and by many of us in the opposition, they are a partner we should work with on these matters. Particularly in terms of skills development and developing longer term strategies in relation to preparing for these threats, they're a very valuable partner. I suspect that our friends in Malaysia and Indonesia, too, think very deeply about these issues.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention this because of the fact that we will probably need to think laterally about how we meet that skills shortage. Some have suggested, for example, including cybersecurity options in the national curriculum. Certainly that is an idea worth pursuing, but I do note that every time there's an issue that's confronting us in either the economy or the community the first port of call as a solution is the national curriculum. There may be some things we need to pursue. I do note, as I said earlier, that vocational education may offer us a pathway, but some of the things put on the table earlier about working within our own reserve system and some of the things that are being considered there to encourage young people to use that as an avenue to develop their cyberskills are absolutely worthy of further consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is not simply a business threat or a business risk that needs to be managed. What is happening is that our businesses, large and small, are being used as a mechanism or entry point to cause problems on a much broader scale from a cybersecurity perspective. We need a much broader approach to cybersecurity, not just depending on the ASD, although they will play a critical part, but recognising we all have a responsibility in this space. We should be ensuring that either from the business sector or from government we are addressing this very serious issue in terms of: (1) capability with respect to having the skills available to help us out; and (2) putting in place the processes and mechanisms to take this very seriously and not pushing it off to a specialist or someone we believe is in the know and can always sort this out. As I said earlier in my remarks, you can have the best tech in the world but, if your people don't follow the processes, you will find yourself in a world of grief. We've found that in some of the cybersecurity and data breach episodes that have been experienced. It has been something as simple as leaving a password on a Post-it note that has allowed someone to get access to someone's account and open up a whole raft of data that should not have been exposed more broadly. It does need to be taken very seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the ASD has been empowered under this legislation to become an independent statutory authority. It's being heavily relied upon by both government and business to provide guidance on cybersecurity. I've asked within the opposition about resourcing of the ASD longer term, and, given the increased pressures and expectations that are being placed on them, how we'll do that, but I'm conscious that you can't continually ask for resourcing of the ASD in an environment where we are facing these skill shortages. So this is something that needs to be addressed more broadly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, from the opposition's perspective, we welcome what has been put forward. I think it is important that we on both sides of the House use this as an opportunity to emphasise the need for us to take this issue of cybersecurity seriously, to prepare for attacks and, certainly, if we do put those mechanisms in place, to adhere to the mechanisms because it is in our longer term interests that we do so. I thank you for the opportunity to be able to contribute to this debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate and the support for this bill across the chamber.  The Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018 implements the recommendations of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review to establish the Australian Signals Directorate as an independent statutory agency within the Defence portfolio, reporting directly to the Minister for Defence, as endorsed by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend ASD's functions to allow the Australian Cyber Security Centre, or the ACSC, to cooperate with industry and to operate within ASD, in accordance with recommendation 3(b) of the review. In broad terms, the bill will separate ASD from the Department of Defence and establish it as an independent statutory agency within the Defence portfolio, under the control of the director-general of the ASD from 1 July 2018. The agency will from this date report directly to the Minister for Defence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the ASD as an independent statutory agency outside of the Department of Defence will provide the agency with greater independence in how it recruits and retains its specialist workforce. The report by the review was very clear in its views on ensuring ASD is best structured into the future to meet its responsibilities and the requirements of government. In this context, the report of the review noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… ASD will be better placed if it remains in the Defence portfolio but if it is in a position to operate with greater independence from the Department's requirements, especially those in relation to its capacity to recruit, retain, train, develop and remunerate its specialist staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For ASD, the option of continuing to operate within the Department of Defence's employment framework, even with some specific exemptions, is not the most effective way forward. It would increase the risk of losing additional critical talent, skills and capabilities. ASD needs to be more in control of its own destiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the employment of staff, ASD would operate outside of the Public Service Act framework. This will provide ASD with greater flexibility to recognise the skills of its specialist workforce. This structure will reflect the need to retain those individuals with highly sought after skills, such as those with science, technology, engineering and maths qualifications. ASD will be required under the bill to adopt the principles of the Public Service Act in relation to employees of the ASD to the extent that the director-general of ASD considers they are consistent with the effective performance of the functions of ASD.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to changes to how ASD will engage and remunerate its specialist staff, the bill implements the recommendations of the review by amending ASD's functions to include providing material, advice and other assistance to any person or body listed in the act—rather than Commonwealth and state authorities only—on matters relating to the security and integrity of information that is processed, stored or communicated by electronic or similar means, which will allow the ACSC to liaise with industry. The bill also amends ASD's functions to include preventing and disrupting cybercrime. This section will provide ASD with a function to prevent and disrupt by electronic or similar means the use of information and communication technologies to commit or facilitate serious crime by people or organisations outside Australia. Serious crimes, such as child exploitation, will be captured by this new function. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for the establishment of ASD on a statutory basis and the appointment of the Director-General of ASD to control ASD and its staff. It provides that the Director-General of ASD must brief the Leader of the Opposition about matters relating to ASD. It gives the Director-General of ASD powers to employ persons or employees of ASD outside the framework of the Public Service Act 1999. And it amends other legislation as appropriate to replace references to 'director of ASD' with 'Director-General of ASD' and to remove references to the Department of Defence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes an additional function for ASD to protect the specialised technologies and capabilities acquired in the performance of its other functions. ASD cannot perform its important functions without being able to protect its tools to ensure that ongoing utility and protect Australia's national interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also has a number of transitional provisions to ensure that good governance of ASD continues during the implementation of the new arrangements. The establishment of ASD as a statutory authority puts the ASD on a similar footing to ASIS and ASIO as a national security and intelligence asset. Given ASD's increased national responsibilities in relation to cybersecurity, and also the critical operational support it provides the Australian Defence Force, ASD will now have the appropriate statutory functions to ensure it is well placed to support ADF operations and its national responsibility for combating cybercrime, including the provision of advice to the private sector into the future. Also, to correct the record, the bill will not be making consequential amendments to the Crimes Act that were outlined in the second reading speech relating to assumed identities, as those matters will be addressed in a later bill. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Crimes Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme—Worker Screening) Bill facilitates access to criminal history data held by the Commonwealth for the purposes of conducting an NDIS worker screening check clearance. It's a bill that Labor welcomes and supports. The change proposed in this bill enacts part of the Council of Australian Governments' decision of December 2016 to implement a new quality and safeguards framework for the NDIS, which includes a commitment to work with the states and territories to deliver nationally consistent worker screening for the NDIS. Labor of course supported the establishment of the new quality and safeguards framework in the parliament last year. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of the NDIS worker screening policy is to protect people with disability from harm and abuse. This bill will permit criminal history information to be disclosed and taken into account in assessing whether a person who works or seeks to work with a person with disability poses a risk to such a person. The Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 states that people who have been convicted of a crime and subsequently pardoned, had their conviction quashed or their conviction spent, are not required to disclose their criminal history. Currently a small number of exceptions to this rule exist—for example, for those applying for a working-with-children check or applying for employment with a law enforcement agency or an intelligence or security agency. This bill amends the Crimes Act to extend this exception to people who work or seek to work with people with disability to require them to disclose criminal history. It's a sensible reform that will go some way to improving the safety of some of the most vulnerable members of our community: people with disability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the National Disability Insurance Scheme continues to roll out across Australia in the coming years, the number of disability service providers will increase. Indeed the latest quarterly report on the NDIS shows that the number of approved service providers increased by 17 per cent between September 2017 and December 2017. The report showed that in New South Wales alone, where the rollout of the scheme is most advanced, there are now more than 6,000 registered service providers. As we continue to see this growth in the scheme, we need to make sure that the people taking the new jobs that are part of the NDIS are properly screened. It's anticipated that the NDIS worker screening check will become available in New South Wales and South Australia from July 2018, in Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory from July 2019 and in Western Australia from July 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS worker screening policy is being developed in consultation with the states and territories, taking into account the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. It's envisaged that worker screening units will be established in each state and territory in order to undertake employment screening in relation to work with a person with disability. The term 'work' is defined broadly to include those working directly with people with disability in a paid or voluntary capacity as well as leadership roles of institutions or, for example, people holding roles on boards or committees. The information may only be disclosed for the purposes of undertaking the NDIS worker screening check. The bill also requires that the minister undertake two reviews of the changes to be completed no later than 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2022 respectively and to report on the effectiveness of the scheme to parliament. The responsibility for the overall design and broad policy of NDIS worker screening will be held by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which will commence operation on 1 July this year. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the broader questions about the abuse of people with disability. Last week in the media we saw details of the tragic death of Sarah Hammoud. Sarah was 22. She died in hospital in March 2016 from septicaemia about two months after a visit to her care home had raised alarm bells. Sarah had lived in care since the age of 13. She could not communicate, having been born with severe intellectual disability caused by having three X chromosomes instead of two. According to evidence given to a coronial inquest, Sarah was 'half dragged and half carried from a taxi in a shocking incident witnessed by community workers'. The evidence was that 'when Sarah got to where she lived, her elbows were very discoloured and one was very swollen'. Just months later, Sarah was dead.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sarah's tragic case, sadly, is not unique. These shocking and harrowing cases of violence and abuse are far too often experienced by people with disability, and they just cannot be ignored. We know that people with disability experience much higher rates of violence than the rest of the community, and in many cases this violence occurs in places where they're meant to be receiving support. We know that children with disability are at least three times more likely than other children to experience abuse. We know that 90 per cent of women with an intellectual disability have been sexually abused. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament cannot let this abuse be swept under the carpet. A royal commission is needed so that people with disability, their families and carers can tell their stories to the highest level of judicial inquiry and seek justice. Only a royal commission has the weight, authority and investigative powers to examine these horrific accounts of violence and abuse against people with disability. We have seen how effective the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has been over the last five years, how important it's been, particularly for survivors who, for many years, weren't believed and how important its recommendations are. So now we need a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disability so that we can bring about systemic change to make sure that this horrific abuse doesn't happen again. That's why, in May last year, we announced that a Shorten Labor government would establish a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disability. The disability sector continues to call on the Turnbull government to establish a royal commission into violence and abuse of people with disability. I must say, I think we would all be pleased on this side of the House if the Turnbull government would begin the work to establish a royal commission as soon as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start, Labor supports this bill because we support action to protect people with disability from abuse, violence and neglect, and facilitating access to criminal history data held by the Commonwealth for the purposes of conducting an NDIS worker screening check is an important safeguard in protecting people with disability. A nationally consistent worker screening check will make it more difficult for people with poor records in one jurisdiction to move to another, continuing to place people with disability at risk of harm. This is appropriate, because we do know that people with disability are at greater risk of abuse than others in our community. That said, it is nevertheless very, very important—and I call on the government again—to establish a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disability. It is the right thing to do, and a royal commission should be established as soon as possible. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  I note that this legislation, the Crimes Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme—Worker Screening) Bill 2018 has been a long time coming. People with a disability are some of the most vulnerable in our communities. They have been, and sadly will continue to be, exploited. We must not negate our duty of care to those who are vulnerable in our communities. Let's be very clear. Labor has supported and will continue to support a quality and safeguards commission for the NDIS. We must absolutely ensure we do everything that is possible to protect all our citizens, especially those who are marginalised by disability. The worker screening clearance is well overdue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this government is bungling the rollout of the NDIS every single day. You only need to go into any of our local federal MPs' offices and ask to see their list of constituents who have had issues. My office is fielding about three complaints a day. I accept, though, that a massive social reform like this won't happen overnight and there will be many, many creases that need to be ironed out. But how can you legitimately claim to care when the government neglected this advice that was given to them in 2016, only to implement it and make it mandatory from 2018?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Screening workers for suitability against their criminal history when working with vulnerable groups should be a standard practice in a civilised society—that's if we are to learn anything at all from the royal commission that Labor fought so hard to establish. We fought hard to establish it under the Gillard government because we knew there were people who were preyed on. We listened to their stories and we actually acted. If we are to learn anything from that royal commission and not repeat the mistakes into the future, criminal checks for those people who are working with vulnerable groups is a commonsense approach to ensuring that we do something to prevent this from occurring ever again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why Labor has supported industry, stakeholders and carers who have called for a royal commission into abuse against people with a disability. Frankly, I wish it wasn't something that we had to do. Clearly, though, it will be until this government gets serious about protecting all Australians, not just protecting its own shady behaviour. Sadly, though, transparency and owning up to injustice are not things this government is really keen on or good at, even though their minister said: 'Recent inquiries and reports make it clear that far too many people with a disability have experienced abuse.' If the Prime Minister's minister can admit to that then where is the care, where is the compassion and where is the justice for these people? Simply put, those things don't exist under this government. Someone who had a hand in bringing the NDIS to life, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, knows what it takes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame on the Prime Minister for being too busy launching royal commissions and personal vendettas against Bill Shorten—who actually did come in here and stand up for people. The government are too busy launching a royal commission into allowing unions to stick up for workers' wages and conditions and they are too busy sending the AFP in to raid union offices and collect a piece of paper that was already on the public record. It is an outrage that they deny people with a disability the option to have a royal commission into injustices that have already occurred. The government are too distracted about their own inadequate performance and would rather deal in this low-rent, tit-for-tat schoolyard garbage than tackle some of the things that are wrong in our community and are hurting vulnerable people right now. It would be incredibly painful for families who receive services through the NDIS to know that these criminal history checks are not in place, that worker screening has not been mandated in the rollout and that there would be people who have been exposed to risk because of this abject failure. It is a basic duty of care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have gone further in our support for people with disability than this say everything, do nothing Prime Minister ever will. If he was serious about protecting the rights of people with a disability, he would take action to prevent injustices and correct injustices done in the past. Let's do the numbers. And, no, Prime Minister, these aren't the numbers on whose support you have—which, concerningly, are the only numbers he is concerned about. I will give you a few numbers to get obsessed about. I hope these ones keep you up late at night just as much as the other numbers do. Ninety-two per cent of women with an intellectual disability have been sexually assaulted in their lives. Sixty per cent of those assaults occurred before the girl's 18th birthday. Children who have a disability are three times more likely to experience abuse than children their same age without a disability.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Has no-one in this government ventured into the real world lately? You only need to talk to the parents of children who have a disability to understand the anxieties and the fears they have about the abuse of their special-needs kids—to the point where some parents have such little faith in the system that they deny their children services because they cannot be assured that their special-needs child will not be preyed upon and they don't let them out of their sight. This has a terrible impact on that parent and carer's health and their wellbeing. It also has an impact on that child who misses out on services out of fear.</span>

They're still vulnerable people. This wilful ignorance perpetuates the pain and suffering of already vulnerable people. You need no further proof that this Prime Minister ignores all the evidence than his rejection of the Victorian parliamentary inquiry into abuse in disability services, which recommended that the state lobby for a royal commission into this matter. You also need look no further than his ignoring of the Senate Community Affairs Committee recommendation that a royal commission be established following on from its inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with a disability in institutional care. The government did not provide a response on this matter until 16 months after it had been tabled, and they rejected it, even though the minister admitted that there were reports of instances abuse. Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would really like the Prime Minister to roll out of his bed, come in here and use his position of power and privilege to stick up for these people. </span>

We are happy to work with them on this in the interests of protecting vulnerable people. This legislation deals with workers in the future, and it has taken almost two years to implement. It is so inadequate, yet this Prime Minister thinks it'll do. What about the people who have been wronged in the past? Why do they get ignored? Where is their justice? When you know better, you do better. This is one step towards doing better in the future. It won't be enough, it will never, ever be enough, but it is something. </span>

I want to thank all those people who are working in disability services, supporting vulnerable people, and who are doing the right thing, because I'm sure there are more of them that do than don't. There are more people doing the right thing, and we need to ensure that, if they witness something, if they have concerns, if they hear something, they are protected in saying something. Bad things happen when good people do nothing. We must ensure that good people are protected in workplaces and that their representation by unions—who have always looked after workers' rights, including people who speak up and act as whistleblowers—is maintained. Instead of the government's dog-whistling, let's listen to those from the trade union movement and those with the gumption to stand up and speak out against injustice wherever it occurs. Unlike those opposite, we don't throw those people under a bus. We need to encourage confidence in the people with a disability and the workers in that sector who protect them to speak out. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  When people with complex and serious disabilities come to see me at my mobile office or at my Windsor office, it's often easy to see the warm relationship that exists between them and their carer. I'm also regularly reminded of the trust that's put in the carer's hands. Whether the person is in a wheelchair, whether they have an ongoing mental health condition or whether they have an intellectual disability, it is clear that the character of the carer is vital. But it's also, sadly, not unusual or unheard of to have a family whose experience has been difficult and challenging in finding carers whom they can trust to deliver the level of care that they or their loved one deserves. But the tools to be able to ensure that an individual is the sort of person who should be given the responsibility of caring for a person with a disability simply haven't been there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill, the Crimes Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme—Worker Screening) Bill 2018, which makes it possible for criminal history data held by the Commonwealth to be accessed for the purposes of conducting an NDIS worker screening check and clearance. The Crimes Act prevents disclosure of spent, pardoned or quashed convictions, except in limited circumstances. While exceptions already exist, they haven't applied to the disability sector. I always thought it was strange that there was an exemption in the Crimes Act for checks on people who were working with children or applying for a job, even as a consultant, or with a law enforcement agency or an intelligence agency. When you were working for someone with a disability, it didn't qualify. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">History has shown us—in fact, I think the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> revealed some of the dreadful details late last year—that people with a disability experience higher rates of violence against them than the rest of the community, often at the hands of the people who are supposed to be caring for them. So I was pleased to see it was agreed at a COAG meeting in December 2016 to deliver a nationally consistent worker screening program. This bill certainly extends the exception to the rule so information held by the Commonwealth about a person's criminal history can be taken into account when deciding whether it's appropriate for someone to work closely with a person who has a disability. A nationally consistent worker screening check is going to make it more difficult for people with poor records in one state or territory to move to another and to continue to put people with a disability at risk of harm. It's appropriate that the state and territory based worker screening units get that full history. We are certainly satisfied with the safeguards in this bill to protect rights to privacy by ensuring the information can only be disclosed for the purposes of undertaking the NDIS worker screening check and will be overseen by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner from 1 July this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome these changes because we are serious about the safety and wellbeing of Australians who have a disability. They and their families deserve peace of mind about the people caring for them. But, of course, these changes only apply to people covered by the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The protections for people with disabilities in a whole range of other environments outside the NDIS remain a problem. For example, the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> program showed there had been more than 200 allegations of abuse against children with a disability in New South Wales schools alone in the previous two years. I know, and I hope, that these instances are the exception rather than the rule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My mum was a teacher in a school for profoundly disabled students in Sydney's western suburbs for many, many years. I saw firsthand the wonderful care and the quality environment that those children had. It was a place full of music and laughter. Sadly, the ABC report tells us that that isn't the experience for every student with a disability. That's one of the reasons I'm disappointed that this legislation doesn't establish a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with a disability. According to Disabled People's Organisation Australia, 92 per cent of women with an intellectual disability have been sexually assaulted at some time in their life. Sixty per cent of those assaults have occurred before they turn 18. Children with a disability are at least three times more likely to experience abuse than other children. Those statistics are chilling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The individual stories are harrowing. I have had distressed medical professionals walk me through the process that they've been forced to take to try and get police to take action to investigate allegations of sexual assault of people with disabilities, and I've spoken to those same police to try and get action taken. The Prime Minister says investigating assaults is a state issue. But it is clear to me that the reasons and circumstances of assaults and violence against people with disabilities go beyond state boundaries. I'm not alone in believing that this is an important issue. Only last year, 163 community groups and 380 individuals got together calling for a commission to investigate these types of assaults and neglect. We're talking about people like St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, Amnesty and the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples—organisations that really understand what is happening in our communities and are privy to some of the dreadful stories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Carolyn Frohmader, from Disabled People's Organisation Australia, said that, as an advocate for more than 20 years, she had heard repeated, horrific stories across all settings. She described it as an issue of critical, urgent national significance. She said assaults were at epidemic proportions and a royal commission was needed to unify a mishmash of regulatory bodies in the states and territories. It is awful that she thinks things are getting worse, not better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Prime Minister was really serious about protecting the rights of all Australians with disability, he would not only take the action this bill does to prevent these sorts of things but take action to prevent harm being done in the future and he would correct the injustices of the past. Only a royal commission can do that. That is why, last year, we announced that a Shorten Labor government would establish a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, in 2006, a Victorian parliamentary inquiry into abuse in disability services recommended that the state lobby for this sort of royal commission. In 2005—we're going back three years—the Senate Community Affairs References Committee recommended that a royal commission be established following their inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability in institutional care. The government didn't respond to that recommendation until 16 months after the report was released. What was their response? It was to reject a royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish I could share the view the Prime Minister has that the quality and safeguarding framework will be enough to protect people with disability, but all the evidence tells us that it won't be and that we need to have out in the open what the dangers are and what the experiences are so that we can come up with ways to prevent them in the future. It is actually cruel not to take action and to ignore the crimes committed against people with disability in the past. It is unforgivable not to be finding ways to prevent these things occurring in the future. The voices of people who have been abused must be heard. If the Prime Minister were serious about protecting people with a disability, he would join with Labor and commit to a royal commission.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme is one of the largest social and economic policy reforms in Australia's history. At full scheme, it is estimated that the NDIS will be supporting around 460,000 Australians with a disability. The NDIS is a transformational social policy which is being delivered by this government. This will require a new, nationally consistent approach to quality and safeguards. In December 2016 the Council of Australian Governments endorsed the NDIS quality and safeguarding framework, setting out a new approach to regulation for NDIS to protect NDIS participants. The framework was developed in consultation with a range of key stakeholders, including people with disability, their families, carers, providers and peak bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationally consistent NDIS worker screening is an important element of this framework that will minimise the risk of harm to people with disability from the people who work closely with them. It will reduce the potential for providers to employ workers who pose a high risk of harm to people with a disability and deter individuals who pose an unacceptable risk of harm from seeking work in the sector. Worker clearances will be portable across jurisdictions and employers, reducing duplication and complexity for workers and providers living or operating in multiple states and territories. Workers who hold an NDIS worker screening check clearance will be subject to ongoing monitoring at a national level for relevant criminal history or commission records.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A national NDIS worker screening check is a major step forward from the variable arrangements operating in each state and territory. This bill, the Crimes Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme—Worker Screening) Bill 2018, is an important step towards nationally consistent NDIS worker screening, which will help to protect people with disability from experiencing harm. This bill creates exceptions to the provisions that prevent disclosure of spent, quashed or pardoned convictions for persons who work or seek to work with people with disability in the NDIS. Reports of abuse and neglect perpetrated against people with disability may not be pursued for a variety of reasons. The difficulties experienced in securing a conviction where the victim is a person with disability and the challenges faced by people with disability who are victims of crime are now well documented. For these reasons, Commonwealth, state and territory governments have agreed that it is appropriate to consider a person's full criminal history, including spent, quashed and pardoned conviction information, to assess the risk they may pose in working with a person with a disability in the NDIS. This bill will allow relevant Commonwealth criminal history records information about workers to be shared with state and territory worker screening units so they can make a more accurate and informed assessment of the risk that a person may pose to people with disability in the NDIS. This bill has been informed by arrangements already in place for working-with-children checks and the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures the right balance is struck between safeguarding the rights of people with disability and the rights of individual workers to privacy and employment. The exchange of information permitted by this bill is subject to the same stringent safeguards in place for working-with-children checks. Information will only be disclosed to prescribed worker-screening units for the purposes of worker screening. The bill requires the Attorney-General to be satisfied that certain criteria are met before a person or body can be prescribed. A person or body will not be able to be prescribed unless the Attorney-General is satisfied that the screening unit has the legislative basis for doing so and complies with applicable privacy, human rights and record management legislation. The person or body must also comply with principles of natural justice and must have risk assessment frameworks and appropriately skilled staff to assess risks to the safety of a person with a disability. The bill also contains staged reviews of its operation. The department will also conduct a privacy impact assessment of the measures proposed in the bill. These are important safeguards against the misuse of criminal history information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The paramount consideration must be the right of people with disability to live lives free from abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation. The provisions in the bill are a reasonable and necessary measure to ensure people with disability have access to quality and safe supports and services under the NDIS. The NDIS worker-screening check will not replace the responsibility of employers to recruit suitable employees and provide a safe environment for people with disability, but it does represent a very significant reform designed to strengthen the national standards to address abuse and neglect for the most vulnerable in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to consult the stakeholders to establish nationally consistent expectations for the conduct of providers, the training and screening of their workers and the quality of supports and services that they deliver under the NDIS. I extend the government's thanks for the commitment and contributions made by so many people across the community as we work together to implement quality and safeguard arrangements, including this bill, that support the right of people with disability to access safe services and supports in pursuit of their goals and the effective implementation of NDIS. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  We have before the House today another set of bills that talk about reducing pressure on housing affordability but don't tackle the real issue. It's another example of the government's inadequate response to tackling housing affordability in Australia. With the homeownership rate as low as it's been in 60 years, Australians need more than the half-baked measures contained in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 2) Bill 2018. Labor won't be opposing the bill in the House, but we need to be clear that these measures, along with everything else the government has announced on housing affordability, are simply insufficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Monetary Fund last week released its latest article IV consultation with Australia. It is a useful exercise, and the Treasurer was very quick to jump on the release. He put out a media alert saying 'IMF endorses Australia's economic performance'. There was one notable exception from the Treasurer's media announcement, and it's not surprising to have an omission, given that the government had been caught out misleading the House on the impact of Labor's policies on negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. What was that omission? The IMF endorsed changes to negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. The IMF surmises that the Commonwealth's housing tax settings favour leveraged housing investments in upswings that might encourage excess demand for housing. It's a point that federal Labor has been making for years. Reforming negative gearing and the capital gains tax is good for housing affordability, but it's also good for the budget and good for financial stability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer hasn't only failed millions of young Australians when it comes to dealing with housing affordability; he's also presiding over an economy and a housing market that is more vulnerable to future economic shocks. We have household-debt-to-income ratios at record highs. The system is suffering a degree of instability that is unnecessary as well as unfair. The IMF report explicitly states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the investment side, the combination of high capital gains tax discount rates and unlimited negative gearing can encourage leveraged real estate investment in market upswings. While similar tax incentives are also present in other countries, they tend to be more limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IMF goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The capital gains discounts on housing should be reduced and other tax incentives limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not Labor saying that; it's the IMF. The IMF also notes the government's budget position is 'predicated on a rapid rebound of nominal growth'. This is at a time when the government's unfunded company tax cut will deliver a structural hit to revenue over the medium term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Treasurer out there talking about tax relief for low- and middle-income households, but in fact his company tax cut is paid for by raising income taxes on low- and middle-income Australians. Under the coalition, seven million Australians with earnings between $21,000 and $87,000 will see their income tax rates go up. Under Labor that will not happen. The Parliamentary Budget Office has analysed the extent to which the return to surplus is built on the backs of middle-income Australians paying more income tax. It found that it's the middle quintile that is paying the lion's share in order to get the budget back into surplus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, we're also dealing with an issue of financial stability. The Treasurer recently declared 'mission accomplished' on housing affordability, after arguing that, after the introduction of APRA's macroprudential measures, there's no need to scale back the most generous set of tax concessions for property investors in the world. But macroprudential measures have their limits. The Customer Owned Banking Association noted that, for banks with a relatively small share of the investment market, placing caps on their loan book stymies competition and has led to some of those smaller providers pulling out of the market. The consequence of these macroprudential measures is less competition in the market to provide investment loans. Indeed, it is a point which is even made by some of the smaller of the big banks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IMF specifically goes to the interaction of APRA's macroprudential measures with housing tax reform. It concludes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Housing-related policies have begun to address housing-related imbalances and should be complemented by tax reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But these bills don't provide the sort of tax reform that Labor has been advocating. Instead they give effect to three of the government's measures from last year's budget. Here we are, just a handful of sitting weeks away from the 2018 budget, and the coalition is still bringing into the House measures from the 2017 budget. The measures in the bills remove the entitlement to the capital gains tax main residence exemption for foreign residents, enable a reconciliation payment for near-new dwelling certificates and provide a capital gains tax incentive for investment in affordable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the CGT main residence exemption, these bills—in conjunction with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Foreign Resident Capital Gains Withholding Payments) Act 2017, which passed the parliament with Labor's support—remove the entitlement to the capital gains tax main residence exemption for foreign residents. There has been a concern that this would affect certain New Zealand constituencies. A clarification to specifically state that Australian tax residents can access this exemption appears to mean these constituencies are not impacted, but there will be a short Senate inquiry specifically to confirm this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the reconciliation payment, the Near-New Dwelling Exemption Certificate was introduced in June 2017 to allow developers the flexibility to sell near-new dwellings—that is, dwellings previously subject to a failed settlement to foreign persons. Consistent with the process for payment under the new dwelling certificate, the bills introduce a reconciliation payment for the New-Near Dwelling Exemption Certificate, by which developers pay additional fees for each near-new dwelling that was sold to a foreign person by the developer under the exemption certificate. This ensures equivalent treatment to that given under the New Dwelling Exemption Certificate, which allows property developers to sell new dwellings, to foreign persons, paying a reconciliation fee for each dwelling under the exemption certificate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the CGT incentive, from 1 January 2018 an additional 10 percentage points capital gains tax discount will be provided—increasing the discount from 50 to 60 per cent—if a CGT event occurs to an ownership interest in residential premises used to provide affordable housing. The additional capital gains tax discount applies to investments by individuals directly in affordable housing or investments in affordable housing by individuals through trusts, other than public unit trusts and superannuation funds, including managed investment trusts, to the extent the distribution or attribution is to the individual and incurs a capital gain. The dwellings must have been used to provide affordable housing for a period or periods totalling at least three years. Similarly, a trust or managed investment trust must have used the dwellings to provide affordable housing for a period or periods totalling at least three years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would note the interaction of this last measure with build-to-rent developments. We are more than used to this government lecturing us repeatedly on the notion that housing affordable is all about supply. It's why they tell us they care about rental affordability and why they won't deal with negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. But this does make it all the more perplexing that the Treasurer chose, without any consultation, to kill off an emerging sector of Australia that could have played a role in increasing the supply of rental accommodation. Build to rent isn't yet a big thing in Australia, but it has potential—according to CBRE, up to $300 billion of residential assets. Or, at least, that was the potential before the Treasurer decided to kill it off. Build to rent, as honourable members would be aware, is simply corporate investment in large-scale rental accommodation. It is quite a big thing in Britain and the United States. In the United Kingdom, as of the middle of last year, 17,000 build-to-rent units were completed with another 24,000 with under construction and nearly 55,000 granted planning permission. In the United States, the build-to-rent market is valued at US$163 billion a year. Many residents in cities such as New York will be renters in buildings which are owned by a single owner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Build to rent doesn't simply add to supply. Large scale rental accommodation provides economies of scale in terms of building maintenance and it provides benefits in terms of lower construction costs leading to potentially lower rents. It also solves a potential market failure. When the builder is the owner, then the incentive for the builder to cut corners in ways that might increase subsequent maintenance costs is reduced. Just as an owner-builder is pretty careful about the quality of their build, because they know they're going to have to live in the place, build-to-rent developers will be especially careful about the quality of their apartment buildings knowing that they will own the entire apartment building and rent it out. Leaky balconies are less likely to be prevalent in a build-to-rent environment. An experience in Britain has pointed to some high-quality offerings with well-developed communal facilities, attractive to segments of the rental market which aren't searching for standalone houses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are relatively light tenants' rights in Australia, and I refer anyone interested in this to the Grattan Institute's terrific report that looks at the rights that tenants have in various countries compared to Australia. The ability of an Australian tenant to have a dog on the premises or to hammer a nail into the wall is far less than it is in many other advanced countries. Given this, it's worth noting that corporate or superannuation fund landlords would be highly unlikely to evict tenants to move into the property themselves or because the landlord has decided to sell. Build to rent therefore gives good tenants peace of mind. It gives enhanced security of tenure and it creates an opportunity for those long-term leases that are so absent from the Australian market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another factor makes build to rent attractive in the Australian context, and that is our large pool of superannuation savings. That means that institutional investors could find a build-to-rent investment highly attractive. Experts, participants in the housing industry, have told Labor about the potential for the development of a build-to-rent sector. It's not a silver bullet, but it is potentially part of the answer, and the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, and the shadow housing minister, Senator Cameron, have engaged actively with the sector and have heard back from the sector about the benefits of build-to-rent developments. There are issues to be dealt with, the interaction of the GST system with build to rent being one, but genuine consultation could well deal with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that was before 14 September last year, when the Treasurer announced he was banning managed investment trusts from investing in housing, apart from narrowly defined 'affordable housing'. The announcement took immediate effect. There wasn't any warning. There wasn't a skerrick of consultation. When the government handed down what they told us was a comprehensive housing affordability plan, in the 2017 budget, the crackdown wasn't mentioned. If there were a compelling and urgent case for the announcement the Treasurer made on 14 September last year, why wouldn't it have been part of the government's housing affordability package? The Treasurer said that this announcement was part of the fairness of the tax system. Goodness knows Australians prick up their ears when they hear that the Treasurer actually has an interest in fairness. This is, after all, the Treasurer that says that we don't need to care about inequality because it's falling in Australia—contrary to the words of every expert. But, of all the elements of the managed trust regime which could be the subject of legitimate scrutiny and debate, he chooses to close down the one area that was showing the potential to contribute to alleviating Australia's housing affordability crisis.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer wants to initiate a debate on or a review of concessions that managed investment trusts receive. Labor will work with him on that. But what we'll oppose is clunky policy on the run that harms housing affordability. It is not just federal Labor that has concerns here. New South Wales Liberal Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has been pushing for this, and the federal Treasurer simply says no.

But Labor won't oppose the passage of this bill through the House. It will go to a short Senate inquiry to ensure that our concerns, particularly the effect of the GST main residence exemption, are addressed.</span>

                    </a>  Well, there you go. That says it all, doesn't it? They're willing to take money from big tobacco, but they're not even willing to allow me to put on the record the electoral returns that show very clearly the amount of money that the coalition received from big tobacco. The Prime Minister needs to explain why he thinks it's acceptable for his coalition partners to fill their coffers with donations from an industry that profits from a product that, if used according to directions, will kill more than half its users. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these donations continue, Senator McKenzie's position as Minister for Rural Health is completely untenable. Smoking is the single highest preventable cause of ill health and death in Australia, accounting for more than 15,000 deaths each year. The likelihood of being a daily smoker is up to twice as high in rural and remote Australia as it is in metropolitan areas. And yet the National Party continues to accept money from big tobacco, despite the additional harm that smoking-related deaths do in rural and regional Australia. We see by contrast Labor's longstanding policy not to accept donations from tobacco companies—a position that is reflected in our national platform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced and we fought for world-leading plain-packaging legislation, which, combined with other policies, has seen the adolescent smoking rate drop to a record low. I was here in this place watching how the coalition behaved as that plain-packaging legislation made its way through. You could see early on that they wanted to vote against it. They were doing their level best to square up to vote down plain packaging. In the end they finally did the right thing, but they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to a point of supporting plain-packaging laws, which are now being looked at by countries around the world, who are asking themselves the question, 'How do we reduce smoking rates in our country too?' This is a government that lacks credibility on tackling big tobacco.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures today are uncontroversial. The amendments made in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018 create a new tobacco offence regime, providing a comprehensive set of offences that apply to illicit tobacco that has been domestically manufactured or produced or for which the origin of production or manufacturing is unknown or uncertain. They create new offences for possession of equipment for producing or manufacturing illicit tobacco. They set penalties at a level that will deter illegal activity. They confirm that illicit tobacco for which the origin of production or manufacturing is unknown or uncertain can be seized and forfeited. They define 'tobacco' to align the meaning for excise and excise-equivalent customs duty purposes so the amount of duty on dutiable products is determined in a consistent manner. These measures are simply integrity measures that put beyond any doubt that it is possible to crack down on illicit tobacco, whether domestically manufactured, manufactured overseas or for which the origins are unclear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is Labor that has been leading on this issue. In the 2016-17 budget the Abbott-Turnbull government accepted Labor's policies to increase excise and excise-equivalent duties on tobacco. We see those measures continue to improve the health of Australians and continue to improve the health of the budget. If the coalition are to show that they are utterly serious on this, they need to stop the donations from big tobacco. They need to be willing to put their hand out and say: 'We're not taking your money anymore. We are serious about cracking down on smoking-related deaths.' The day that the coalition cease to accept money from big tobacco is the day they can come in here with their heads held a little higher and the day on which they can say that they are finally taking a serious stand against a product which, if used as intended, kills more than half of its users. This bill will receive Labor's support, but we urge the coalition to do the right thing and stop accepting tobacco donations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I second the member for Fenner's second reading amendment and support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. I reaffirm my support and Labor's support for improving health outcomes for all Australians. The proposed amendments provide a comprehensive set of offences relating to domestic manufacture or production of illicit tobacco and the possession of equipment for the purpose of producing or manufacturing illicit tobacco. They set higher penalties to deter illegal activity and allow enforcement agencies to seize and forfeit illicit tobacco with no known origin of production or manufacture. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always strive towards eliminating smoking related illness and death. We have a proud record in government. We increased the rate of tax on tobacco by 25 per cent and we introduced the world's first and far-reaching plain packaging on cigarettes. The latter has been lauded by health agencies around the world. That is in contrast to those opposite, who continue to take donations from the tobacco lobbyists and industry. While the Prime Minister seems distracted by his National Party colleagues' dysfunction and disillusionment, he remains silent on the tens of thousands of dollars in donations the National Party receives from big tobacco annually. I represent a regional and rural electorate in South-East Queensland. I was discouraged as a local member to learn that the rate of smoking in regional and rural areas, particularly in remote parts of Blair, is almost double the rate of the urban part of my electorate in Ipswich. The National Party, particularly in my home state of Queensland, claim to represent people in regional and rural areas, but they fail regional Australia by taking donations from an industry which profits from a higher rate of tobacco related illness and death in regional and remote areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Smoking accounts for more than 15,000 premature deaths of Australians annually. These deaths are preventable. Labor in office have made significant advancements towards reducing that number. We continue to reject donations from the tobacco lobby, a position reflected in our policy and platform. Labor stood up to big tobacco in 2011 and introduced the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act, making Australia the first country in the world to mandate plain packaging for tobacco products. It wasn't always popular locally in my electorate or around the country, but many countries have since followed our example, including France, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Norway, Ireland and Hungary. The impact of the changes Labor introduced is being noticed and will continue to be evident, I think, for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a wealth of evidence available which shows that plain packaging discourages the take-up of smoking, particularly amongst young people. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's National Drug Strategy Household Survey of 2016, released mid last year, found that the proportion of Australians who have never smoked continues to rise from 60 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2016. I count that as one of the most important decisions I have personally made in my life. As a father, I'm thankful that my daughter's generation is less likely to suffer from the devastating effects of tobacco related illness and disease. I'm proud that a Labor government I was part of played a tremendous role in that outcome. The Turnbull government need to ensure they are taking every available measure to reduce the rate of smoking amongst older people. The survey referred to found that, since 2001, the rate of smoking amongst 18- to 24-year-olds has reduced by half. However, for 60- to 69-year-olds, the reduction in the number of smokers was less than 10 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest opponents of our plain packaging legislation were the tobacco lobbyists and companies. We were criticised by Philip Morris International. We were criticised by British American Tobacco. We were criticised by Imperial Tobacco. But we were applauded and lauded by the World Health Organization and the Cancer Council of Australia and similarly by governments around the world who followed us and set about implementing similar laws. Meanwhile, those opposite continue to take donations from those people who profit from tobacco related illness and disease, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I think this is another example of Liberal Party and National Party members saying one thing back home and another here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, I'm delighted the government's adopted Labor's policy to increase excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco in the 2016-17 budget. Last year, Labor supported the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Duty Harmonisation) Bill 2017 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Duty Harmonisation) Bill 2017. These amendments ensured that roll-your-own tobacco attracts the same rate of excise per kilogram of tobacco as cigarettes. Labor has consistently acknowledged a strong stance on the importation of tobacco related products discourages consumption at home and reduces people's exposure to tobacco products. This significantly improves the overall health of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our attention now needs to be turned to decreasing the rate of production and manufacture of illicit tobacco for domestic sale. The British American Tobacco company, in its submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Law Enforcement inquiry into illicit tobacco stated: 'The excise lost due to illicit tobacco is estimated at $1.49 billion annually.' They imply that, based on the current rate of illicit tobacco consumption of 2.4 million kilograms, an increase in excise could increase revenue from tobacco products to over $3 billion per annum by 2020. This amounts to almost one full per cent of total government revenue. Of course, the best health survey result is always for people to quit for good. The now Department of Home Affairs in evidence to the inquiry into illicit tobacco stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The strike team has … built stronger ties with key international law enforcement partners involved in combating tobacco smuggling at various points along the supply chain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Border Force has been working to strengthen offences to allow officers to address offenders within the full spectrum of the illicit tobacco trade. I have spoken to ABF people on the front line and across a whole range of areas and been constantly impressed by their competence, diligence and commitment to duty. I welcome the moves for the ABF to be more investigative and more disrupting of illicit tobacco trade, providing a greater deterrence. While they're at the front line doing the work, that clearly provides a deterrence for those people involved in criminal activities in the space. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue really isn't about loss of revenue or public health; it's more than that. The Australian Border Force has strong evidence providing links between the illicit tobacco trade and serious organised criminal groups. The illicit tobacco trade undermines the Australian government's strategies in terms of prevention and control of tobacco products. At Monday's Senate estimates hearings into the now Department of Home Affairs, the Acting Commissioner of Australian Border Force, Michael Outram, revealed that the tobacco strike team had seized in excess of 104 tonnes of smuggled tobacco and 233 million smuggled cigarettes since it was established. It is the equivalent of $232 million in revenue and immeasurable savings, can I put it that way, to the public health of Australians. This is clearly a vital measure in cracking down on the scourge of illicit tobacco in Australia. I thank them for the work they're doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite claim they're committed to cracking down on illicit tobacco but evidence at the Senate estimates revealed otherwise. The Acting Commissioner of the ABF revealed the tobacco strike team is 'a lapsing measure that lapses at the end of this financial year'. Rather than continuing what the Acting Commissioner described as an incredibly successful program, the Turnbull government has not funded the tobacco strike team beyond July 2018. I would urge them to have a rethink in this space and to fund the tobacco strike team of the ABF, which have clearly been successful in the work they do. I urge the government to have a rethink in this space. They need to act. They need to start acting in the Australian people's best interests. If they want to see immeasurable improvements in public health, illicit tobacco must be stopped at our borders. They must fund this strike team. In the same budget which handed tax cuts to big business and multinational companies, the Turnbull government has failed to commit to fund a program which is aimed at stamping out illicit tobacco imports and preventing tobacco-related illness and disease. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health of all Australians depends on a common-sense policy when it comes to the sale and excise of tobacco products. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2016 found that 25 per cent of smokers would be motivated to give up smoking if the cost of tobacco products were to rise—the law of supply and demand. If the price rises, people have a disincentive to take up smoking. Fifty-two per cent of smokers who attempted to quit or change their smoking behaviour identified the cost of tobacco products as the predominant motivating factor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leading the world in introducing plain packaging for cigarettes was only the beginning of Labor's achievements in targeting tobacco related illness and disease. In government, Labor previously introduced other key measures. I'm going to go on the record because I think it's very important to note. We increased the excise rate applying to tobacco products by 25 per cent as early as the 2010-11 budget. We introduced legislation restricting internet advertising on tobacco products, consistent with advertising restrictions in other media—another important reform. We put $61 million towards the national tobacco campaign 'Every cigarette brings cancer closer'—a successful campaign. We provided $27.8 million, over four years, for social marketing campaigns targeted at high-risk and hard-to-reach groups. We provided $14.5 million, over the three years from 2008, and a further $10.7 million from 2010, towards the Indigenous Tobacco Control Initiative, which funded 18 pilot projects in Indigenous communities around Australia. Tragically, the rate of tobacco consumption remains frustratingly high, but it is certainly on a downward trajectory with respect to Indigenous groups across the country. We put $100.6 million towards the COAG National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes 'Tackling Indigenous Smoking' measures. There was 'Break the chain', the first ever Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander specific national anti-smoking television campaign, $5 million in one-off funding for Quitline in 2009-10, and $102.4 million to support nicotine replacement therapies and other quit smoking supports through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have consistently shown our commitment to policies which reduce the incidence of tobacco related illness and disease in this country. I'm pleased to see that our excise increases when we were in government have been adopted by the Abbott and Turnbull governments when they came to power. However, this is also a government that has sadly and tragically discarded the 'Every cigarette is doing you damage' campaign, which has existed in this country since 1997 and has received global praise for its effectiveness. That's a very bad decision by this government. In the first three years of the Turnbull government, the AIHW survey found that smoking levels had dropped only marginally compared with the significant differences recorded in the preceding two decades—under both sides of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are simply not doing enough to reduce the devastating impact of tobacco related illnesses and disease in Australia, particularly among lower socio-economic and regional Australians. We remain committed to ensure the current government is held accountable for any underhanded and underdone treatment of tobacco companies. We're supporting the passage of this bill through the House. We believe it will deliver a high standard of health outcomes to Australians. But it's not enough. Much more needs to be done. This government must give greater emphasis to preventive health. Reducing tobacco consumption in this country for older and younger Australians and for regional and rural Australians in my electorate and elsewhere is an important goal.</span>

                    <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. I start my contribution to this debate by admitting that I am a fanatical nonsmoker—with the greatest respect to some of the other members currently in the chamber. My nose is extraordinarily sensitive to cigarettes. If someone lights up a cigarette 100 yards away from me, my nose can actually sense it. It causes me discomfort and irritation. So I would be very glad to see the smoking rate in this country driven down to zero and for all those involved in the tobacco industry to put their productive and entrepreneurial works and skills into other efforts. However, the policies that have been adopted by this parliament, and they were bipartisan policies, were to go down the track of trying to reduce the rate of smoking—something that, as I said, I'm all in favour of—by effectively introducing a prohibition by price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember standing in this chamber a couple of years ago when we had a similar debate on this, and there were members of the Labor Party who refused to acknowledge that, if we were going to increase the retail price of cigarettes by increasing the excise on them, this would lead to a surge in black market activity. There were members of the Labor Party that simply refused to accept that fact. What have we seen since? We've seen that this actually has done exactly that. There must be an acknowledgement by this parliament that, if we are going to go down the track of introducing what is effectively a prohibition by price, that will result in a lot more black market activity. It will create a profit motive for those involved in smuggling activities, attracting them to cigarettes, and we will have to respond by putting a substantial portion of the increased revenue that the Commonwealth is going to receive into law enforcement activities. That's why this bill should be commended, because that's the problem that it tackles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the fortune to go on a delegation overseas last year. I went through Dubai airport. I had a look at the cigarettes to see what the prices were. I could have bought a packet—or several packets; it was three cartons packed together, and it was on special—of Benson &amp; Hedges for A$1.67 in Dubai airport. Yet the bipartisan policies of this parliament are going to increase the price of a packet of Benson &amp; Hedges up to $40 with the excise increases. Already—some may be able to inform me a little bit better—I understand a packet of Benson &amp; Hedges at the moment is around $25 in Australia, the highest price of cigarettes in the world. That, of course, can only attract black market activity, with such massive discrepancies in the manufacturing costs of a packet of cigarettes. You can buy them lawfully in an overseas country, which is a big difference from illegal drug smuggling, where illegal drugs are produced unlawfully in the country of origin, sold on the black market unlawfully and shipped unlawfully to Australia. The whole process is illegal, but, when it comes to cigarette smuggling and importation, the manufacture and sale of those cigarettes in the country of origin is a lawful activity. It only becomes unlawful when those cigarettes are shipped to Australia and a fraudulent customs declaration is made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see how this has fuelled the illegal activities of the black market from the work of the Tobacco Strike Team. In their first two years of operation, they seized more than 400 tonnes of illegal tobacco, worth more than $300 million in lost duty. The coalition were the ones that put forward the money to fund that Tobacco Strike Team, so it's very pleasing to hear members of the opposition suggesting that we should increase or continue the funding for that when it was the coalition government that actually put that funding initially. The Labor Party were the ones that introduced the original excise increases but did nothing to crack down on the increase of illegal activity, which anyone with common sense would have understood would be the natural consequence of such a policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this bill deserves support. We are increasing the penalties for illegal activity. We know that the illegal activities are going to ramp up every time we ratchet up the duties and the excises. Every time lawful cigarettes become more and more expensive, there'll be greater and greater black market activity. So, if we are going to go down that track, which is the bipartisan position of this parliament, we have to respond and put the appropriate resources into law enforcement to make sure they have the resources they need and also to make sure that the penalties are appropriate. That's what this bill does—it increases those penalties, and they do need increasing. I know in my electorate that you can drive to almost any suburb and go into a tobacconist and purchase an illegal packet of cigarettes for around $10—less than half the price of a lawful product. What will happen when we make the price of those lawful cigarettes $40? It will only, again, further incentivise the black market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is: is this having a great effect on the reduction in the rate of smoking? An article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 14 August last year noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The number of smokers in Australia has increased for the first time since anti-smoking campaigns ramped up a generation ago, casting doubt on the effectiveness of further taxes on cigarettes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An unexpected standstill in the national smoking rate since 2013, combined with rapid population growth, has pushed up the number of regular smokers by more than 21,000 to 2.4 million according to Colin Mendelsohn, an expert in public health at the University of New South Wales, who says Australia’s "punitive and coercive" policies to curb smoking have "run out of steam".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if we are going to continue to drive down that rate of smoking that all of us, whichever side of this chamber we sit on, want to see, this bill goes a long way to going down the track of increasing penalties, but we also have to acknowledge that a lot more needs to be done in this space. We need to look at what resources our Australian Border Force need. We need to continue the work of the Tobacco Strike Team to ensure that they are appropriately resourced. That is the only way we are going to continue to drive down the rates of smoking in this country. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E0F" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I would also like to congratulate the member for Hughes for being chair of the inquiry which looked into the need to investigate illicit tobacco. I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, which delivers on the 2016-17 budget commitment to combat illicit tobacco and criminal activity which the Australian Taxation Office has identified as a major resource for organised crime. In talking about organised crime, I go back to my time at the organised crime squad in Victoria. Just prior to my arrival, there had been a major investigation into the selling of illicit tobacco. Back in those days, it was basically a 12-month operation. Victoria Police spent so much money on it but never had the legislative power to actually have a successful prosecution. So, at the state level over 15 years ago, law enforcement made the decision that it was not worth going after those involved in the movement of illicit tobacco, because the penalties simply weren't there. Why do people get involved in this? As the member for Hughes said, it's simply to save on tax or avoid paying tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On another inquiry I was on, the serious and organised crime inquiry, the committee visited a Customs office location in New South Wales. The Customs office had done a great service and seized pretty much a container load of counterfeit cigarettes. I asked, 'Do you let these run and pick up the guys involved?' They said, 'No; the AFP won't get involved and the Customs officers didn't want to get involved.' So, basically, they just forfeited the container. The organised crime groups were very much focused on the movement of illicit tobacco simply because, when it came to the courts, it wasn't viewed in the same terms as, say, trafficking heroin, and the money they made was quite incredible. They bring in a container load of cheap counterfeit cigarettes worth maybe $200,000 or $300,000, but, by the time they sell them on the black market, they make $3 million. The organised crime syndicates accept that maybe one of four containers would be seized by Customs but, even with the loss of $300,000, they can make in the vicinity of $10 million with the other containers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great news is that the Australian Border Force has, in the last two years, seized 400 tonnes of illegal tobacco and prosecuted 45 smugglers. I very much congratulate them on that. There is a focus on this because law enforcement realised that there's money to be made here by organised crime syndicates and that's the only reason they're involved. Yet, even though we've had this amazing success, organised crime syndicates are very much involved in this. Australia's current high tobacco costs are especially noticeable when compared to Asia, where cigarettes can retail for less than $2 a packet. I believe this poses a serious challenge to our law enforcement processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are reports that the illicit tobacco market is increasingly linked to, and in some cases is even more profitable than, the narcotics trade—and this is true. I go back to a point I made before: if a container load of cigarettes comes in, the public view is that that poses a lot less danger than those who are trying to bring in, say, heroin or cocaine. The illegal trade involves a range of products, including loose-leaf tobacco, known as chop-chop; shisha tobacco, smoked in the Middle East; contraband in the form of stolen legally imported cigarettes; illegally imported foreign brands without Australian health warnings or any duty paid; and counterfeit products with fake Australian packaging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report by KPMG revealed that 13.9 per cent of Australian total tobacco consumption, or 2.3 million kilos of tobacco, was estimated to be illicit. The same report found that the Australian government is losing $1.6 billion a year to the illegal tobacco industry. That money could be spent on hospitals and looking after the Australian people rather than going into the pockets of organised criminals. The former head of the government's illicit tobacco task force, and now-retired former Australian Federal Police officer, Rohan Pike, estimates that the lost tax revenue figure is more like $4 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have the situation where a huge range of brands and counterfeit imitations are being sold illegally by small grocery stores and individuals across the country. Recently, Jeff Rogut from the Australasian Association of Convenience Stores noted that criminals were taking advantage of cigarette legislation and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For too long, criminals have taken advantage of the gaps that exist around regulation of illegal tobacco, and have literally been driving trucks laden with contraband through those gaps. The trade is booming—and cigarettes have become the most valuable commodity for crime gangs. Our stores and our staff are victims of terrifying smash and grab robberies on a daily basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have seen that in Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will provide officers with access to tiered offences. By introducing tiered offences, prosecutors have more flexibility to bring charges against persons who have committed an illicit tobacco offence. The tiering of offences is based on the quantity of tobacco and is aimed directly at the commercial illicit tobacco market, rather than individuals buying small quantities for personal use. Strengthened penalties will provide a stronger disincentive for criminal behaviour. That is very true. Criminals realise that if legislation and penalties are weak they will go for the easy option, especially if it's going to give them great financial return. A person caught with five kilograms of illicit tobacco will now face a fine of up to $42,000. A person caught with 100 kilograms of illicit tobacco can face a penalty of up to $450,000 or five years imprisonment. I like the imprisonment, because obviously selling that amount they still make a fair whack of money from it. A person caught with 500 kilograms of illicit can face a penalty of over $2 million or 10 years in prison. So the penalties take into account the seriousness of the offence and provide a deterrent to illegal activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also confirms that tobacco offences apply when the origin of the illicit tobacco cannot be established. From a law enforcement perspective, this addresses the current obstacle that where uncertainty arises it is very hard to know whether it is domestically grown or imported. It is a point of proof which prosecutions find very difficult to establish. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also believe the bill will have further benefit in that it will improve the health of Australia. Smoking is one of the country's most preventable causes of death. There are an estimated 2.6 million smokers in Australia and the habit kills about 15,000 people every year. That's 15,000 reasons to reduce Australians' exposure to tobacco products. I was listening on the radio the other night where they had a cardiologist talking about the main way of preventing heart attack. He said, 'Give up smoking.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is clearly an important component of our government's suite of measures to discourage smoking. In the recent government submission to the tobacco inquiry, Cancer Council Australia referred to the high cost of tobacco as being 'the single most effective method available for reducing tobacco consumption, increasing attempts to quit and reducing smoking prevalence, thereby reducing death and disease caused by smoking.' If we look at this from the point of view of the cost to the taxpayer, more than $30 billion is estimated to be spent each year on health, social and economic costs related to smoking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Illicit tobacco also creates a different picture around Australia's smoking rates. According to the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics national health survey, adult smoking rates fell from 16.1 per cent in 2011-12 to 14.5 per cent in 2014-15. The National Drug Strategy household survey shows a similar decline. But the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission's annual national wastewater survey, in which households' waste is tested for the presence of various drugs, tells a different story. Law enforcement agencies consider it more reliable because it's hard to hide what's in your urine. The commission's report issued in July last year from testing conducted over a six month period shows tobacco use nationally going up, not down. So obviously we're talking about illegal tobacco now. That means there's no room for complacency and greater urgency to implement this bill as further measures to discourage smoking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill as a whole will ensure there is a comprehensive set of offences aimed at stopping the importation, possession, purchase, sale and production of illicit tobacco. In addition, the bill makes it an offence to possess equipment used in the production of illicit tobacco—again, a very important tool for law enforcement. Police may not actually come up with the illegal tobacco, but if they get the equipment they can then seize that and charge people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are supported by the Minister for Home Affairs, who is doing a fantastic job. He will later introduce legislation to amend the Customs Act to strengthen illicit tobacco offences, which will complement the amendments contained within this bill. I therefore commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I am speaking on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018 today because I support reforms to the penalty and offence framework for illicit tobacco and our government's commitment to stopping the importation, possession, purchase, sale and production of illicit tobacco. This bill delivers on our 2016-17 budget commitment, and it will have a significant positive financial impact on revenue over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The estimate just provided by my colleague the member for La Trobe, who gave an excellent speech on this issue—he is a former law enforcement officer himself, so he really understands the issues involved—of the impact on our budget bottom line was something in the order of $1.6 billion. So that's a very significant amount of money. Without the measures this bill introduces to stop the supply of illicit and illegal tobacco, the tobacco black market will continue to operate and potentially expand. Without this bill, the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Home Affairs will continue to find it difficult to prosecute suppliers of illicit and illegal tobacco. The Black Economy Taskforce has recommended that measures be introduced to deal with this problem. Otherwise, people dealing in the trade will have an unfair advantage over businesses that legally sell tobacco, such as our supermarkets, service stations, corner stores and hotels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have a large illicit tobacco trade, we are also far less able to ascertain how many people are smoking, in what amounts and at what rates in our community. When we don't know this, how can we help people to quit? How can we identify where to target assistance and resources and which factors to look at that might be encouraging people to smoke cigarettes?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill for all the reasons I have just mentioned but also because we need to stand up for businesses that are obeying the law and selling tobacco products according to the law. We need to ensure that we do not continue to allow the illegal sale of tobacco to threaten our small, medium and even larger businesses that are losing revenue and downsizing their workforces, sometimes because of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a member of the Standing Committee on Tax and Revenue. The committee recently heard evidence from a range of business organisations on this very issue. We heard from Master Grocers Australia. Master Grocers Australia represents more than 2,500 independent supermarket and liquor retailers of all sizes employing more than 115,000 hardworking Australians. These businesses have a turnover of around $14.8 billion, so they are obviously very important to our economy. The chief executive officer of Master Grocers Australia, Mr Jos de Bruin, told our committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we have had great concerns about the illicit and illegal tobacco market. At first we did not think much of it or hear much about it but over a period of time we started to get a lot of feedback, as an industry organisation, from various states that it was becoming an issue and it was having an effect on the sales of tobacco in our member stores. Like it or not, it is a legal product. We spend a lot of money to comply. We spend a lot of money to train people to serve tobacco and so the rigor is just endless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have had some of our members quote figures of losing 20 to 25 per cent of their measured weekly sales, not knowing where those sales have been lost, only to discover that it seems to be illicit tobacco, tobacco that was found to be sold on Facebook or some other social media form that they discovered was affecting their sales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also heard alarming evidence about the rate of successful and attempted break-ins targeting tobacco products. The Australian Retailers Association estimated that their membership owned around 50,000 shopfronts and, of those shopfronts, around half stocked cigarettes and tobacco products. The Australian Retailers Association told the committee that, of the 25,000 or so shopfronts that stock tobacco products, almost all of them had had an attempted break-in. In fact, break-ins are now reported to be so common amongst businesses that stock tobacco that they can no longer get insurance or are forced to hire security at their own cost. For a lot of small businesses obviously this just isn't an option. This tells us that something has gone quite wrong with the sale of tobacco in Australia. Thanks to the work of the Black Economy Taskforce and the Standing Committee on Tax and Revenue, and thanks to the evidence provided by the peak industry associations and bodies who represent our retailers and businesses, and thanks to the information provided to them by hardworking Australians who are the owners and the staff who own and work in these businesses—and a lot of these businesses are small and medium retailers; they're often family owned businesses—we know that customers and consumers are turning to the black market, where cigarettes are so much cheaper that normally law-abiding citizens are willing to take the risk to purchase tobacco illegally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there should be, and there must be, a tax on cigarettes and on tobacco. The tax is designed to address the very well documented negative health impacts of tobacco. We know that we, as a government, must do everything to support people who use tobacco products, who smoke cigarettes and who want to quit. We know this is important for their health and for the health of our health system. Unfortunately, however, with the tax on this product it seems we have reached a tipping point where the rise in illegal and illicit tobacco sales is the unintended consequence of taxing tobacco at a rate that is now too high. I understand that in Australia now approximately 70 per cent of the cost of a packet of cigarettes is made up of tax. According to the Australian Taxation Office, cigarettes are subject to the twice-yearly excise increases on tobacco products. The increase is applied in March and September and is based on average weekly ordinary-time earnings. In addition, excise rates for tobacco will increase by 12½ per cent on 1 September this year and for a further two years until September 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill does obviously address the illicit and illegal tobacco market, we must also have a very careful look at the cause of this market. The current tax regime on tobacco products is not only making our campaign to address the very real health concerns and impacts less effective than it could be; it's hurting law-abiding Australian businesses and increasing costs that are ultimately borne by consumers. Mr de Bruin, the CEO of Master Grocers, told the tax and revenue committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have an issue in regards to the fact that we are losing sales, and sales are what keep our doors open. It is a very low-margin items for us. It is high turnover and low margin. Grocery is a razor thin margin so to lose any percentage of sale on any product will affect our profitability and our ability to employ and to be sustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just businesses that are suffering; it's also government. When people buy illegal or illicit tobacco, the federal government loses tax revenue, and, as I outlined earlier, the tax revenue that we are losing is significant. I believe that we all accept that tobacco products should be taxed and that this tax revenue helps to fund general revenue for spending on services, some of which include specific services related to tobacco and tobacco products, such as education and prevention campaigns. It also funds our health system for tobacco related health treatments. We are losing out on a very significant amount of tax revenue because we have reached the stage, as I said earlier, where the level of tax on tobacco has reached a tipping point. We've reached the point where a large illicit and illegal tobacco market has been the unintended consequence of the level of taxation applied in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to congratulate the minister on this bill. I support reforms to the penalty and offence framework for illicit tobacco and our government's commitment to stopping the importation, possession, purchase, sale and production of illicit tobacco. This bill delivers on our budget commitments and will have a significant positive financial impact on revenue over the forward estimates. Without the measures this bill introduces to stem the supply of illicit and illegal tobacco, the tobacco black market will continue to operate and potentially expand. We do not want this outcome. We want to know how many people are using tobacco so we can do everything that we, as a government, can to support people who want to quit. This bill will improve the health of Australians by reducing their exposure to tobacco products. It also helps to ensure that tobacco products consumed domestically are fully taxed and comply with Australian regulations. This bill is important for the health of Australians and for the health of our health system.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I start off by saying that, as a reformed smoker of nearly 30 years, I have a keen interest in this area. I gave up back in 2004. I look back at how addictive tobacco is. Doctors, clinicians and people tell me that tobacco is one of the most addictive drugs available to mankind. We know that tobacco causes illness, death, amputations and a whole range of things, yet the tobacco companies still spruik to try to sell to the public. They use every marketing trick in the book to attract new smokers to this dreadful drug, which has killed so many people over the years in this world. We know some of the tactics and tricks they use. For example, because of the advertising cut down and the push to ban tobacco not just here in Australia but around the world, they continually get high-profile movie stars to pull out and show a packet of cigarettes and light up in movies. In the early 1990s Sylvester Stallone was paid $50,000 just to pull out and show a packet of cigarettes in a movie. I will not name the brand, because I will never allow myself to name a tobacco product and give them a profile, but these are some of the tactics they use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very proud to be the chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing back in the 2010-13 parliament. I chaired the plain-packaging tobacco inquiry. During that inquiry we saw some of the tactics that are used on packaging. For example, some of the slimline cigarettes were obviously marketed to attract young females. Cigarettes in tins and other marketing products were to attract young males. We know that inhaling tobacco is a dying art either way—you will die from it one day or you will give up—so they are always looking at new tactics and how to get across to our youth especially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though we are supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018—I think it's a good way to go, and I have heard the arguments on both sides—one point we want to make clear in this debate is the coalition's continued acceptance of donations from big tobacco. It's an absolute disgrace that they are accepting money from a tobacco company. Members of parliament have to set the standard. These companies produce a drug that addicts people and will kill them in the long run if they continue smoking it. I sometimes ask friends of mine and others who still smoke: 'Who do you see smoking? Do you see anyone over 70?' It is very rare that you do because they have passed away at an early age because of the addiction to tobacco.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  text-decoration:none underline;" />We need to make sure that we don't accept from tobacco companies money that is given for public elections. It's really sad and unfortunate that the coalition continues to accept donations from the big tobacco companies. As I said, that is a disgrace. As members of parliament we should be setting the standard. After I had chaired the plain-packaging report, I've got to say that I went hard on the tobacco companies in all of my media interviews and everything I did because I had been a victim of the tobacco companies. Over the years I've developed very slight asthma from smoking. It's my own fault, but I don't want to see that harm being done to other people. During the 2013 campaign a whole range of money was donated. In 2012-13 Philip Morris donated in total $107,000 to the Liberal and National parties. The donations included $45,000 to the Liberal Party's federal branch, $25,000 to the National Party's federal arm and $6,100 to the Liberal Party division in the seat of Hindmarsh, to my opponent. I wonder why they did that. They didn't donate to any other seats; just to the seat of Hindmarsh. Maybe it had something to do with me making statements, claims and speeches in this place and the very antitobacco views that I have. Maybe that was it. This just shows you how the big tobacco companies operate. <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">I think the plain packaging legislation that was brought in was a great measure. It was a great measure in terms of ensuring that our young people, who the packaging was marketed at, wouldn't take up smoking. I seek leave to table the media report about Philip Morris tossing $100,000 into the coalition coffers, which was printed on 4 February 2014.</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  text-decoration:none underline;"></span></span>

Leave wouldn't be granted, because you wouldn't want the Australian public to see, individually, where they donated money and how much money was donated. It's about time the coalition—the Liberal Party and The Nationals—stopped putting money into their war chest from tobacco companies. This is an area that must be stopped as soon as possible. I would like to see the Prime Minister come out with a statement saying that he will ban all his party members and his political party arms from accepting donations from tobacco companies. </span>

The reason I have come to this view might be slightly different from others in this place, but it is a deeply personal reason shaped by some incredibly brave men and women I have been proud to represent in the course of my previous life, working as a solicitor and then later as a barrister in the legal profession. </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">It's appropriate at this point, talking on this bill, to acknowledge those incredibly brave plaintiffs, those brave men and women who had the courage to take on the unparalleled might of the tobacco companies in the courts. Whilst there are dozens of cases, I would like to take this opportunity to single out two. The first is a case of epic proportions, and there is no doubt it was a war. It was a litigation war waged by one woman, an incredibly brave woman struck down by terminal lung cancer and in the end stages of her life in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Her name was Rolah McCabe. I had the privilege to meet Rolah McCabe a number of times when I was a solicitor, and she was hopelessly addicted to tobacco. Rolah McCabe developed lung cancer as a consequence of her hopeless addiction, which she had tried to kick any number o</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">f times, but, sadly and tragically</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">, failed. </span>She had the great strength to instruct solicitors to bring proceedings against British American Tobacco for negligence for continuing to market a product that they knew to be potentially deadly in a manner which made the reasonable person think anything but that. This was back in the days when it was put upon consumers that smoking cigarettes was sexy or smoking cigarettes made you cool or smoking cigarettes could make you successful or more popular. Just like with the asbestos wars, the tobacco companies knew that was wrong and they knew that excessive inhalation of tobacco smoke—and, as I have already said, no-one has actually declared that there is a safe level—and excessive exposure to tobacco smoke could potentially kill you. Hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of people like Rolah McCabe all around the world succumbed to that disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rolah had the intestinal fortitude to fight British American Tobacco in the courts—and fight them she did. I will never forget working as a solicitor at the time, waging other litigation battles, where I had the privilege of working alongside fierce litigators like Peter Gordon, John Gordon, Andrew Grech, and Andrew Higgins, who I still remember as a young 20-something spending hours and hours in a tiny little office poring through the discoverable documents of British American Tobacco in order to establish the case that British American Tobacco knew or ought to have known of the risks to health as a result of their various advertising campaigns. It was Andrew Higgins, Peter Gordon, John Gordon and Jack Rush QC, as he then was, who came across a discovery. The discovery was that, notwithstanding the many, many years that preceded Rolah McCabe's case—of which her time was running short—the documents which they knew to exist which demonstrated on the plaintiff's submission that the tobacco companies knew or ought to have known of the risks of injury or death had disappeared. The documents had disappeared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Rolah McCabe and her legal team, as they then were, rushed to court given her very limited life expectancy and took British American Tobacco to court to have the defence that they had lodged struck out on the basis that a so-called document retention policy was put in place with either the intent or had the result of destroying documents which would otherwise assist the plaintiff in her case. That resulted in McCabe v British American Tobacco Australia (2002) VSC 73. I still remember the day the ruling was handed down on this case—a case in which Rolah McCabe was successful, in which she took on the tobacco companies and won, and on which the judge, the honourable Justice Eames, made the following finding at paragraph 263:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There can be no doubt, however, that within the defence camp the truth must have been known, that all 15 of the Cremona documents which the plaintiff sought, and many more, had been destroyed in 1998 …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the intention behind the so-called document retention policy, there is a self-serving policy document setting out that the purpose of the document retention is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… not a way of ensuring destruction of 'damaging' records or retention of 'helpful' records. Records will be treated as series, in large blocks. It is not the intention to 'spring clean' the files to remove or retain records on a selective basis. Any such action would prevent the Program from passing judicial scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the judge found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The paragraph constitutes a clumsy and self-serving attempt to declare innocence but at the same time, in my opinion—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">demonstrates the clear purpose behind the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The judge continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The determination to destroy all possible damaging material was so great that notwithstanding legal advice that an adverse inference could be drawn from the process of destruction, the programme proceeded anyway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The judge concluded that the 'destruction of records and the failure to keep a record of what documents were held, and when and when they were destroyed' caused significant difficulties to the plaintiff's case. On that basis, along with many others, the case against British American Tobacco was upheld, their defence was struck out, and Rolah McCabe became one of the first Australians ever to be entitled to an award of damages for her terminal lung cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interests of full disclosure it's appropriate to also say that Rolah McCabe's case was later overturned on appeal, but nothing will ever take away from her and her family those initial findings of the trial judge, in which it was very clear that tobacco companies went to great lengths to destroy documents based on self-serving advice upon which to further their case. That gives you a flavour of why, in my view, it is entirely appropriate to have the position, as ought be taken by everyone in this place—I'm sad that it is not the case—that we should be not having a bar of taking a single cent from a tobacco company in order to further one's ambitions to make a contribution in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That case preceded another landmark case. Again, it is an enormous privilege and honour to be able to stand in this place and place on record the fight and tenacity demonstrated by these brave plaintiffs who died as a result of their addiction. The other case was Ellis as the executor of the state of Paul Cotton against the State of South Australia and others. This was a case in which a lovely, hardworking, knockabout bloke called Paul Cotton, who had a couple of kids and a partner, Teresa Ellis, was exposed to asbestos, but he was also hopelessly addicted to tobacco. He contracted lung cancer. He died very quickly, leaving behind a very young family of three children and a loving and devoted partner, Teresa Ellis, who I had the privilege of representing myself. The case was brought against the asbestos companies and also against his former workplace, on the basis that his exposure to asbestos was sufficient to have caused or played a role in him contracting his lung cancer. It was an enormously complicated epidemiological argument about the multiplicative or synergistic effect of exposure to asbestos and tobacco. In this case the asbestos companies and the state fought tooth and nail against a widow who had barely a cent to her name, that I had the great privilege of representing on a pro bono basis. I will never forget this case for as long as I live. It took five weeks for the trial against three defendants. One of the defences that was waged against her, in terms of her quest for compensation, was that Paul Cotton contributed to his own death as a result of his tobacco smoking or voluntarily assumed the risk of doing so. That case was important in relation to the insidious effects of addiction and the role that that plays so that it isn't necessarily appropriate to simply say that, in all cases, people can just have the strength and willpower to kick the habit. Sure, that happens in some cases, but it doesn't happen in all. This case demonstrated, for the first time, that the addictive nature of smoking tobacco places the risk levels of those who want to give up but just can't into a very different category than one of simply an objective test. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to say that in that case the claim by the defendants that Mr Cotton voluntarily assumed the risk of smoking, and therefore he shouldn't be compensated for the asbestos-related lung cancer, failed. However, I'm also pleased to say, in terms of a reasonable approach, that the trial judge in that case did find that at the point in time in which Mr Cotton received medical advice from his doctor that he should start giving up smoking, in the point of time where he failed to do so, and from that point onwards, his addiction did play a role. At paragraph 739 of his reasons the trial judge said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I therefore accept that the issue of whether or not Mr Cotton's smoking may amount to contributory negligence must be answered on an objective basis without regard to any actual addiction or dependence upon nicotine, however real that may be in fact, as it appears to be in his case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's important. It's important, again, because the courts recognise that the insidious nature by which these tobacco companies prey upon these individuals who get hooked on cigarettes and have a devil of a time getting off them flies in the face of any pretence to be an upstanding or good corporate citizen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely appropriate that we maintain a firm view and do not tolerate in any way, shape or form any appearance or perception that this place should be tainted by the same stain that these tobacco companies inflicted upon hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians and those around the world who, as a result of their hopeless addiction, are heading perilously towards tragic illness or death. On that basis, I am very proud that we have maintained the rage in terms of refusing those donations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (National Housing and Homelessness Agreement) Bill 2017 seeks to legislate aspects of the proposed new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, which was announced in the 2017 budget. It provides a total of $4.6 billion over three years from 2018-19. That is all to the good, but the way in which this bill has been managed is yet another example of the chaotic and dysfunctional way in which this government operates. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it has a day like today. For such an important subject as a national agreement on housing and homelessness, you'd think this government could get it right. We are, after all, at a point at which the home ownership rate in Australia is at a 60-year low, a point at which, this Saturday, potential first home buyers will be beaten out by investors at auctions across the country. But, sadly, the government wasn't even able to get such an agreement as this right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced in the House of Representatives way back on 25 October 2017. You would think, given it is the Commonwealth's enabling legislation to put in place a national agreement dealing with housing and homelessness, that the government would have had the agreement of the states and territories. But what happened after the legislation was introduced was a complete repudiation of the approach that Treasurer Morrison has taken—so much so that the state and territory treasurers decided to form their own body which doesn't include the Commonwealth Treasurer. That is how dysfunctional this government is. It has forced state and territory treasurers, Liberal and Labor, to get together with their own body, leaving out the federal Treasurer, Treasurer Morrison, because of the way in which they've been treated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the impetus for that new body was that state and territory leaders were upset that this government and this Treasurer brought to parliament a bill for a National Housing and Homelessness Agreement before the deal had state and territory approval. The bill was introduced on Wednesday, 25 October 2017, and treasurers and housing ministers at a state level were supposed to negotiate on the contents of the agreement and the contents of the bill a mere two days later. When they were asked about this at Senate estimates, the Commonwealth Treasury confirmed the states and territories were not consulted about whether the tied funding agreements would be legislated and they didn't receive the bill prior to its introduction into parliament. That's not how you negotiate in good faith with the states and territories on any piece of national reform, let alone an issue such as housing and homelessness, which, as every watcher of federalism knows, is an issue that crosses the state-Commonwealth divide. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, only days before committing this extraordinary gaffe, the Treasurer had been championing the Productivity Commission's recommendations on closer cooperation with the states and territories. Treasurer Morrison told CEDA on 24 October 2017:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission is principally saying that as a Federation we need to work together better, to play nice, including on securing productivity gains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure what the Treasurer's definition of 'playing nice' is. I don't know what his notion of cooperative federalism is. But it certainly wasn't what the states and territories had dished up to them the following day. On 25 October a bill was introduced into this place to which the states and territories were supposed to agree two days later. It's just another in a long litany of stuff-ups and incompetence by the Abbott-Turnbull government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to legislate certain aspects of the agreement and, as I've said, provides a total of $4.6 billion over three years from 2018-19. Of this funding, there is just over $1.4 billion a year for housing related purposes, which is provisioned from the ongoing funding in the budget for the National Affordable Housing Agreement. There's also $375 million over the forward estimates to fund ongoing homelessness services. This funding is indexed and intended to be matched dollar for dollar by states and territories. The matched funding requirement is sought to be legislated in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Naturally, in the time available to me, I can't go into every single detail of the bill, but there are a couple of features that I'd like to point out. There is a legislated requirement for receiving financial assistance that a state or territory must have a housing strategy that indicates the level of housing supply needed to respond to housing demand and outlines the reforms and initiatives that will be implemented to meet this need, and a homelessness strategy that addresses priority homelessness cohorts identified in the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement and includes reforms or initiatives that contribute to reduction in the incidence of homelessness. Other matters, if any, specified in the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement or bilateral agreements must also be part of these strategies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to legislate a matched funding requirement. Financial assistance is to be provided to a state or territory on the basis that, for every dollar paid to the state or territory in relation to homelessness, that jurisdiction must also spend a dollar out of its own budget in relation to homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would note in passing that this is quite a different approach to federalism to what the Abbott and Turnbull governments have pursued in the case of schools funding, where they employed a no-strings-attached approach, tearing up agreements which had been made by the former Rudd and Gillard governments, and required states and territories to contribute $1 for every $2 of Commonwealth funding they received. When it came to schools, the Abbott and Turnbull governments saw no need to require that states and territories made an additional contribution when the Commonwealth put in additional dollars. But that principle fell by the wayside when it came to homelessness. I will leave the government to explain why its approach to federalism differs on these two issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also requires states and territories to provide to the Treasurer information relating to housing, homelessness and housing affordability matters as specified in the national agreement or a bilateral agreement in a manner or time ascertained in accordance with the main national agreement or a bilateral agreement. We on the Labor side of the House recognise there are issues and problems with the existing National Affordable Housing Agreement. Key benchmarks are not being met. Over a billion dollars a year is going out, and we recognise that a new approach is required. In April 2017, when Labor announced the next tranche of our housing affordability measures, we committed to work with the states and territories on a new agreement, including new performance and affordability measures. Based on revitalised Housing Supply Council information—the Housing Supply Council being a body abolished by the Abbott-Turnbull government, with its usual short-sightedness—Labor would work with the states to drive better outcomes in performance to achieve a real reduction in homelessness and housing disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also seeks to strengthen measures in the current agreement across the housing affordability spectrum, including planning reform, inclusionary zoning and accelerated release of state and territory government owned land for housing development. All of these areas of reform are crucial for lowering the cost and supply of new housing stock. So we do recognise that need for change, particularly around accountability and reporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate inquiry also heard concerns that housing and homelessness funding would be at risk as a result of this bill. Stakeholders such as National Shelter, Homelessness Australia and Melbourne City Mission all outlined concerns. The states and territories, represented by Victoria, pointed to the risks of the conditionality provision in the bill allowing for subjective assessments of state and territory housing and homelessness strategies to potentially determine the provision of funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also notable that submissions to the inquiry stressed the importance of tax reform. Why wouldn't they? Across the political spectrum, there are many who realise the importance of reforming Australia's uniquely generous tax concessions provided to housing investors. We have seen such calls from Liberals such as Mike Baird, former Treasurer Joe Hockey in his outgoing speech to parliament and Jeff Kennett. We have seen it from think tanks, such as the Grattan Institute. We have seen it from the Reserve Bank of Australia. We have seen repeated calls from organisations that are tax experts, saying, 'If you want to improve housing affordability, if you want to help with balancing the budget, if you want to ensure financial stability, you need to reform negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I noted earlier today, speaking on another bill dealing with tax and housing, the International Monetary Fund said in its latest article IV consultation with Australia:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the investment side, the combination of high capital gains tax discount rates and unlimited negative gearing can encourage leveraged real estate investment in market upswings. While similar tax incentives are also present in other countries, they tend to be more limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IMF went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The capital gains discounts on housing should be reduced and other tax incentives limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount haven't achieved their aim of boosting housing supply and encouraging the building of new houses. Their annual cost to the budget is over $10 billion. We have seen the capital gains tax discount subsidy growing rapidly. It is projected to double from $4.2 billion in 2013-14 to $8.6 billion by 2018-19. The cost of the capital gains tax discount is growing at eight per cent per annum over the forward estimates, a rate of growth which is more rapid than funding for research, universities, vocational education and schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax concessions have their origins in the 1999 introduction of the capital gains tax discount. Negative gearing was introduced during the Depression as a form of economic stimulus, but it is the interaction between negative-gearing and the 1999 capital gains tax discount. Prior to that, net rental income had been positive in some years and modestly negative in others. But, in the years immediately after, you can see the graph plunge into the red, as net rental income recorded by the Australian Taxation Office is consistently negative. In other words, landlords were consistently making a loss rather than a gain. That is not consistent with good investing principles. We should not be encouraging investors to put their money into assets which will lose them money on a recurrent basis in the hope of an upcoming capital gain. That is encouraging speculation. We also should not be encouraging investors to only put their money into housing. That is encouraging crowding into a single asset class, not the diversification that any sensible financial planner would recommend if someone came to them seeking investment advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the Henry tax review and the OECD noting that these tax concessions are skewed towards the most affluent taxpayers. On negative gearing, NATSEM estimates the top 20 per cent of income earners receive around half the negative-gearing benefits. The top tenth capture more benefits than the bottom 60 per cent. The only way one gets to the sort of calculus that suggests that negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount are actually great benefits for the poorest Australians is if one is to analyse the data based on taxable income—in other words, income after those tax concessions have been received. This has been referred to by one fact checker as a 'zombie fact', one that ministers such as the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services keep on repeatedly coming back with but that has simply been shown to be absolutely false. Economist Saul Eslake says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… after the Howard Government's 1999 decision to tax capital gains at half the rate applicable to other income (instead of taxing inflation-adjusted capital gains at a taxpayer's full marginal rate), 'negative gearing' became a vehicle for permanently reducing, as well as deferring, personal tax liabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will support this bill and its passage through the House. Getting this right is an important piece of public policy, and it is unfortunate that the government has thoroughly stuffed it up. We hope that the government is able to negotiate successfully with the states and territories to ensure that this agreement, the funding it provides and the outcomes that are sought are all successfully implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I flag now that Labor will be moving a detailed amendment at the consideration in detail stage that will specifically state that matters relating to the accuracy of the level of housing supply or the quality or effectiveness of the reforms and initiatives in state and territory housing and homelessness strategies are solely a matter for those states and territories. That amendment addresses the concerns the states and territories, and some stakeholders, had about the apparently conditional nature of the funding in the agreement that was tied to those housing and homelessness strategies. I also understand that the government will be moving amendments that also reflect concerns from the states and territories and some stakeholders, providing some certainty and clarity around the condition for payments in relation to the primary and supplementary housing agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a government which is willing to implement reforms across the board, which isn't simply interested in announceables and fig leaves but actually wants to make sure that we have reforms to our taxation system which are good for housing affordability. We have now in Australia a situation in which home ownership rates for young people aged 25 to 34 have fallen from 60 per cent to 48 per cent. First home buyers make up just one out of seven of all home purchasers, and Australia needs to do better than this.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMMOND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I was really struck by the government's announcements, both two days ago in relation to the new ministry and, more importantly, in relation to the reshuffle that occurred in December last year, because something appears to have dropped off the radar of almost anyone on the government side—well, one of two things may have happened. Either it dropped off the radar or it was just a convenient omission. I should take this opportunity to say that it was not all bad news, particularly in December. We saw, for instance, the most appropriate recognition of the hard work that the honourable member for Durack has been doing for so many years; her ascension to the front bench was entirely appropriate. But that might be a silver lining to what is otherwise a very dark cloud, and it's a very dark cloud because of this: a funny thing happened on the way to the drafting office, because there is no longer a minister for consumer affairs. I have many failings, and one of them is not paying attention to detail sometimes. But I looked at the list three, four, five times. It's gone, vanished like Houdini: no minister for consumer affairs. Now, that means either the government don't care about vulnerable consumers or they just find them to be an inconvenience—so much so that, if they just pretend they don't exist, the problem might go away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud to be part of a Labor team that not only championed reforms for vulnerable consumers through the introduction of the Trade Practices Act but improved those reforms with the introduction of the Competition and Consumer Act, annexing of course the Australian Consumer Law. All of those things were done by Labor governments for the benefit of vulnerable consumers. But it is not just us who are working for vulnerable consumers. I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge all the incredible hard work that the groups who champion the cause of vulnerable consumers do. In no particular order, they are CHOICE, who do a terrific job all around the country; the Consumer Action Law Centre, who do a great job, particularly in the financial space; my local team, Consumer Credit Legal Services, on Adelaide Terrace in Perth, which many, many moons ago I was once a member of; and all the other not-for-profit groups who stick up for and champion the rights of consumers every day of the week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the result of the government's omission? The result is telling and completely clear when you look at the litany of dropping the ball it has done in relation to vulnerable consumers. You may have heard me bang on ad nauseam about the way in which this government has pushed under the carpet reforms to protect consumers in the small-amount-credit-contract, rent-to-buy and payday-lending spaces. They just don't exist, as far as the government is concerned, notwithstanding the fact that it had legislation approved by its cabinet for introduction into this place—gone, absolutely gone. That does not happen on our watch. We have introduced such legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What else do we see? Today is the latest example of what happens to vulnerable consumers when this mob is left in charge. Every single day, the risk of injury increases as a result of faulty Takata airbags in vehicles. It was only today that we saw this government finally do something about them, although it was abundantly clear if not years ago then certainly by 16 August last year, when the ACCC said on the record, in response to questions from the House Standing Committee on Economics:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it's critical that the alpha airbags be replaced immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That should have triggered alarm bells. It should have triggered the Competition and Consumer Act. The minister had the power to stop it; the minister did nothing. Vulnerable consumers are left wanting every step of the way under this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Sadly, the state Labor government refuses to accept that there is an issue. Also, we have the federal Labor members, including in particular those involved with our recent inquiry in the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The shadow immigration minister, who would be Bill Shorten's immigration minister if in government, had the view that there's nothing to see in Melbourne; there's nothing to worry about; and there are no issues.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There was a reference to the Leader of the Opposition by an unparliamentary term. I would ask the speaker to address the Leader of the Opposition by his proper title rather than simply addressing him by his name.</span>

                  </a>  I didn't actually mention the opposition leader; I mentioned the shadow immigration minister. Okay, I'll take that back, but I raise the point—and this concerns me greatly—that the Labor members opposite get very excited and nitpick over the issue, when we've got victims in Melbourne. This week we had a mother who had a home invasion where a child was in the room and was in absolute fear. We've also had other incidents this week in the western suburbs, in Labor-held seats, which have been reported in the media, where Africans have broken into people's houses and assaulted them during home invasions with crowbars and baseball bats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Labor member opposite doesn't really care about this. Why? It's because it's happening in Melbourne. It's actually happening in the western suburbs and it's happening in the south-eastern suburbs. There was more of a minor incident in my own seat of La Trobe this week, but not for the youngsters involved. Their parents dropped them off at the Beaconsfield train station. They were waiting at the station to go into the CBD at 10 in the morning when a number of Sudanese youths got off the train. They robbed them, they threatened them and they intimidated them. This sort of behaviour must be stopped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for early intervention is absolutely key, and I made this point with our recent inquiry. I made the point two years ago that we need youth workers and mentors. We need to get in there right from the start to help these young people out, otherwise they lose hope and they go down into this world of getting involved in gang crime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, in our migration inquiry, we had TESOL Australia give evidence. The Australian Council of TESOL Associations—teaching English to speakers of other languages—conducted a survey in 2016. They received reports of federal funding for refugee students going to the states and into the schools' general budget rather than being in a separate account, so it's not being spent where it should be spent. When it comes to the need to have youth workers and mentors, I'm a great supporter of Les Twentyman and what he's trying to do. But, again, state Labor has failed to get involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now go to the migration inquiry. We actually had a specific term of reference:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee shall give particular consideration to social engagement of youth migrants, including involvement of youth migrants in anti-social behaviour such as gang activity, and the adequacy of the Migration Act 1958 character test provisions as a means to address issues arising from this behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the shadow immigration minister and Labor members on the inquiry had the audacity to say that recommendations 17 and 18, which refer to the character test, were clearly outside the terms of reference, when they were in the terms of reference. My view, and that of the Liberal and Nationals members of the committee, is simple: if you come to Australia on a visa and you commit a serious or violent crime, such as a home invasion, carjacking or sexual offence, you give up your journey to become an Australian citizen; you will have your visa cancelled and you will be deported. That's the view of the committee on this side. On the other side, Labor members—in particular, the shadow immigration minister—had the view: 'You know what? There's nothing to see in Victoria. There's nothing wrong.' Evidence given by the Crime Statistics Agency in Victoria was that one out of every 7½ aggravated burglaries is committed by someone who is South Sudanese born. The only way you are ever going to address this issue is to admit there's an issue in the first place. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263070" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I rise today to speak about my island state. There is a state election to be held on 3 March 2018. The incompetent Tasmanian Liberal government, led by Will Hodgman, does not deserve to be re-elected. I say that the Tasmanian Liberal government does not deserve re-election for a number of reasons. Firstly, this government has treated our public health system as a piggy bank. The first thing Will Hodgman did upon being elected was to cut $210 million from our public hospital system. The Tasmanian healthcare system has slid into crisis as a consequence of the mismanagement by the Liberal government and a failure to understand the importance of properly funding and resourcing our public health system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has campaigned primarily on the issue of health. There is no doubt the Tasmanian public hospital system is in crisis. There are significant delays in accessing our emergency departments; elective surgery waiting lists are unacceptable; and at my local public hospital, the Launceston General Hospital, there are have been significant difficulties in attracting and retaining specialist staff. In particular, the Launceston General Hospital has recently lost its head of surgery, and there is significant controversy with respect to the renewal of the contract for a visiting specialist orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Gary Fettke. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this Tasmanian Liberal government talks big about spending on infrastructure but fails to deliver on new projects and to argue Tasmania's case for federally funded infrastructure projects. Tasmania's share of the federal infrastructure budget has dropped dramatically. Blame for that should lie with the Turnbull federal Liberal government, but the state Liberal government bears responsibility for its incompetence and inability to argue the case for important infrastructure spending, such as tourism infrastructure, sewerage and water infrastructure, the Bridgewater Bridge replacement and other important strategic infrastructure. In question time today, the member for Grayndler asked the Deputy Prime Minister why his government's own budget papers show federal infrastructure investment in Tasmania will decline from $174 million this financial year to $53 million in 2019-20. He also asked why there'd been no federal government funding for a single new major rail or road project in the state in nearly five years. It is simply not good enough that the Hodgman Liberal government didn't even ask its federal Liberal counterparts for funding for many of these important projects until the current election cycle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, despite claiming that its government represents a model of financial responsibility, the actions of the Liberal government in the course of this election campaign speak completely otherwise. I can well understand how local sporting organisations, RSLs and community organisations appreciate being funded by a generous government as part of pre-election largesse. I also understand the attraction of projects like that announced for my electorate, including a new bridge across the Tamar River. However, everyone needs to be concerned that this Liberal government believes that a good government involves keeping the purse strings tight during a period of government and then effectively blowing the budget during an election campaign. The Liberals have blown nearly $1.7 million in their promises made to the Tasmanian electorate as part of their desperate attempt to cling to power. There is nothing sustainable, nothing strategic and nothing visionary about the Liberal Party's campaign commitments. They represent shallow, base politics, the politics of the pork barrel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians are entitled to expect better than this from their government and from those seeking to form a government. This is why Labor has taken a responsible, cautious view about its financial commitments to the Tasmanian electorate. Labor's unabashed priority is to fix the Tasmanian health system. Rebecca White's plan involves the investment of additional money and resources into the Tasmanian health system earlier rather than later. The Liberal response is to promise to invest money, including money to be spent in a prospective third term. The health crisis is an immediate issue, something which deserves priority. Tasmanian voters understand that the promise of expenditure which depends upon the re-election of a Tasmanian Liberal government to a third term in office is not a credible response to that present crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanian Labor has a different vision for Tasmania and for Tasmanians. Tasmanian Labor wants Tasmania to be the education state. Investment in our TAFE system and investment in our primary and secondary schools will improve educational attainment, and this will mean that more Tasmanian people will have better qualifications and skills to address the uncertainty of work in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a watershed moment for my state. It is an opportunity for Tasmanians to vote for a positive future and to vote for health and education.</span>

                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  At the outset, can I support the remarks made earlier in this debate by the member for La Trobe in relation to the scourge of gangs in Victoria. When I speak to constituents and other people in Victoria, one of the issues that are raised by them on a fairly consistent basis is the fear of violence within the community at a level which hasn't existed in the past. As you would know, Mr Speaker, from your electorate, throughout the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, but in the western suburbs of Melbourne as well, there is a fear amongst our constituents about the rate of carjackings, burglaries and robberies that occur in Melbourne at the present time, and it is a matter which needs to be addressed. The policy of 'softly, softly' policing, which has been in place in Victoria for over a decade now, has not worked. A zero-tolerance approach to the aggravated activities of the gangs is needed, and it needs to be backed up by the bail laws, which simply should not presume that a person automatically gets bail in the case of these types of alleged offences. Indeed, it needs to be supported by the judiciary in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My call is to the Premier and the leadership of the state government in Victoria to actually show that this is an important issue for ordinary Victorians who want to feel safe not just on the streets of Melbourne and elsewhere in the state but, indeed, in their own homes. When it comes to the point that people, particularly elderly people, are fearful in their own homes, I believe we've got a problem that really does need to be addressed. I commend the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Guy, and the other members of the opposition in Victoria for having announced a series of measures that they would take if elected in November this year to form government in Victoria. I didn't come in to speak about that, Mr Speaker, but I thought that what the member for La Trobe said about the situation in the state was important and that it should be reaffirmed by a fellow Victorian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to be able to support and recently announce a series of grants to local organisations under the Stronger Communities Program. These grants were to Doncare, the principal welfare organisation in my electorate, to purchase a crew van to assist with donation collections and to transport special-needs patients; to the Croydon Hills Men's Shed—which you'd be very familiar with, Mr Speaker—to construct a clean eating area there; to the Manningham Men's Shed to upgrade a walkway and replace old heating and cooling facilities; to Schramms Sports Club to upgrade kitchen facilities; to the Bulleen Templestowe Amateur Football Club to restore lighting facilities at the Ted Ajani Reserve and to purchase an electronic scoreboard; to the Coptic Orthodox Church in Templestowe to upgrade an outdoor area; to the Australian Air League to upgrade educational equipment—the Air League operates out of the RSL subbranch at Doncaster and is a very vital organisation for many young people involved in cadet and Scout-like activities; to the Friends of Warrandyte State Park, one of the major nature reserves along the Yarra River, for installation of a water system; to the Doncaster Cricket Club for building restoration and repairs; and to the Veneto Club—which is celebrating, I think, its 50th or 60th anniversary this year, having been founded for all of those people from the Veneto region of northern Italy who've settled in Bulleen and surrounding areas of my electorate—to upgrade the women's change rooms. This is important because, with the uptake of women's sport in football, whatever the code—in the case of the Veneto Club, the world game, soccer, but also in relation to AFL games—the upgrading of facilities, including change rooms, is obviously very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also receiving grants was the Templestowe Junior Football Club for lighting, the Templestowe RSL for the upgrading of their air-conditioning system, St Mark's Anglican Church for the construction of a community garden and meeting place and, finally, the Maroondah Council for the upgrade of change room facilities at Quamby Reserve to accommodate, once again, the growing female membership and participation in sport in that part of the electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Tonight I want to speak about one of the greatest challenges of our time—namely, the protection of and the provision of assistance to the rising number of forcibly displaced people around the world. While this is not a new concept to my electorate, a community that has played a significant role in supporting large migrant and refugee populations, the recent increase in the intake of refugees under Australia's humanitarian program has put a considerable strain on local service providers. With the arrival of refugees comes the need to ensure that we develop and provide settlement services that are both efficient and effective and are beneficial not only for newly arrived refugees but also for the economic and social wellbeing of our communities generally. To put this in perspective, the Fairfield City Council revealed that, on average, Fairfield receives 1,000 people annually as part of Australia's humanitarian program. This is more than any other Australian city. With one-fifth of the nation's refugees settling in the Fairfield area, local services have voiced a major concern about the lack of resources, funding and employment opportunities to integrate new arrivals—more than 7,000 over the last two years—into our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is pleasing that the government is taking action in the wake of the crises in Syria and Iraq, the government has not shown the same willingness to ensure that migrants are adequately equipped to properly integrate into the communities. Local health, education and other migrant based service organisations have warned they cannot cope with the rising numbers. Carmen Lazar, of the Assyrian Resource Centre, highlights the need to emphasise the role of community capacity building if we are to work towards reducing the demand of the one-stop-shop culture and address the major issue of secondary settlement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One organisation in my electorate applying a very innovative approach is the Great Lakes Agency for Peace and Development. Building on the agriculture background of the African states surrounding the Great Lakes region, the organisation has developed a resettlement program for refugee families in regional Australia. This program has been successfully implemented in a number of rural towns, including Tenterfield. I congratulate Emmanuel Musoni, Dr Nadine Shema and the GLAPD board for this great initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pleased to note that the Fairfield City Council has launched the Fairfield City Settlement Action Plan in partnership with 50 service providers and community organisations in a bid to tackle this very complex issue. Addressing this issue, and echoing the sentiment of many of the local service providers in the area, Frank Carbone, the Mayor of Fairfield City Council, went to the heart of the problem when he said: 'When Fairfield is resettling so many refugees for the nation, almost 7,000 over the last two years, there is an expectation that the government will do more to ensure that infrastructure and services are available to meet that demand.' Similarly, Liverpool, the other major city in my electorate, has seen a very significant increase in refugee arrivals. Kamalle Dabboussy, CEO of the Western Sydney Migrant Resource Centre, is concerned that local service providers have been stretched beyond breaking point due to the lack of certainty in resource allocation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One option worth considering in facing the global refugee crisis is a notion of community based sponsorship of refugees. This has been modelled in jurisdictions such as Canada and seeks to increase the number of refugee settlements in the community through financial and practical support provided through private sponsors, such as individuals, communities and faith based organisations. The Save the Children foundation highlights that such a program will not only ensure protection and successful integration of more refugees in Australia but also do it with minimal budgetary impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to take action to address the challenges posed by the increase in the refugee intake in my community and also to promote positive development in settlement services more generally. I also take this opportunity to thank all my local service providers for their tireless efforts in supporting our refugee migrants and ensuring proper settlement services are provided throughout our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Over the last month I've made several speeches in this place that focused on the fight to retain Bennelong last year. I've thanked all the volunteers and helpers who devoted their time and efforts, but I have just a couple of final thoughts that I would like to air. Firstly, I'd like to thank the people and the community groups of Bennelong. This by-election was a great inconvenience to a great many people—for which I have apologised and I apologise again—but the residents of Bennelong in the main took on the burden with grace and good humour. Many people may not agree with my politics—and that's fair enough—but the understanding and sympathy I got was humbling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bennelong is dependent on its wonderful community groups, which fill every social and welfare niche, from the Australian Asian Association of Bennelong and the Armenian National Committee, which look after the needs of our many diasporas, to Christian Community Aid and North Ryde Community Aid, which look after some of the most needy people in our suburbs. These wonderful organisations and many like them make a tangible difference to the livelihood of locals and the vibrancy of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very fortunate to have the support of many of these wonderful organisations. I know that this is not automatic and does not come with the job. Instead, it is earned, and I hope in the coming years I can earn the trust of these remaining groups through supporting them in the vital work they do. Regardless of whether I have had support here or not, I'd like to thank all of these groups for the access and acceptance that I received through the by-election. Much of the community was turned upside down, but you kept on going through the chaos, so thank you. This goes out to people like Helen Crouch, who didn't bat an eyelid when I brought a special guest and former member for Bennelong, John Howard, to the annual NRCA Christmas lunch, or Jason Koh, who bent over backwards to accommodate a Korean free trade agreement anniversary gathering at short notice while also putting together Sydney's most-read Korean paper. I'm grateful to every one of you, so thank you very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whereas everyone was welcoming and accommodating to me in Bennelong, not all corners of society met me with fairness or an open-minded approach to their views. Here I'm referring to the media, who misrepresented me and aggressively disrupted my family's privacy on a number of occasions. I'm not seeking to call out all members of the media. I fully accept that a strong democracy also needs a strong, even-handed media to keep it honest. Where I falter I expect to be called up on it, but there should be a line of privacy that must be respected and there should be a commitment to truth-based journalism. Conjecture and supposition is not news and should never, ever be treated like it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On one occasion early in the campaign some journalists were camped outside my partner's home waiting for me to leave. When the garage door opened they stormed into the property, uninvited, blocking my way and trying to get to me as I got into my car. I've nothing to hide from the press, so this invasion of my space and my partner's property was unnecessary, not to mention illegal on the grounds of trespass. It was galling to see these rules of law and common decency broken by the media with such impunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that raised headlines and comments that were anything but factual was regarding my register of interests. It was alleged that I had incorrectly filled in my interests statement. These allegations appeared on the front pages in the days immediately before polling day, at a time when they could do the most damage. I still have people come up to me in the street and berate me, having made the assumption that these reports were correct. This is hardly their fault, as the reports were written to indicate that I had breached rules. However, this was not only incorrect but also malicious and dishonest. I filled in my interests statement through direct consultation with the Clerk to ensure that it met every requirement before submission, but this did not stop certain dishonourable members of the press from propagating lies that suited their political agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I'm sorry to end on this note. It was a passionate campaign on both sides and had many low moments, but ultimately it was a campaign that demonstrated the fantastic qualities of everyone involved in the campaign, all of our supporters and, more importantly, the community, which accepted the by-election with good grace and is committed to working together to make Bennelong a better place. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Today I want to recognise the life of Jim Stott. James Stott, known to everyone as Jim, was a giant of lifesaving in bayside Melbourne. Jim spent much of his life in the ocean or as a servant of the many lifesaving clubs in Melbourne's south-east. Jim was well known and loved at the Chelsea, Edithvale, Aspendale, Mentone and Hampton lifesaving clubs. Though Jim gave his time generously in administration, being a board member of Life Saving Victoria and the Victorian branch of Royal Life Saving Society Australia, a Life Saving Victoria district supervisor, a district officer of 15 years, a club delegate and a radio panel member, Jim's passion was volunteer development. Jim trained generations of lifesavers in bayside Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim started his association with lifesaving in the 1940s when he joined the Chelsea Longbeach Surf Life Saving Club, gaining his Royal Life Saving Society Australia bronze medallion with reel and line in 1945. Jim had a lifelong passion for the ocean and later joined the Hampton Life Saving Club in 1985, where he held the position of vice-president. Jim was active in the Mentone Lifesaving Club from 1995 until his passing. At Mentone Jim patrolled and officiated for 17 years until 2012. His generous service to the Mentone community was rightly recognised with the honour of life membership at the Mentone Lifesaving Club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in recent years, when Jim was in his late 70s and early 80s, he could be found at a local lifesaving club, organising Nippers classes and doing his bit training the next generation of lifesavers. He was a frequent figure at the Mentone, Edithvale and Aspendale lifesaving clubs and was always willing to lend a hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago I swam in the locally renowned club-to-club swim between the Aspendale and Edithvale lifesaving clubs. The clubs held a minute's silence for Jim in tribute to his great contribution to local lifesaving. Jim's tireless volunteering was recognised with the Royal Life Saving Commonwealth Certificate of Thanks, the Royal Life Saving Commonwealth Service Medal, the Life Saving Victoria 10 years service award and the 2013 Life Saving Victoria Assessor of the Year award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I offer my condolences to Jim's wife, Helga, to his three children and to the Victorian lifesaving community. Jim was a much-admired club member and a legendary figure in the lifesaving community in the great electorate of Isaacs. I pay tribute to Jim Stott for his great contribution to our community. He will be missed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Today I provide an update on significant developments and continued advancement in the electorate of Groom. As the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government, I'm certainly focused on driving growth and opportunity right across our great nation. Regional Australia has so much to offer the rest of Australia if given the right tools and opportunities. Enabling infrastructure is the focus of the coalition government, and this year it has been well and truly delivered in my home electorate of Groom. We're putting in place the building blocks to ensure the Darling Downs continue to grow, diversify and prosper into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Groom in the last 12 months we've secured a new LifeFlight base, for example. This project is being jointly funded under the Building Better Regions Fund, with the government contributing $2.05 million and local businessman and philanthropist Mr Clive Berghofer providing $1.87 million to the same project. Road funding for the Groom electorate was in excess of $366 million in 2017-18, with upgrades on the Warrego Highway, continued building of the Toowoomba second range crossing and various other local road projects across the Darling Downs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Preschoolers in the beautiful township of Oakey will be amongst the first in Australia to be introduced to science, technology, engineering and maths subjects in the Turnbull government's early-learning pilot project. I got to see the excitement of these children and their teachers when I visited their class over the break.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Natural disaster resilience is being boosted as $2.7 million is put towards earthworks to protect the Toowoomba Enterprise Hub to the west of our city against flooding and a $300,000 floodplain risk management plan is being developed for Jondaryan, Maclagan and Quinalow townships. Men's Sheds have received funding to promote and support men's health and wellbeing, including in Oakey, Highfields and Pittsworth. And the federal government Stronger Communities Program has delivered over $140,000 to 12 projects in Groom under the third round of that program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister held a politics-in-the-pub-style event in the Groom electorate just over 12 months ago, and we captured a question from Maternity Consumer Network's Alecia Staines whilst she was there. It's been tremendous over the last 12 months to work with her and the network to achieve significant advancements in maternity healthcare planning with Minister Greg Hunt. Finally, the Prime Minister delivered his headland speech for 2018 from Toowoomba last month, such is the focus for our significant regional area.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Throughout the electorate of Oxley, there are many fantastic local schools with dedicated teachers and students striving to do their best. Today I'd like to particularly acknowledge the Springfield Anglican College for two recent outstanding achievements; firstly, the extraordinary achievement of being ranked the No. 1 school in Queensland for OP results, with 64 per cent of the college's students receiving scores of 1 to 5 last year. I pay tribute to the college principal, Darren Pitt, who said that, while the ranking was a pleasant surprise, the school staff and the teachers took the most satisfaction from knowing each student had worked closely with their teachers and support staff to achieve their potential. I'm proud to have a close working relationship with the Springfield Anglican College alongside the new state local member for Jordan, Ms Charis Mullen, who can attest to the hard work shown by school staff and students to achieve this fantastic result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also proud to recently help unveil the school's newest piece of artwork, inspired by the LOVE Sculpture and the HOPE Sculpture by internationally renowned artist Robert Indiana. The new artwork, which takes pride of place in front of the school, when you are entering the area, represents growth, community and celebration—a fitting testament to an outstanding school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is not all good news, because unfortunately, with the NBN crisis continuing to worsen in Oxley, more and more residents are being simply left behind. This includes the residents of Kauri Place and surrounding streets in Seventeen Mile Rocks. I joined them at an NBN street meeting last week to hear their frustrations at the mess that they have had to endure. With many surrounding homes already having access to the NBN, residents of Kauri Place and other nearby streets are stuck in an NBN black hole with no available connection, after first being promised by the Prime Minister that all residents would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. It's just unacceptable that the crisis continues to go from bad to worse. As late as December last year, NBN Co were unable to give a time frame for when these local residents would receive a connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, since the street meeting, I am pleased to say that the NBN Co, through an article in the local paper, have now committed to a time frame of connecting residents. Next month they will be assessed for their current speeds, with all residents to be connected to the NBN by the end of August. But it should not come as a surprise. It should not take a street meeting of local residents who have been let down by this Prime Minister and his second-rate NBN rollout to have their voices heard and their homes connected. As we know this week, if you live in Point Piper in a mansion, you get priority speed and priority service. And just yesterday we saw reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Courier-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mail</span> that more Queenslanders will have slower speeds. It's not good enough, and I'll keep standing up for my local residents.</span>

His service to the local communities of Wooli, Minnie Water and Diggers Camp will be missed. Brian has been the council's village maintenance man, responsible for keeping the streets, parks and public access areas clean for locals and visitors. The community got together last Sunday to farewell Fredo, attending a barbecue held at the Wooli rural fire shed. Carmel Young presented Fredo with a golden shovel to say thank you for his service, and Carmel also presented a nine 'carrot' necklace to Fredo's wife, Jane. I'd like to wish Fredo all the best in his retirement. I thank him for his dedication to our community over the last 15 years, including as a volunteer with the Minnie Water Rural Fire Service.</span>

In Kyogle, Bruce McKenzie received an OAM for service to veterans and their families. Bruce was president of the Kyogle RSL sub-branch from 2009 to 2015 and is a current trustee. In the Richmond Valley, Rod Kinnish received an OAM. He is the founder and president of the Evans Head Memorial Aerodrome Heritage Aviation Association and has also been with the Evans Head RSL and Community Men's Shed since 2009. In Lismore, Margot Sweeney and Geoff Hannah both received OAMs. Margot is a board member of several foundations, including Credit Union Foundation Australia, and has been the CEO of the local Summerland Credit Union since 1999. Geoff has been a master craftsman since 1973 and received his OAM for service to the visual arts industry through the production of furniture. One of Geoff's works is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yarralumla</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Cabinet</span>, which is located in Government House in Canberra. These people are all very special people who have made great contributions to our local community. I congratulate them all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  I can reveal today that Woolworths spies on its poker machine customers without their knowledge, keeps a secret database of personal information and uses that information to encourage increased gambling. This practice undoubtedly increases revenue, but it is also immoral, is possibly illegal and directly fosters increased gambling addiction. I know this because of two brave whistleblowers who previously worked for Woolworths. Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group is majority owned by Woolworths and has around 400 poker machine venues, with some 12,000 machines between them, including 150 poker machines in Tasmania. In all of these venues there are some staff who record personal information about poker machine players without their knowledge and share it electronically with the other venues. This isn't basic information; we're talking about things like jobs, the times people come in, favourite drinks, favourite football teams, whether they have a partner and what their preferred bet level is—and all to one end: to help staff better bond with patrons so as to keep people on site and gambling longer.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just need to listen to one of the whistleblowers to get the gist when he refers to 'predatory tactics', 'unethical' and wanting people to 'keep gambling for as long as possible'. We shouldn't blame the staff at these venues, because I'm told they well understand that the practice is deeply unethical. Indeed, the staff hate that they're being forced by Woolworths to spy on people and to use the personal information to increase gambling, even though this is creating new pokies addicts. In Tasmania, Woolworths own five poker machine venues, at which Tasmanians lose $10 million every year, including $4 million in Glenorchy, in my electorate. All of these Tasmanians could have their information shared with every other Woolworths venue in the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This makes a complete and utter mockery of the ridiculous claims being made by the poker machine industry in Tasmania as part of the Love Your Local campaign, because these revelations show that these aren't lovable local pubs but rather a very big business that shares its customers' most private details. They are not only big business but also part of a coordinated campaign to spy on unknowing patrons so that they can fleece even more money out of their pockets, including the gambling addicts, who make up 15 per cent of people who play weekly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's revelations demonstrate just how low the poker machine industry stoops to create addicts. We already know that this is an industry that is prepared to lie to the community, whether it's about jobs or the rates of gambling addiction, and now we know the industry is prepared to abuse the trust of its customers to make money. This is disgraceful behaviour and it should be called out.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  Today is the last day of summer, but the risk of death from drowning or serious injury from near drowning continues throughout the year. The 10-year average in Australia is 281 drowning deaths, and obviously every one of those is a tragedy in its own right. Twenty-three per cent of those deaths occur on rivers and creeks; 17 per cent occur on beaches; and 16 per cent occur in oceans or harbours. And, perhaps alarmingly, 74 per cent of those drowning deaths are males, and quite often alcohol is a contributing factor. More than a third of the drowning deaths in Australia occur over the summer months, but it's important to remember that 50 per cent of drowning deaths occur in autumn and spring, and we must remain vigilant around the water all year round.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to pay tribute to one organisation in particular which is completely focused on keeping Australians safe around water. The Surf Life Saving Australia movement is Australia's peak coastal water safety, drowning prevention and rescue authority. In fact, with 168,000 members and more than 300 affiliated Surf Life Saving clubs, it is the largest volunteer movement of its kind in the world. There is perhaps nothing more iconic in Australian life than the red and yellow cap of a surf lifesaver on one of our magnificent beaches. It's a unique not-for-profit community organisation which exists through community donations, fundraising, corporate sponsorship and, of course, government grants. Since Surf Life Saving was established in 1907, more than 650,000 people have been rescued by surf lifesavers. It's a proud fact among Surf Life Saving clubs that no person has drowned while swimming between the flags on an Australian beach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gippsland, we're very fortunate to have four Surf Life Saving clubs, which I support personally, at Woodside, Seaspray, Lakes Entrance and Mallacoota. I want to thank them for their service over the summer months. They're part of an organisation which performs more than 11,000 rescues across Australia each year and achieves 1.3 million volunteer hours on beaches. One aspect of the lifesaving movement which I am particularly proud and supportive of is the Nippers movement, the junior development program. I would argue that Nippers is the best youth development program in Australia today, taking children from seven and eight years old right through to 13 and 14 and giving them the opportunity to be challenged by surf conditions. They learn about first aid and develop teamwork and, without even knowing it, they develop a culture of community service. It's a great organisation that I think every one of the 168,000 volunteers should be proud of. I want to thank the surf lifesavers in Gippsland for the work they've done on our beaches over the summer months. I know they'll continue to do that until the Easter weekend, providing volunteer patrols across the holiday period. They provide a great service in terms of youth development but also in terms of the economic benefits they give to our towns, because people want to visit towns where there is patrolled beach. I thank Surf Life Saving Australia and encourage people to remain safe around the water.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  Simon Lewis, a lifesaver from St Kilda, has inspired not just my community but Australia—even many parts of the world—with his acts of bravery and compassion in the face of the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean. Simon's been a friend for several years and I'm very proud of his work, both at home and abroad. Like the rest of the world, the sight of the body of the three-year-old Syrian refugee, Alan Kurdi, washed up on the beach was a turning point for Simon. Not willing to sit by, he made a decision. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I thought to myself: 'Well I know how to save people, I know how to rescue people. Why am I not at the biggest humanitarian crisis of our generation, using my skills?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community supported Simon through crowdfunding, which in 2016 allowed him to set up a rapid response jet ski team on the island of Lesbos in Greece. This Australian impact on the refugee crisis would lead to over 3,800 refugees having their lives saved with equipment funded by Simon's supporters. This inspiring work led to Mr Lewis becoming a finalist for Australian of the Year and Victorian Local Hero of 2017, and he was awarded an International Life Saving Federation Citation of Merit in 2016. During the last half of August 2017, Simon joined the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, based in Malta. He was contracted as the No. 1 lifeguard for three rotations until September 2017, and he's been elevated even further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His remarkable achievements have seen him advance from local lifeguard to becoming the first Australian head of mission on the central migration route for the German NGO Mission Lifeline—a huge honour not just for Simon but for Australia. As head of mission Simon Lewis is responsible for the entire lifesaving operation, including all staff, refugees and stakeholders, on what was known as the deadliest migration route in the world. According to UNHCR figures an estimated 5,000 have died on that route. It is undoubtedly one of the hardest jobs in the world. Each time Simon returns to St Kilda, he tells us incredible stories, including of refugees giving birth on boats. He was forced to witness the death of 31 refugees, because his team would have been barred from participating and patrolling further. He has not been recognised by Surf Life Saving Australia or Life Saving Victoria, but he should be. It's worth noting that Simon Lewis was the first, and still only, Australian lifeguard to have worked both the central and western Europe migration routes for the refugees. There are differences of opinion in Australia about how we deal with the issue of refugees. It's a passionate and often heated debate. However, I think we can all agree that the humanitarian efforts of Simon Lewis are worthy of our support. I know he doesn't do it for awards or attention; he does it purely out of compassion. He takes a vast amount of his time away from his normal life in my electorate and is out there in the Mediterranean saving people's lives. What a great Australian.</span>

The Young Citizen of the Year, Sina Aghamofid, is part of the Hills Youth Army and the Youth Volunteer Force, and recently joined the headspace Youth Advisory Council in order to help tackle the stigma surrounding mental health by increasing mental health literacy. One of our Senior Citizens of the Year, Noreen Tait, has been a volunteer with Wirreanda Retirement Village for 18 years and has worked with the RSL sub-branch in Wirreanda, which has grown to include ex-servicemen and women who help facilitate Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies. The other, Carol Baker, known to so many of us, has been a volunteer in The Hills for over 20 years, helping so many charities raise enormous amounts of money for worthwhile causes. Zoe Graham, our Citizen of the Year, co-founded the Hills Relay Ball, which has raised more than $400,000 for the Cancer Council over the last 11 years, and has participated in many charity missions overseas. She is a fantastic person who has also taken the time to participate in a school P&amp;C and The Hills safety committee.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our Community Groups of the Year, Computer Pals for Seniors, is a non-profit organisation consisting of 60 dedicated volunteers providing ongoing and valuable technological skills for all seniors with the aim of enabling them to become proficient in computing—and I'm sending my dad their way! The other is the Gazelles Netball Club, which has run the Gazelles Empowerment Program over the past four years, which utilises the power of sport to improve players' physical and mental wellbeing by creating an inclusive environment and encouraging a sense of belonging. These sessions focus on self-assessment, self-awareness, team dynamics and teamwork. This is a great model, and I praise the Gazelles Netball Club on the work it is doing and the innovation it is showing in this field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mayoral Commendation Awards for Senior Citizen of the Year went this year to Lyn Bull, who dedicates her time in a voluntary capacity, helping students of Baulkham Hills North Public School to improve their reading, literacy and numeracy skills; and to Jennifer Crouch, who donates her time to help so many students improve their reading skills as well. The Mayoral Commendation for Citizen of the Year this year went to Azita Abdollahian, who volunteers her time to help homeless people by providing food and clean clothes and cutting their hair and is a strong advocate against abuse, including domestic violence. She is a fantastic citizen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another collection of fantastic people received OAMs in our honours awards, including David Sansoni; the late Glenys Chapman of Kellyville, for service to nursing and outreach programs at the Sydney Adventist Hospital; Philippa Lovely, for service to the community through the Riding for the Disabled Association NSW 'Tall Timbers' Centre, which I'm privileged to have in my electorate; Moya McGuiness, for her service to education; and Gerald Anderson, for service to welfare organisations. Evelyn Lester, the commander of our SES in The Hills, received an Emergency Service Medal for distinguished service throughout her years at the SES. I pay tribute to Evelyn, as we do regularly, and I look forward to the awards ceremony coming up in a few weeks.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate in a big way Eddie Woo, who was named Australia's Local Hero for 2018 at the Australian of the Year Awards. As the head mathematics teacher at Cherrybrook Technology High, he started innovative video tutorials—a fantastic Australian and a great contributor. Eddie is a champion of our community, and I praise him.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I rise to speak about the utter contempt the New South Wales Liberal government have for the Hunter region. First they privatised our port after promising us 50 per cent of the proceeds of the sale. They got $1.7 billion for it. Did we get $850 million? No, we got less than $500 million. Second, they privatised our bus service, which has seen a significant deterioration in the service. I was at a protest meeting at Belmont 16s sailing club last week, where over a thousand people packed into the room and 200 people were turned away—so 1,200 people—to protest the bus route and timetable changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John from Caves Beach talked about his disabled daughter, who, instead of catching one 40-minute bus to her support service in town, has to take three buses, and the journey now takes one hour and 40 minutes each way. He talked about the impact this is having on his disabled daughter. Jack, a high school student from Swansea Heads, now has to leave home at 5.30 am to get to an 8 am class. God knows how he is going to compete in the HSC given these long hours. A young mum talked about being turned away from buses because they weren't pram accessible. Bec very bravely talked about her daughter in Warners Bay. They used to have a 40-minute bus ride to her daughter's school in town. Now they have to catch a bus at 6.30 in the morning, go to Mount Hutton, wait at the shops for 48 minutes and catch a second bus, only to arrive at school at 8.30 am. A 40-minute journey is now a two-hour journey. Bec talked about how this 11-hour day was just too long for her little girl trying to go to school each day. We also had a senior who is vision impaired talking about having to walk across eight blocks of broken ground without footpaths or traffic lights to get to the new bus stop. I've had pensioners contacting my office saying they moved into retirement villages because there was a bus stop right outside the retirement village, meaning they could still get around, and that bus stop has now gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why am I raising this? This is the Commonwealth parliament, not the state parliament, but every Labor leader in my region—councillors, mayors, state MPs and federal MPs—is united in fighting a rotten state government and their contempt for the Hunter region. They have shown nothing but contempt and arrogance for a region that is enormously important to the New South Wales economy and has over 750,000 people living in it. They treat it with contempt. What do they do with all the spoils, all the economic wealth, that we provide to the state? They waste $2½ billion building two new football stadiums in Sydney. That demonstrates the contempt they have. They cut buses, they cut services and they try and privatise hospitals in my region so that they can build stadiums in Sydney. What an utter disgrace. I condemn Gladys Berejiklian and the New South Wales Liberal government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ABBOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I rise today to celebrate the life of Michael Crouch, Companion of the Order of Australia, who has just left us. We Australians don't often think of ourselves as a manufacturing powerhouse, but, thanks to Michael Crouch, Australia is the world's largest supplier of instant boiling water machines. Michael's great insight was that you wouldn't succeed merely by doing what others did. So he did something that no-one was doing then: he created a machine that would deliver instant boiling water, and now, thanks to Michael Crouch, there are billions of conversations right around the world every day at the Zip water heater in just about every workplace. Michael started exporting Zip products 35 years ago and now these products, still manufactured in Condell Park in Sydney, are sold in more than 70 countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Crouch wasn't just a great industrialist; he was a great philanthropist, too. The good causes he supported included the Duke of Edinburgh awards, involving more than 30,000 young Australians every year, Symphony Australia and the National Biography Award. He supported medical research. He supported water and soil conservation, technical innovation and higher education. He was unashamedly pro-business and unashamedly pro-Australian—not for him the black-armband view of our history. Unsurprisingly, this also made him a strong supporter of the Liberal Party. He wasn't just a friend in good times; he was a friend when you really needed one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for each generation is to be at least as good as our forebears, and in Michael Crouch we certainly have someone to look up to. His life should be both an inspiration and a reproach. It should inspire us to believe that our best days are still ahead of us, but it should reproach us to put service before self. He's gone but certainly not forgotten, and he deserves to be remembered on our country's most enduring record.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I'd like to thank the members who have contributed to the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Deregulation and Other Measures) Bill 2017. The bill will amend a range of telecommunications and broadcasting legislation to reduce the regulatory burden on the broadcasting and telecommunications industries. The bill will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to remove duplicative requirements for licensees, publishers and controllers to notify the Australian Communications and Media Authority of certain changes in control. It will deliver a single classification scheme for all television programs by removing the requirement for certain television broadcasters to apply a separate classification scheme for films when developing industry codes of practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of telecommunications, the bill will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 to enable a transition to an industry based scheme for the management of telephone-numbering resources, subject to strict policy safeguards. The amendments have the potential to enable greater efficiency and innovation if industry develops a suitable scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also remove unnecessary arrangements for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to issue tariff filing directions to certain carriers and carriage service providers under part XIB<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The information captured by these provisions is readily available to the ACCC through other avenues, including through public sources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will reform the statutory collection powers of ACMA under the Telecommunications Act 1997 and of the ACCC under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to ensure that the information collected from industry is relevant and serves a useful public policy purpose. The bill will also simplify the annual report publication requirements for ACMA and the ACCC by requiring the reports to be published online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also abolish the requirement for ACMA to consult with an advisory committee specially established under the submarine cable protection regime before declaring, varying or revoking a submarine cable protection zone, reducing administrative costs and on the basis that ACMA must consult publicly anyway on such proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 to repeal the power of NBN Co to issue a statement that it is not installing fibre in a new real estate development, as it is not appropriate for NBN Co, as an industry player, to exercise a quasi-regulatory power. Changes will also be made to the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 to allow NBN Co to dispose of surplus goods without altering the fundamental line of business restrictions on NBN Co.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, as now amended to repeal schedule 2, will preserve the status quo for ACMA's broadcasting, content and datacasting complaints-handling and investigation powers under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Amendments to be made to schedule 3 of the bill will also align it with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Act as it was enacted in August last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments to be made to schedule 4 of the bill will provide clarity to commercial broadcasters that the pro rata refund of tax imposed on the issue of a transmitter licence only applies to the amount paid in the financial year ending on 30 June 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An amendment will also insert schedule 9 into the bill to ensure that a transitional support payment for the switchover to the commercial broadcasting spectrum tax goes to the intended party. The schedule ensures that Network Investments Pty Ltd and not Northern Rivers Television Pty Ltd will receive the transitional support payment under the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Act 2017. This recognises that Network Investments Pty Ltd held the relevant licence at the time of the passage of the broadcasting reform act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill will make other amendments to remove redundant and unnecessary legislation, including repealing over 50 spent acts in the Communications portfolio. The bill is a further step in this government's ongoing commitment to boosting productivity by reducing onerous regulation while maintaining consumer and competition safeguards. I call on members to support the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I thank the opposition for engaging constructively with the government on this bill and these government amendments. The proposed amendments on sheet KN135 will modify schedule 3 in the bill to align it with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Act 2017. As introduced, the bill contained two sets of consequential amendments to part XIB of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 that were contingent on the commencement of the misuse of market power act. This was because, when the misuse of market power act was introduced as a bill into parliament, it proposed to amend the same provisions in part XIB as this bill. As the timing of the passage of the bills was uncertain, contingent amendments were included in the bill to address different timing scenarios.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The misuse of market power act was enacted in August 2017, with amendments such that it does not amend the same provisions in part XIB. As a result, the relevant consequential amendments in the bill are no longer contingent on the misuse of market power act. The amendments reflect the original intention of the bill to be aligned with the misuse of market power act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendment on sheet KN136 will remove schedule 2 from the bill. As introduced, schedule 2 streamlined two separate and distinct frameworks for the broadcasting complaints-handling and investigation functions of the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA, under the Broadcasting Services Act. Due to a recent Federal Court decision, the complaints-handling framework was found to unnecessarily duplicate the investigation framework. As a result, the government considered the complaints-handling framework redundant, and schedule 2 would have repealed the framework. The schedule also introduced minor consequential amendments to create a combined complaints-handling and investigation framework, which better reflected ACMA's current complaints-handling procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of members of the broadcasting industry expressed concerns with the amendments contained in schedule 2. The opposition has also indicated concerns with this schedule. In order to not delay other, non-controversial, reform measures, the decision has been made to remove schedule 2 to the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendment on sheet GX170 will correct a provision of the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Act 1983, which was inserted by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Act 2017. The provision entitles a person to a pro rata refund of tax imposed on the issue of the transmitter licence if particular criteria are met. The intention is that the pro rata refund only apply to tax on transmitter licences paid in the financial year ending on 30 June 2017. However, this intention is not properly reflected in the provision and, if unamended, could result in higher payments to some commercial broadcasters than was intended. As such, the amendment will ensure that the provision operates as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the proposed amendment on sheet GX 170 will replace Northern Rivers Television Pty Ltd with Network Investments Pty Ltd as a specified company eligible to receive a transitional support payment under the broadcasting reform act. This payment supports commercial broadcasters in transitioning from commercial broadcasting licence fees to the new spectrum tax. To be eligible for payment, recipients must hold a commercial television or radio broadcasting licence. However, on 1 June 2017, after the introduction of the relevant legislation, Northern Rivers transferred its commercial television broadcasting licence and assets to Network Investments, making it ineligible. The government was only made aware of this transfer after passage of the relevant legislation. The amendment will specify Network Investments Pty Ltd as an eligible company. This recognises that Network Investments held the relevant licence at the time of the passage of the broadcasting reform act and will ensure that it receives a transitional support payment to support the relevant broadcasting licence as intended. I commend the amendments to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018 and support it. It's one that I think is long overdue and one that will make a real difference to the lives of thousands of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no greater honour than to serve your country. The sacrifices that Australian men and women make for our country are truly remarkable. In fact, in some cases, unfortunately, there is the ultimate sacrifice. All too often they are away from their loved ones for long periods of time, missing birthdays, missing anniversaries, missing family gatherings and so on. I would like everybody in the chamber here just to think about that. The reality is that they spend a lot of time away from family, missing all these milestones, and it's very hard on both the serving member and, of course, the families and friends. Imagine having to say goodbye to your loved ones—your wife, your husband, your partner, your children, your parents, your friends—every three, six or 12 months, not knowing whether you will actually see them again or whether they will see you. This is a reality. This is what we're asking our men and women in our armed forces and their families to do on a very regular basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly proudly served in the Royal Australian Air Force between 1969 and 1978. I know there are other members in the House that have served a little bit more recently than me, but nevertheless those nine years were very special to me. It was a time when men like me weren't encouraged to talk about our feelings in our time in service. You were simply told to suck it up. Thankfully, the times have very much changed—and so they should. I have to say, however, that it was a time in my life I was extremely proud of and have fond memories of, especially of the mateship and the camaraderie during that period of service. But what happens when your mates aren't there anymore 24/7 and you find yourself back in a life that you really don't recognise? It is a far too familiar story for many veterans as they return from active service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that active service has changed dramatically over a period of time. If you go back to the early days of the Australian Defence Force, people went on ships to the Boer War, the First World War or the Second World War. They would be away for a year or sometimes longer, and, if they were the lucky ones that returned, that would be it. They would have had their service, whatever that period of time was, and they would settle back into their lives. I remember great-uncles of mine that came back that were gassed in the First World War and the challenges that they had. They had their family with them for the rest of their lives, albeit lives that were cut quite short because of their experience. Going to Vietnam was a different situation again. Those that served in Vietnam went over there generally for six months, a year or two years. It was unusual to do two or three rotations; generally they would do one and they would come back, and that was their service. Again, they were faced with a lot of difficulty, a lot of hardships and a lot of things that people shouldn't have to see, but nevertheless they were home with their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these more modern conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, we are asking people to go back not just once or twice; they are getting seven or eight rotations. Just imagine how that impacts people. It hardens their thoughts—the things that they see and the most difficult of experiences. I have been fortunate enough to go over to the Middle East and see some of the areas where we are sending our troops—the most inhospitable of areas. No level of support while they are over there can really compensate for what they see and what they experience. They come home for short periods of time and then they are back there again. So it is backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards. This is bottled up inside them. I have to say that, for the time they are there, the comradeship is so important because they are totally relying on their friends to have their back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many struggle now when they come back. They did in the past, but it is even more profound now because of the multiple experiences. They really struggle to adjust to normal life. They are unable to get their heads around many of these trivial issues that society is consumed with at the moment, like traffic congestion, petrol prices and who won the footy. These things are really quite irrelevant to them. How could they not be? They witnessed firsthand the brutal horror of war. They feel very much out of sync with society. Many believe that the hardest thing about war is coming home and trying to adjust. Many of them have lost their mates, many were horribly wounded and many have witnessed things that those back home simply could never, ever fathom. Sadly, many come home broken people. Many come home different people. Many simply just don't come home. I see it often. People disappear as far as they can, away from civilisation, to try and come to terms with their experiences. This is where we as a government need to step in and give those veterans and, importantly, their families a helping hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is part of the significant work the Turnbull government is undertaking to make things better for our veterans and their families. I would like to focus on two of the initiatives contained within the legislation. Firstly, the family support aspect is a critical aspect that will allow families that are going through a tough time to keep their heads above water. Families and loved ones are often forgotten and silent victims in all of this, and they deserve the same support that we offer our veterans because in many ways they are also veterans in this experience. They're the ones who have to deal with the stranger, in many cases, who is living under their roof. The measures contained in the legislation recognise the crucial role of family in supporting veterans in transition back to civilian life. The legislation will deliver improved family support to veterans in receipt of an incapacity payment. It will include key psychosocial interventions, such as greater access to child care and counselling, to enable the family unit to maintain its connections to community and employment and also social interaction. More importantly, spouses of veterans who have been killed in recent conflicts or who take their own lives following their service will be eligible for childcare assistance, household services and counselling to assist them to adjust to life after the death of their partner. Under this legislation, they will receive childcare assistance until the children have completed primary education. Importantly, they will also be able to access counselling for a period of up to two years after their partner's death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second aspect of this legislation that I would like to talk about today is the veteran payment initiative. Approximately 830 veterans and their partners across the country will benefit from this payment in the first year, including those living in my electorate of Leichhardt. Under this legislation, the government will introduce a new income support payment to assist vulnerable veterans until their claim for liability for a mental health condition is fully determined. This payment will allow our veterans early access to financial support and provide them with vocational and psychosocial rehabilitation, including financial counselling and budgeting. This is so very, very important for people coming back and for families identifying that stranger who has come back, who is certainly not the same person who went across to serve, and who is trying to come to terms with their experience. Sometimes there is quite a long gap, and its important that during this process they get some sort of support, because a lot of these experiences are very, very debilitating for those involved. The fortnightly veterans payment of $994 for singles or $774.20 for each member of a couple will provide a source of income—relatively modest but, nevertheless, a source of income—that they can access until their claim is determined and ongoing support is arranged. In addition, eligible veterans will be able to receive rent assistance of $133 per fortnight. Those with dependent children will receive family tax benefit from the Department of Human Services without having to satisfy the means test applying to those payments. Again, it is very important that we have this support accessed very quickly and without complexity, because they are already dealing with a lot of challenges within their own home. It's my belief that these payments are particularly important because they give our veterans and their families a financial security while they deal with more important and pressing issues. The last thing these families need at this time is to deal with bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mahatma Gandhi once said that the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members. Not a truer word has been spoken, and it's extremely relevant when we are talking about those Australian men and women who have bravely served our country and might need a little help when they come home. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  There are some things which I strongly believe shouldn't become tools for political games. I believe that veterans' affairs is one of those things. The lives and livelihoods of those good people who have served our country are worth far more than a few points on the political scoreboard, so I'm very happy to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018 in the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Longman, I am really fortunate to represent a very large and strong community of veterans, veterans who have served across a number of wars and conflicts. Some have returned recently, of course, and many of them have made their homes in places like Narangba. Others have already spent many years at home and lived as civilians right across Longman, with a very large group of those civilians living in Bribie Island. I think it is incredibly important then that we support those brave men and women whenever we can. There are already some incredible services available to the veterans who live in Longman and call Longman their home, like Remembrance House in Burpengary. I have visited there many times. I remember that just last year on Anzac Day I was fortunate enough to be invited with the veterans to have a gunfire breakfast immediately after the ceremony. But I also visited there last year with the shadow minister for defence, Richard Marles, and we had a long and in-depth conversation with both our Vietnam veterans and some of our newer veterans who live nearby in Narangba. We have other great services like the RSL club and its sub-branches at Bribie, Beachmere and Caboolture-Morayfield. But these services can only provide so much assistance. It is really the role of parliament to support those who put their lives on hold and go and serve our nation. We have a duty of care to uphold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill comprises eight schedules that were mostly recommended by the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. Labor believes that one suicide is one life lost too many. So we supported, of course, the establishment of this inquiry to explore the issues faced by our returned Defence personnel. Disappointingly, this was an inquiry that the coalition opposed. I say 'disappointingly' because I don't know how any government member could be against finding out why so many of our returned service men and women have, tragically, taken their own lives. I don't know why anyone would stand in the way of that inquiry, which could and actually did find solutions to this deeply saddening issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is proof of just how valuable that inquiry was. It is proof that the experiences of individuals and interested organisations collated in over 400 submissions helped shape this very, very important legislation. Over the year that that inquiry ran, a number of issues were highlighted, and I will pick up just three: the impact of financial stresses; the adversarial and lengthy claims processes; and the lack of support for the partners of our veterans. Of the 24 recommendations made by this inquiry, the bill seeks to address two main areas. They are the interim incapacity payments for mental health and greater support for our veterans' families. Labor has been actively pursuing greater support for families for some time, so it is very, very welcome to see this featured in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill seeks to provide additional support for the families of current, former and deceased members of the Defence Force by providing additional childcare arrangements, counselling, household services and, of course, attendant care. The additional childcare assistance will see families eligible for up to $10,000 each year to cover the cost of child care and before- and after-school care. It is pleasing to see the government taking on these initial steps, and here's hoping they maintain that momentum. And I urge the government to consider a number of initiatives such as Labor's family engagement and support strategy for Defence personnel and veterans, which goes a little further than this, because that strategy actually will provide a national blueprint to include engagement of DVA and Defence with military families. This strategy will ensure that those who serve and their families will have access to best-practice support consistently available right across our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to flag schedule 2 of this bill, which I strongly support. Schedule 2 of this bill goes to those people who are waiting for their mental health claims to be determined. Schedule 2 establishes a veterans payment. Acting as an interim income support payment, the veteran payment has been established in response to the outcomes of the Senate inquiry into the tragic suicide of Afghan war veteran Jesse Bird. Jesse Bird, a soldier and combat veteran, died last year after losing a claim for a permanent impairment that he had been pursuing for almost two years. Jesse Bird had warned the Department of Veterans' Affairs that he was suicidal. He had warned them he was under severe financial stress. When soldier Jesse Bird died he had just $5.20 left in his bank account. I welcome schedule 2 of this bill, because this veteran payment will seek to ensure that a tragedy like the death of Jesse Bird doesn't happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a form of interim income support payment that is available between lodging a mental health claim and then the claim being determined, the applicant is entitled to a basic rate of $913, or $713 if they are a partnered person. In addition to this, a person may also be eligible for a pension supplement, rent assistance, family tax benefit and a remote area allowance. These payments are subject to satisfying an asset and income test and, importantly, also require the applicant to engage in vocational and psychosocial rehabilitation, including some financial counselling. Veterans' partners may also be eligible for this payment, and the payments will continue to be provided in the circumstances where both the veteran and their partner are receiving a payment and the veteran subsequently passes away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand with Labor in strongly supporting any measures that assist individuals struggling with mental health injuries. As I mentioned, in the electorate of Longman, which I represent, just north of Brisbane, we have an incredibly large veteran population. The electorate also has a very large number of people living with mental health injuries, and I understand from speaking with many of these residents who live in my local area just how difficult day-to-day life can be for these wonderful people. I understand through conversations with them just how heavily financial security can play on their mind. When you're already dealing with problems of your own, the added stress caused by finances is a burden that simply is not needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting that if a member's claim is not accepted the Department of Veterans' Affairs will support the individual with another form of income support to ensure the veteran isn't left without a plan or without any support. It's anticipated that the veteran payment will benefit approximately 1,500 veterans and their partners in the 2017-18 year. So, if by just standing here and supporting this bill my parliamentary colleagues and I can help alleviate just some of the pain of 1,500 returned service men and women and their partners, I wholeheartedly support this measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will move to schedule 3 of this bill, which also deals with mental health support, amending the MRCA and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to create a new pilot program to improve the mental health support that's available in rural and regional areas. Rural and regional areas, which are incredibly important to our country, are where a lot of our veterans have decided to make their home. Building upon the existing Coordinated Veteran's Care Program, which uses a team based model of care led by a GP, the Coordinated Veterans' Care Mental Health Pilot will see the GP access and diagnose clients, undertake care planning and refer clients to use an app on a smart device. This program will target veterans with mild to moderate conditions, such as anxiety or depression, who also have a physical condition that requires some form of pain management. It's expected the program will recruit up to about 125 people each year over the two years. I welcome this. I hope to see a really tangible outcome from this pilot when it reaches Longman in the very near future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to express my support for schedule 5 of this bill. This will be the first legislative instrument to support the implementation of veteran-centric reform. It's designed to help ease the transition process for veterans, of course—who wouldn't support a reform that eases the pathway that veterans will go through after returning from their work and their time in the Defence Force? It seeks to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act as it relates to a claim for a qualifying service, creating an additional way for a determination to be made. It enables the automation of a qualifying service determination primarily based upon the information that's provided by the Department of Defence—in essence, removing a step in what could be a very lengthy process that veterans have to go through to make an application for a benefit or a payment. Of course, this won't alter the right for a veteran to make a manual application themselves at any time; it just smooths that process for them and improves the existing process provided to veterans with another option that should make things easier and should take another stress out of their lives. Who wouldn't welcome and encourage this process?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure I'm no different to other members in the House: my office hears, time and time again, from constituents about how difficult claims can sometimes be and the stress that it causes when they're trying to move through the system to access an entitlement. People who are already vulnerable and people who might be at the end of their tether are applying for Newstart, the age pension or the disability support pension. They've explained to me quite often that the bureaucratic process can be all too much at the time of crisis—it really can be. Even something as simple as smoothing out the process by way of automation, as is sought to be achieved in schedule 5 of this bill, can make a huge difference in someone's life when they are in a very, very vulnerable state. I can totally empathise with anyone who would be concerned about allowing government to bring automation into the claims process for veterans, but allowing the veterans the ability to manually process a claim, as they can now if they choose, provides at least some solace that this will help and not hinder the claims process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will, of course, support anything that makes claims processes easier for our veterans. I have huge communities in places like Bribie Island, and brand-new families are establishing themselves in places like Narangba, so the announcement of $10,000 regarding child care is most welcome. But, along with the rest of Labor, I will take all due care and caution to ensure that all steps are taken by parliament to ensure support for those who have served and those who will serve in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E0F" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I also wish to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-Centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018. I'd like to start by acknowledging the people who are the reason we are debating this issue today: the veterans and their families. Whenever and wherever our veterans serve in the Australian armed forces, they do so in order to protect this country and its people. They've always put their country first. We know that when they've come home, whether it's to the suburbs of Sydney, the outback in Western Australia or my electorate of La Trobe—and we have so many veterans—the support our veterans have needed and benefited from the most has been provided by their families. The veterans are, of course, always supported by their families. We also know that members of veterans' families, whether they are partners, children, parents, siblings or close friends, have made a huge sacrifice while the service men or women are away, because they miss so many occasions, such as birthdays, school events, Christmases and special family celebrations. On behalf of the government, we thank the veterans and their families for what they have done for our country and what they have given up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that, all too often, sacrifices continue in other ways when veterans return, so I commend the government for seeking to implement a number of specific initiatives which are a response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The constant battle: suicide by veterans</span>, which was tabled in parliament last year. I thank the members of that committee. Arising from this report, the government is providing an additional $31 million to support veterans' mental health on top of the $58.6 million that was provided in last year's budget for veterans' mental health. When it comes to veterans, money will never go far enough for what they have done. I also recognise that the opposition members are supporting the government with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the measures that are proposed in this amendment bill, and I'm particularly interested in the inclusions that relate to additional family support for veterans. These are matters—especially the child care—that have been raised with me directly by affected constituents in my electorate of La Trobe. Over the years, I have heard firsthand from veterans about the impact that their combat experience has had on their mental health. I also must say that a number of veterans over the years have had major issues with the DVA in my electorate. My staff always have a door open for our veterans, and we say, 'Let us go and fight these issues for you when you have issues with the DVA, as you have already fought for our country.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm pleased to see that this bill introduces a number of new income support payments for veterans who are unable to work for this reason and who have consequently lodged a compensation claim. When you meet these people, it becomes very apparent that it is very difficult for them, after being in a high-stakes environment where their life can be on the line every day, to come back to mundane work and life in Australia. It is a very difficult transition process. The bill will ensure that, if they are financially vulnerable, they can receive immediate financial assistance while their claims are being assessed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July last year Berwick resident Julie Anderson—I've met with Julie so many times over the years—wrote to me and pointed out a very concerning fact: 'Only five more veterans have to end their lives this year and that will be equal to those killed fighting the enemy in Afghanistan in over 10 years.' Julie makes the sad and relevant point that it's after their efforts, after their service to Australia, when they come back home, that the mental battle really begins within them. Julie has been involved in the social media campaign entitled Not One More, and she referred to a suicide epidemic of our young veterans, which, sadly, is true. She also said 99.9 per cent of our taxpayers want to know that our vets are looked after, but over the past 10 years very little headway has been made to reduce waiting times in suicide prevention despite huge increases in budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I met with the wives of two local veterans, they described the daily challenges of looking after children whilst caring for their badly incapacitated husbands. One of them, whose name is Lyn, said: 'Transitioning out of Defence in any capacity is leaving veterans vulnerable. Medically discharged veterans are often left for months to end with living off $600 per week with no consideration for the size of their family.' So it is heartening to see that the bill will deliver improved family support to veterans who are in receipt of incapacity payments, and that includes greater access to child care—I believe the amount would be up to $10,000 per year—and counselling to enable the family unit to maintain a normal life with connections to community, employment and social interaction that other people are able to take for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, when veterans return to so-called normal life in Australia, it is very hard to adapt, for the family and children especially. For those spouses who pay the highest price of all, with the tragic loss of a veteran through death in recent conflict or through suicide, I believe it is most appropriate that spouses should be eligible for household services and counselling to assist them with adjusting to life after the tragic death of their partner. I believe that the period of two years of service that is offered under this bill is a great start; however, I firmly believe we should not be putting such a relatively brief time limit on trauma and that in fact services should be extended to five years. This is something I've mentioned to my colleagues in the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This view arises from the opinions expressed to me by a number of RSL representatives, in particular Alan Ashmore from La Trobe. I have known Alan to be an amazing ambassador for veterans over the years. He is himself a Vietnam veteran. He has been a tireless campaigner for veterans' rights for nearly 40 years. I think a meeting with Alan was probably one of my first meetings in my office in 2004. Recently, Alan said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Only last weekend I met up by accident with the former wife of one of my best mates whom I was in Vietnam with but suffered badly with PTSD on his return. Mentally and physically he was one of the three toughest men I have ever met but has been a mess since his return from Vietnam. It took him 14 years to get his TPI—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">which is an absolute tragedy. He continued:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It destroyed his marriage and the mental health of his two daughters who still spend periods of time as in-patients in a mental hospital. If it wasn't for their faith and supportive network I doubt if the daughters would still be with us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan finished by saying:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I mention this as I believe close to one million Australians are affected by their war service or as a close family member.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that these changes cannot come soon enough, and therefore I join with my colleagues in commending this bill to the House. With these tragedies, it should have come in so many years earlier.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="263070" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HART</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  Our ADF personnel put their lives on hold in service of our country. They take risks, make sacrifices and commit their lives and wellbeing to the Defence Force. For this reason and many others I'm very pleased that Labor is supporting the bill that we currently have before the House. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018 comprises eight schedules, several of which address recommendations that came out of the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that for some former ADF personnel their service may have a greater impact on them. In these circumstances, we have a duty of care to ensure that both they and their families receive the support that they need to live full and productive lives. Unfortunately, it is a sad fact that former members of the ADF are battling rates of suicide higher than in the general population. A report released last year by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in collaboration with the Department of Veterans' Affairs found, for example, that men who are no longer serving are 14 per cent more likely than the general population to take their own lives. Further, that figure is higher still for young males between the ages of 18 and 24, who are twice as likely to die by suicide as people not in the ADF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Bass is home to the Launceston RSL ADF Welfare Team, the first of its type in Australia, which was set up by Nadia Titley, the Launceston RSL sub-branch secretary. Nadia recognised a gap in services when she saw ADF members becoming homeless and suicidal. The team is run out of the Launceston RSL sub-branch and staffed by accredited volunteers, mostly ex-service men and women with personal experience of military life and an increased understanding of some of the issues that veterans face in their day-to-day lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of the Launceston RSL ADF Welfare Team is to catch veterans before they reach a crisis stage. They do this by providing a friendly ear, assistance and referrals as required, including providing them with essentials like food, housing, clothing, bedding, furniture, toiletries, financial support and health and wellbeing. Indeed, in a recent conversation with Nadia about the work of the Launceston RSL ADF Welfare Team, she emphasised to me that when some of our young veterans leave service they simply don't know how to deal with the day-to-day living activities that we experience. They don't know, for example, how to negotiate a lease for a rental property. They don't know what it's like to go to a supermarket and, for example, use a self-service facility. They're used to the all-encompassing embrace of the ADF, which is a good thing during their service but means that when they leave the service they are exposed to extreme change. Indeed, the veteran community in Launceston and in Northern Tasmania is very well served, and there are several groups and organisations supporting former ADF personnel through their transition back to civilian life and beyond, however difficult that may be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation is Misha's Mates. This is an organisation started by a local Tasmanian veteran, Craig, who served in the ADF for 13 years with five operational deployments throughout Afghanistan and Timor-Leste. Craig knew that many of his colleagues from the ADF and other veterans were struggling with PTSD in the same way he had been, often with very serious consequences. However, the presence of his service dog, Misha, meant that he continued to make positive steps forward, including returning to study at TAFE and later university. Craig drew on his personal experience and started Misha's Mates, which supports veterans to select, test and train their own service dogs through an e-learning portal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must always recognise the tireless work of other local groups in this space, such as the Tasmanian branch of the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia and Launceston Legacy. The care and support provided to our veteran community and their families in northern Tasmania is to be commended, despite the ever-growing demand on these types of services in the face of worsening suicide rates and, of course, an overburdened Department of Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believe that one suicide is one too many, and for this reason we supported the establishment of the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel as a way to explore the issues facing our ex-service men and women. The inquiry took almost a year to complete and received over 400 submissions. These submissions detailed the experience of individuals and interested organisations and suggested ways that we could improve outcomes for our veterans and their families. I note that the executive summary of the report by the Senate inquiry states that it was 'a very large and complex inquiry with terms of reference which could easily have taken multiple reports to cover'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of issues were highlighted throughout the inquiry. These are the same issues that constituents raise with me time and time again in relation to their dealings with DVA, specifically the impact of financial stressors, the adversarial and lengthy claims process and a lack of support for partners of veterans. The report made 24 recommendations, two of which are addressed in this bill by establishing an interim incapacity payment for mental health in particular and increasing support for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In direct response to recommendation 19 of the Senate inquiry, schedule 1 seeks to provide additional support for current and former members and for families of current and former members, including deceased members, by providing additional childcare arrangements, counselling, household services and attendant care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 establishes the veteran payment, which is an interim income support payment for those waiting for their mental health claims to be determined. It seems to me, in the light of what I have outlined with respect to the particular problems faced by the veterans community, extremely unfortunate that, up until this very welcome change, those who are most exposed by their mental illness might be without income and support. Clearly that was a gap that needed to be addressed, and I congratulate the government for addressing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This payment will be available between lodging a claim for mental health injury and the claim being determined, to assist vulnerable persons who may be in financial difficulty. Importantly, the payment will require that a person receiving this payment must participate in vocational and psychosocial rehabilitation. Labor strongly supports measures which provide vulnerable veterans and their families with assistance and support, particularly during difficult times. For individuals struggling with mental health injuries, financial security will play very heavily on their mind. These payments will take some of that burden off the individual and their families whilst they receive the care and support they need to recover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the MRCA, and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the VEA, to create a new pilot program to improve mental health support which is available in rural and regional areas. The Coordinated Veterans' Care Mental Health Pilot will build on the existing Coordinated Veterans' Care Program, which uses a team based model of care led by a GP and is supported by a practice nurse. It will be targeted to veterans with mild to moderate mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression who also have a physical condition requiring pain management. It will recruit up to 125 people each year over two years, with the aim to provide support to veterans in rural and regional areas. Access to support for mental health conditions in rural and regional areas has been an issue of ongoing concern for veterans and their loved ones. Labor is supportive of changes that seek to address some of these concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 will amend the existing provisions relating to compensation for household and attendant care services where an ADF member suffers a catastrophic injury or disease under the MRCA. The new provisions will enable the commission to specify the conditions for the purpose of the definition of catastrophic injury. Currently, this assistance is provided via an exceptional circumstances determination. This change will remove this requirement, thereby minimising any delay in the provision of support. As I said earlier, Labor is supportive of changes which will streamline processes for individuals, particularly in these circumstances, where an individual has suffered a catastrophic injury. We have an obligation to ensure the processes employed in this area are straightforward for these individuals and their loved ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 is the first legislative amendment supporting the implementation of the Veteran Centric Reform and is part of a broader improvement strategy designed to ease the transition process for veterans. This amendment seeks to amend the VEA as it relates to a claim for qualifying service. This amendment will create an additional way for a qualifying determination to be made. Essentially, veterans will no longer have to go through a process which they find most frustrating to prove their service. Rather than qualifying, service determination will be automated and will primarily be based upon information the Department of Defence provides to DVA. As to why this hadn't been implemented earlier, I do not know. Imagine the frustration for somebody in coming to me in my former practice as a lawyer and providing a whole lot of service information and saying, 'Why hasn't Defence provided this to the Department of Veterans' Affairs?' This is a very welcome change. Labor will monitor the reforms to ensure that they deliver the desired outcomes and they don't chip away at veterans entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 makes a number of technical amendments to the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act which will remove redundant references to Comcare and other bodies and repeal provisions not presently related to providing compensation and rehabilitation to current and former ADF members and eligible persons. I understand that these changes will have no impact on the individual. These amendments seek only to remove redundant references given the Defence-specific nature of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act, the DRCA. I'm happy to support any measure that simplifies the complex legislative framework which exists for current and ex-serving defence personnel as long as it doesn't reduce veterans entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 7 makes a number of consequential amendments related to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Act 2017. A number of references are made to 'the council', which will now change to 'the review council' to make it clear that these references relate to the Specialist Medical Review Council, which was introduced by that act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 makes a number of amendments. The first is to the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Test and British Commonwealth Occupation Force (Treatment) Act 2006 to enable a person who is a member of the ADF and served in Japan at any time during 16 August 1945 to the end of 30 January 1946 to be eligible for the gold card. I understand that, in previous legislation before the House last year, there was an error and a person or persons were omitted that needed to be added for eligibility. Given that those individuals were exposed to the same conditions as those who served as part of the British Commonwealth Occupational Force, it is entirely appropriate that they receive the same care and support extended to members of the BCOF, as acknowledged last year. The second change is to the VEA to align the pension age in the VEA with the DRCA and the MRCA. Currently, the pension age as prescribed in the VEA is 65. This will now be changed to state 'pension age', meaning that, as the pension age increases, the act will reflect this and not leave individuals with a gap in support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated earlier, Labor is broadly supportive of the amendments proposed in this legislation, in particular those which address recommendations from the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. Of the 24 recommendations made by the Senate inquiry, the government accepted 22 and two more in principle. I'm very pleased to see action being taken to ensure that these changes are implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you will be aware, Deputy Speaker, the area of veterans' affairs is very much an area where bipartisanship should apply, and it's something we should celebrate where the government makes a positive move. It's very important for members in this place to recognise that we owe a debt of gratitude to ex-service personnel, and that debt of gratitude is not simply repaid by platitudes expressed in this place. We need action, and we need to heed the expert evidence that's presented to Senate inquiries and the feedback that comes from RSLs and ex-personnel representative organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will continue to monitor the implementation of the other recommendations to ensure that they are delivered in a timely manner and that the gaps highlighted through the Senate process are addressed. As I've said previously, our current and ex-serving Defence personnel put their lives on hold in service to our country. They deserve our unwavering support, now and into the future.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  Since my election to parliament, I've had the honour of meeting a great many current and former members of the ADF. In July last year, I travelled, with members opposite, to the Middle East to take part in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. We spent eight days embedded with the men and women of the ADF, and I had the opportunity to speak to them about the challenges that they face and their expectations for their lives after service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also spoken at RSLs all over Fisher, including at the Caloundra RSL AGM. I've met with veterans' groups and encountered many current and former service men and women through my Fisher defence industry initiative. I've even had the privilege of meeting one of my constituents who is a veteran of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span> disaster, the famous Bernie Verwayen, who every law student would be aware of in the matter of estoppel. I have gone out of my way to meet with as many current and former service men and women as I can, because I am passionate about helping to drive change in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister said just a few weeks ago, we best honour the diggers of 1918 by supporting the service men and women, the families and the veterans of 2018. That's why I chose to focus on the treatment of PTSD when I was asked to travel to Sweden, the UK, Canada and the Netherlands by the government last year. During that trip I met with doctors, mental health practitioners, armed forces and government veterans' agencies in those countries to learn about best practice in resolving the mental health problems which can be caused by serving in the military. These included the departments of national defence and veterans' affairs in Canada and the Swedish armed forces department of veterans' affairs. I've sought, since that trip, to bring these lessons to my discussions with our government, and I thank successive ministers for their ongoing engagement with me around some of these ideas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The veterans and the service men and women I have met have been passionate, as I am, about ensuring their ongoing welfare. They, like me, want to see people who have served get the support they need to build successful and fulfilling civilian lives. They want to see more support for dealing with the sometimes, or often, harmful impacts of service on their physical and mental health, and they want to see a Department of Veterans' Affairs that is focused on them and their families and their needs. They don't want to see a combative DVA that fights them on every front from the day that they leave their service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In achieving better outcomes for veterans, the role of community organisations will be vital. There are around 17,000 veterans living on the Sunshine Coast, and our community come together to provide what support we can. In Fisher, we have very active RSL sub-branches at Caloundra; Beerwah and district; Kawana Waters; Glasshouse Country, of which I am the patron; and Maleny. We also have other organisations, such as the Young Veterans Sunshine Coast group and a Diggers Rest that received a Stronger Communities grant just last week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in the end, it is sometimes our sober responsibility as parliamentarians to send Australian service men and women into harm's way. It is also our responsibility to care for them and their families when they return and, unfortunately, in some instances, when they don't. I know that no-one has taken that responsibility more seriously than the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the new Minister for Social Services. The minister's record of delivery for veterans stands as a testament to his commitment and his dedication to looking after our ADF personnel. Two commitments in particular stand out from the then minister's list of achievements: the 2017 budget's provision of $350 million in extra investment for veterans, and the October 2017 government response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report <span style="font-style:italic;">The constant battle: suicide by veterans</span>. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018 is about enacting some of the critical measures involved in those two landmark policies. Under the then minister and under his equally committed successor, the Deputy Prime Minister, the government is already delivering more than $11 billion to veterans and their families every year. There are 291,000 veterans and family members who currently receive government support, and 48 per cent of them are women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the areas that are most important to veterans, the Turnbull government has been particularly active. When it comes to the transition to civilian life, the government laid the foundations for improvement in January 2016 when we reformed regulations such that the Department of Defence can inform the DVA directly when a serving member has become a veteran. This ensures that more veterans can receive much earlier engagement and begin their path to a successful transition to civilian life. In the 2017 budget the government invested $2.7 million for the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program. This money is being used to help businesses understand the unique skills and attitudes ADF members have developed during their service, through supporting the industry advisory committee, through creating an ex-service organisation industry partnership register and through the first annual Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Awards. This program, importantly, also includes the spouses of veterans, who often endure the employment consequences of their partner's service. The government further invested $9.1 million in the 2017 budget for accelerated access to rehabilitation services, streamlined access to incapacity payments and improved access to the totally and permanently incapacitated disability pension for veterans working past the age of 65. In December 2017, Minister Tehan announced almost $1 million allocated to 12 organisations to deliver targeted programs to help the transition process and employment prospects for young veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the minister knows that funding is most effective when partnered with meaningful reform. That is why he announced in the same month that the Turnbull government had ensured that every service man and woman would be guaranteed access to the personal documentation they need to claim support from government agencies in civilian life before they are discharged. This includes an individual transition plan; a record of professional military education and training; unit posting and employment history; final entitlement summaries; and copies of medical and dental records. It's also why Minister Tehan oversaw the passing of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, which helped government departments to speak to each other to ensure that veterans' superannuation benefits assessments can be processed more quickly. It improved the working of the Specialist Medical Review Council, allowed for greater delegation and ensured that the department can respond flexibly to changing circumstances. This was partnered with more investment in the form of an unprecedented additional $166.6 million toward modernising the DVA. This will improve computer systems and it will cut transition processing times dramatically. We have also implemented a trial of alternative dispute resolution for veterans who choose to appeal a decision of the Veterans' Review Board. This is already resolving cases that used to take a year in as little as three months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more to be done, and in this bill are measures to make that transition earlier. In particular, schedule 5 allows the Department of Defence to provide information on qualifying service to the DVA in an automated qualifying-service determination. This will remove an administrative step for veterans to speed up their access to entitlements and reduce unnecessary transition stress. This is only the beginning of the veteran-centric reform package that the government will introduce, but it is an important first stage. When it comes to veterans' mental health, I believe that no government has ever demonstrated greater drive and focus on the issue than this coalition government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Minister Tehan, the 2016 budget made treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, drug and alcohol misuse free for anyone who had served even just one day in the full-time ADF. The 2017 budget went further for veterans, including an extra $33.5 million to extend that coverage to all mental health conditions, without a need to prove that the condition is related to their service and without a cap on funding. All veterans with a mental health condition have access to the Veterans and Veterans' Families Counselling Service, the VVCS. In 2017, once again, the minister and this government secured $8.5 million to extend VVCS to all current partners and children of veterans as well as some former partners. More recently, more than $640,000 is being provided to community groups, supporting veterans under the latest round of the Veteran and Community Grants Program, adding to the $800,000 delivered under round 1. These grants provide support for some of the simple things that can make all the difference to veterans' mental health, like bus trips to reduce social isolation, computer equipment, equipment for Men's Sheds or the refurbishment of RSL facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers on critical additional measures announced by Minister Tehan in the government's response to the Senate inquiry in October which need the support of this House and the other place. The government committed $9.8 million last year to pilot new approaches to suicide prevention and improve care and support available to veterans. These included the Coordinated Veterans' Care Mental Health Pilot, which is the subject of schedule 3 of the bill. This health pilot will incorporate new technologies to provide specialist, light-touch cognitive therapy, critically, in rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2017, Minister Tehan also announced a further $31 million to support veterans' mental health as part of the government's response to the Senate inquiry into veteran suicide. Portions of this investment will go to a new veteran payment, which forms schedule 2 to the bill, for financially vulnerable veterans with a mental health condition. It will also support an annual check for ex-serving ADF members for the first five years after discharge, and a pilot of a new case management service for transitioning veterans among other projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands its responsibilities to our veterans. It has listened to the voices of 300,000 former ADF personnel and their families and is doing all that it can to honour their service and their sacrifice. The government understands that doing right by our veterans will take investment and also knows that it requires fundamental reform. Minister Tehan delivered a great deal for ex-service personnel, and this bill is part of the current minister's vigorous pursuit of the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to join with the remarks of the previous speaker, specifically in relation to the importance of bipartisanship in any issues involving veterans. We, as members of parliament, as I mentioned earlier, have a course, unfortunately, to send our men and women overseas. We have a responsibility to ensure that we look after them when they return, and that responsibility falls on every single one of us in this place. There is perhaps no greater priority for us as parliamentarians than to work together in a bipartisan manner to bring that into effect. I congratulate the shadow minister and those opposite for the bipartisan approach that they take in relation to this portfolio. It's a worthy and honourable thing for them to do in this case. It is unfortunate that we don't get that on all issues, but there is no issue more important than this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The process of investment and reform is ongoing. I know that the government will continue to work with the transition taskforce and others to do more. I look forward to contributing to that important work with the future Minister for Veterans' Affairs when he or she is appointed. In the meantime, this bill is a vital part of our pragmatic consultation-driven changes, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  The government has presented the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018, which is intended to deliver a range of services to veterans and their families. It is a positive move. Even the name indicates a change of attitude and a change of approach. I obviously welcome a veteran-centric approach. The more the focus is on veterans and their families and their needs, the better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister summarised the main points of the bill in his second reading speech when he introduced the bill. I congratulate the current minister on his promotion to Deputy Prime Minister, and I hope that the next veterans' affairs minister has a deep understanding of and is passionately focused on the important work of this portfolio. I wish to recognise the good work of the government, with bipartisan support, in changing the approach of veterans services so as to make those services more appropriate to the needs of veterans, to make them empathetic, more caring and less adversarial. I believe this bill goes some way towards that aim, but there is obviously a lot more work still to be done. The minister pointed out that there are more than 300,000 Australians who have served in our defence forces in peace and war. Each year, more than 5,000 of those will leave the services, and they and their families need and deserve our support as they transition to civilian life and move on to the next stage of their lives. I hope the minister is correct in saying that the measures in this bill will assist our ex-service personnel and also their families. On that basis, Labor supports the bill, and I support the detailed response by the member for Kingston, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, in her speech on second reading debate. I acknowledge the acknowledgement by the previous speaker, the member for Leichhardt, of the shadow minister, because she is doing a fantastic job. She spoke well in her speech on those issues that we have identified in a bipartisan way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses two of the recommendations of the inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel by establishing an interim incapacity payment for mental health and by increasing support for families. Families are absolutely crucial in supporting our current and ex-service personnel, and Labor is committed, if elected, to developing a family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans. As an ex-serviceman myself, I am very conscious of the challenges faced by many of our veterans. I was recently privileged to host a veterans forum in my electorate of Solomon, where I heard firsthand accounts of the concerns of many of the veterans about the difficulties they face in the transition to civilian life. In Solomon there are over 2,000 veterans, and I want to make sure that they have the best possible care and support. The shadow minister for veterans' affairs came up to Darwin for that veterans forum and addressed the gathering. She took note of the issues faced by veterans and their families in the Top End. However, I must point out that, in the same week, the current minister was in Darwin to attend the commemorations of the bombing of Darwin, which was great, but, as well as remembering the fallen, it would have been great if the current minister had held a forum himself, perhaps to hear from veterans firsthand about the challenges that they face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will note some of the main provisions of the bill which I believe are of particular interest to veterans in Solomon, and I'll be making that information available to them now that this bill is before the House. We know that family support is crucial to veterans, and I wish to acknowledge the support often given in difficult circumstances by parents and partners. They are the glue that often keeps veterans and the families together. Even if it's a single member of the forces without their own immediate family, of course their extended family is incredibly important. This is particularly important in the treatment or recovery of ill or injured veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide greater access to child care, additional home care and counselling and will help families maintain connection to community and employment. This is obviously welcome. The bill recognises partners who have to care for a severely incapacitated veteran in addition to their own employment and home duties. They will receive help to develop their skills in caring for a veteran with physical or mental injuries and identifying when people may be at risk of self-harm or causing harm to others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three particular services included in the bill are increased childcare assistance to veterans who receive incapacity payments and have served in recent overseas conflicts and to the partners of veterans who have served in a recent conflict and have died either as a result of the conflict or by suicide; extending intervention counselling for up to five years post discharge for veterans with a rehab plan, their partners and their families; and childcare, home care assistance and counselling for up to five years post discharge for partners and families of veterans who have died either as a result of the conflict or by suicide. I, like all members, am obviously seriously concerned about suicide by our veterans. One is too many, and we've had a lot. I cannot imagine the pain and sense of hopelessness which precedes such an act of terrible finality, and the suffering of partners, family and friends that are left behind. I've spoken with many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke in this parliament about the government's response to the recent Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, I welcomed the report and the government's positive response. I recognised the good work of the members of the committee, particularly then Senator Lambie for initiating the report and the chair, Senator Alex Gallacher, and the deputy chairs, Chris Back and Bridget McKenzie. I thanked all who made submissions to the inquiry. It is because of their strength and their courage in making those submissions that the report was able to provide such a comprehensive picture of the difficulties faced by veterans as they transition into civilian life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate report referred to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report commissioned by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to calculate accurate numbers and rates of suicide deaths amongst serving personnel, reservists and ex-serving ADF personnel. The AIHW found that between 2001 and 2015 there were 325 certified suicide deaths among people with at least one day of service since 2001. Of these deaths, 51 per cent were people no longer serving at the time of their death, 21 per cent were people serving in the active and inactive reserves at the time of their death, and 28 per cent were people serving full-time at the time of their death. Ninety-three per cent were men and seven per cent were women. The AIHW found that the suicide rates of ex-serving men were more than twice as high as for those serving full-time or in the reserve. They were also slightly higher than for their counterparts in the general population after adjusting for age. Ex-serving men aged 18 to 24 were at particular risk, being two times more likely to die from suicide than Australian men of the same age. Ex-serving men aged 25 to 29 accounted for slightly more deaths than other age groups and were 1.4 times more likely to die from suicide than Australian men of the same age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data collection about suicide is difficult in the general population, and in the ex-service community in particular, due to the stigma which continues to surround suicide and the fact that a veteran's suicide may not be reported to DVA—or anyone else, for that matter. These figures may in fact be considerably lower than the real situation. Another point is that recruits to the ADF are fit and healthy, rigorously selected. Any suicide rate amongst ex-service personnel higher than the general population is very significant. So what has caused it? I believe it is significant that the inquiry found that many submitters identified delays, negative determinations or perceived maladministration in the Department of Veterans' Affairs compensation claim processes as creating critical stress for veterans and as a contributing factor to suicide. That is from the report at paragraph 3.43. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another welcome initiative in this bill is a new income support payment, providing vulnerable veterans with interim financial support until their claims for liability for a mental health condition are determined. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to the Senate report acknowledged that many veterans have had negative experiences with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and that there is a need to streamline administrative processes. Streamlining administration is a good thing, and of course I support it, but what I want to see is a department generally committed to serving and supporting our veterans in a sympathetic and supportive way. Even though I still hear anecdotal evidence that this is not the case, I believe that everyone in the department is genuinely doing everything that they can. However, when I held this forum recently at Nightcliff Community Centre in my electorate, I and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs did hear overwhelmingly from the veterans that attended about some of their frustrations in dealing with the department. Some saw that adversarial system. Some spoke of having to prove their case, of feeling demeaned and humiliated and having to get down and beg for help. This is obviously no way to treat those who have served our country. They spoke of having to explain their situation to officers who sometimes had little concept of the stresses and dangers of military service and training, let alone armed conflict, and who are not trained in dealing with emotional and stressed individuals. We need to make sure—and I am sure the department is doing this—that DVA officers, when they are doing their very special and challenging role, have adequate training, mentoring and support to do their job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in different parts of the country veterans are experiencing different levels of support. We heard at the forum that increasingly some gold-card holders were being told by medical practitioners that their books are full and some are being turned away. Clearly this is unacceptable. There is a clear need to improve access for veterans to mental health services and to professionals who have an understanding of particular concerns of ex-service men and women. I add that in my electorate in Darwin and Palmerston and the Top End we need strong veteran advocates to help veterans in their dealings with the department. That is very important. We are currently advertising for such a position, for a level 2 or 3 advocate to come up to Darwin and do that full-time work. I think it is at seek.com.au, for those who are interested. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meaningful employment is very important for the self-esteem of ex-service personnel. Jobs help build social and professional networks and to some extent at least replace support and friendships inherent in service life. Of course they also provide remuneration that we all need for life's necessities. That's why the government's program to get veterans into skilled jobs and the Australian Veterans' Employment Coalition are so important and are doing such good work. I congratulate the companies that are part of that Veterans' Employment Coalition and I look forward to seeing some of the results of their work. Major employers recognise that veterans have leadership and teamwork skills, flexibility and the ability to work in a fast-paced, changing environment. As one employer said, they have dependability, integrity, loyalty and experience, and that makes them especially suited for working in a culturally diverse or global environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Darwin is a very important defence city with a significant serving defence population, and this means that ex-service personnel increasingly choose to stay in Darwin when they retire or leave the services. We welcome them in the Top End, in the northern capital, and we value them. They enrich our community. We must also support them and provide them with the services that they need. They've served our country. They are the heroes of our nation, and we should do everything that we can to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to acknowledge the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia NT. They changed their name recently to Veterans Australia NT. By dropping 'Vietnam' out of their name—a first for Australia—they've sent a very clear message to veterans that they are inclusive. I congratulate them for making that change, and I commend the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I rise to support the government's reforms to the veteran payment system which will lend a hand to ex-service personnel when they return to their community. There are 300,000 people who receive a benefit of some kind from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, including over 3,000 in Wide Bay. It was a coalition election commitment to provide more support to veterans in both employment and the area of mental health treatment. These people put their lives on the line to protect us and our freedoms. It's only fair that we support them and their families as they make the transition back to civilian life, which can be very hard. While all men and women of the ADF are deserving of respect, we particularly remember those who paid the ultimate price. Each year we commemorate lost soldiers on Remembrance Day, promising: lest we forget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should remember that suicide also affects service personnel, taking young lives and destroying families. A study in 2012 found that 54 per cent of all ADF members experience some kind of mental ill health. For many ex-service personnel, the trauma of war remains in their mind and triggers another battle, which for many is too much to bear. Between 2001 and 2015, at least 325 ex-service personnel, tragically, took their own lives—more than three times the total number of casualties in Afghanistan. The true figures are estimated to be higher than this because suicide is only recorded by the DVA when a family makes a claim. One estimate put the veteran suicide toll last year at 84, up from 79 in 2016. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, young ex-service personnel are twice as likely to take their own lives as the average Australian. They are considered high risk because they often return to the community with severe mental trauma and without the skills to secure employment. Worse yet is the difficulty in receiving timely and appropriate compensation for their mental illness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, the Senate began an inquiry into this issue, where they heard from hundreds of veterans and their families and peak organisations. The committee, which included my colleague Minister McKenzie, was met with a deluge of complaints about the DVA and its outdated protocols. Veterans reported that their legitimate claims were being stonewalled by bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the families that voiced their concern was the Bird family from the Gold Coast. In November of 2016, John and Karen Bird said that their son's claim had fallen on the deaf ears of complacent staff. Jesse Bird had developed post-traumatic stress syndrome after he witnessed a close mate of his die instantly from a bomb blast in Afghanistan. When Jesse returned to Australia, he struggled to hold a job due to his anxiety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jesse's claim for compensation was stalled for months and was eventually declined. Jesse's family blamed his continued mental decline in part on the application process. A few weeks after being denied this vital benefit, Jesse, tragically, took his own life. The tragic and avoidable death of Jesse Bird sent shock waves across the country. Then veterans' affairs minister Dan Tehan admitted the department had grievously let Jesse and his family down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The respect we show for the military must not only be found in museums and monuments. The true test is whether we're prepared to give all veterans, especially those requiring urgent assistance, a dignified and fair life. These reforms to DVA will go a long way to achieving this. They are in response to the recommendations of the Senate report <span style="font-style:italic;">The constant battle</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> suicide by veterans</span> as well as advice from the Productivity Commission and the Australian National Audit Office.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans incapacitated due to mental ill health will no longer need to file lengthy paperwork in order to receive compensation, as the process will be automated. Crucially, a new income support payment will be provided for assistance while their claims are processed. This is expected to benefit approximately 830 veterans and their families and partners in the first year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like all good welfare policies, these reforms are designed to help people take control of their lives without encouraging dependency. I'm pleased to say that, in addition to reforms of the payment system, a suite of new services will be available to veterans and their families. The government has committed $31 million to veterans' mental health services on top of the $58.6 million announced in last year's budget. This funding will go towards community-driven initiatives by practitioners and ex-service organisations working together. Families of veterans will also receive more support, including increasing access to child care, counselling and financial advice services. Particularly noteworthy is the commitment to a two-year trial program worth $3.6 million. The Coordinated Veterans' Care Mental Health Pilot will include up to 250 veterans in regional and rural communities. The service will be available for both gold-card and white-card holders, meaning young ex-service personnel can participate. The pilots will be run by a local GP and nurse and use an innovative smartphone app designed by an external expert in mental health. I'll be watching the results of this trial with keen interest. In the past, the need to travel to a city to get specialist treatment has deterred many from seeking help. I thank Minister McKenzie and Assistant Minister Gillespie for their interest in this area and will continue to work closely with them to provide access to mental health services in Wide Bay and across regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that early intervention is the key to preventing suicide. A well-known case in point is the lauded response by the US Air Force in the 1990s to rapidly rising rates of suicide among their personnel. A series of targeted measures for soldiers during and after their service led to a massive 21 per cent decrease in suicides, going from a high of 68 in 1994 to 20 in 1990. The success of the United States Air Force in reducing suicide is something we should strive to achieve in the Australian military. Never again should diggers feel the need to keep their emotions bottled up as so many did when they came home from the Great War.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm constantly inspired by the great work done by community-driven groups like Soldier On and Mates4Mates. I want to see more projects like these in the future reaching out to veterans and transforming their and their families' lives for the better. I fully support the government's welcome reforms to DVA. They have been a long time coming and will allay widespread concerns within the veteran community that the department is not working for them. I will continue to be a strong advocate for veterans as well as all other emergency services workers facing daily trauma. I thank Minister McCormack for his work and implore the government to do everything it can to reduce suicide across the board and eliminate the stigma attached to mental ill health, lest we forget the victims of veteran suicide in the past. Let's work to stop the deaths into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263328" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HUSAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  To be a member of the Australian Defence Force is to dedicate your service and your life to the care and defence of this country. Like everybody in this place, I'm incredibly grateful and thankful for the work that they do. I saw this firsthand on my deployment last year to the Middle East—which I was, by the way, very terrified to visit. I got a firsthand look at the anxiety that runs through you when you are going into a war zone. Our defence personnel have a rich and defining history in helping shape what it is to be an Australian. Mateship, a fair go, courage and sacrifice are all the hallmarks of what you'll find in any of our defence personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As those people return to civilian life, we owe it to them and to their families to ensure that we can offer the best possible service and care. They deserve nothing less than our support on their return. For veterans who have served, there might be fewer deaths in modern warfare now than what we have seen in times past, in World War I or World War II, but there is still a high level of conflict and engagement that happens on the ground there that you don't see in normal life. It is a place like no other. They have stood on our front lines and they've defended our nation, and they've helped other countries to be secure and independent. We owe it to them to provide absolute care and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're supportive of the amendments that are proposed in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018, which address some of the recommendations out of the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. Their wellbeing and obviously the care of their families are paramount. For some, their service and the circumstances that they served in may have a greater impact on them. We have a duty of care to ensure that they receive all of the support that we can offer them to live full and productive lives post service. We believe that one suicide is one too many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently just under 60,000 Australians serving in our defence forces, and the estimated number of living veterans is 316,900—not a huge number compared to the size of this country. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is currently supporting about 221,000 veterans. In my electorate, we have just under 1,000 receiving assistance through the department, and 502 are receiving a disability pension. In addition, there are 306 war widow pensioners. They are not massive numbers. They are not massive numbers of people who deserve our complete and utter respect and support. They are not huge numbers compared to some other groups that we have to look after in this country, but they are very, very important. And I say that they're not a massive group because the level of support they require, if we get it right, will not continue to increase. The level of support that they need will decrease when we do get it right, but we don't get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the discussions that I've had in my community and when I was in Afghanistan last year, they want the support to transition when they get back home. Overarchingly, that was the thing that the serving men and women talked to me most about when I was in Afghanistan. They didn't talk about the day to day; they talked about their families back home, and they talked about how they would reintegrate—that was an anxiety that ran through all of them: how they were going to do that. They talked constantly about how much money is put into getting them battle ready but how very few resources are put into them when they return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are obviously committed to supporting our current and ex-service personnel. Some veterans find it difficult to re-engage with communities, and they're often affected by physical health issues, deterioration of mental health, lack of financial support and difficulties in finding a meaningful job—that is, obviously something that they are qualified to do so but also something that's going to provide them with the stimulation and the engagement to use some of the skills that they have spent part of a lifetime in developing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's difficult to estimate the number of veterans who are homeless. We know that we estimated the number as about 300 people, back three years ago, but it's pretty raw data, as with collecting any homelessness statistics. More needs to be done to understand what that is and how that's driven.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think that the veterans have been through enough, and they have done everything that we have asked of them and then more. We support all veterans, and that's why Labor supported the establishment of the Senate inquiry a few years ago to explore the issues facing ex-service men and women. A number of issues were highlighted through the Senate inquiry, including the impact of financial stress, the adversarial and lengthy claims process and a lack of support for partners of veterans. I've seen firsthand the stressful and difficult work of defence personnel. I studied at university with a Raafie's wife who had four children and saw just how difficult it was for her to move into various communities over their lives. I think they're currently deployed—I lose track—up near Tamworth. Thank goodness for Facebook because it means I'm able to keep up to date with where they are. Taking a family and moving them just a couple of postcodes away is one thing, and it can be quite traumatic for a family to do that. But to be uprooted every couple of years the way defence families are is another thing entirely, and we need to make sure that we are providing that support to those families. It takes a village to raise a child and, if you're constantly uprooting children and partners of serving personnel and re-placing them in other areas, you don't have much time to create much of a village around you. So I'm pleased to see that, in these recommendations and in this legislation, we will do more to support those families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I had the opportunity to spend time with troops in Afghanistan, they all talked about their partners back home. Overarchingly, they want to know that their families will be taken care of but also that their contribution is supported and, more importantly, valued. Some of them said that they feel a bit forgotten in the current battle because most Australians wouldn't know that we've got so many serving in other countries right now. It's our duty to recognise them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate report, <span style="font-style:italic;">The constant battle: suicide by veterans</span>, made 24 recommendations, and the government has accepted 22 and supports two in principle. We're pleased to see the action being taken to ensure these changes are implemented. We've offered our support to the government to ensure the recommendations don't just sit on a shelf. One of the surprising things when I came into this place was seeing how many inquiries have been done, how many lovely, bound books there are prepared by committees and secretariats and how very few of those recommendations are actually acted on. The bill seeks to address two of the Senate inquiry recommendations by establishing an interim incapacity payment for mental health and increasing support for families. We believe that support is absolutely critical and Labor have already agreed that, if we're elected, we will develop a family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans. The strategy would provide a national blueprint to include engagement of DVA and Defence with military families. It would also ensure that the best-practice support for families of serving personnel and ex-ADF members is consistently available across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their selfless sacrifice ensures our personal safety here. When I went to Afghanistan and visited all four bases, I learnt that there is a heightened sense of anxiety amongst personnel about what is going to happen on their return. I don't think that's something that we should take lightly. When they're over there doing their job, we want them to be able to be in the finest mental, physical and emotional state. We don't want them panicked about what's going to happen when they get back. We are well aware of the difficulties that veterans can face when they return home and the scars that they carry from traumatic experience. We know trauma can lead to suicide once veterans have returned home. Sadly, between 2001 and 2015, 325 veterans that we know of took own lives. It is a national tragedy that men and women who have put on that uniform and served our nation upon their return suffer such deep mental and emotional pain that they take their own lives. We need to do more. We need to find ways to support them and stop this from happening. I grew up with an uncle who was on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span> and was left in the ocean for a couple of days. I know the night terrors that he endured, right up until when he passed away, and the fact that he couldn't sleep at night without a TV or a radio going because the darkness and the silence were just too much. That happened to him as a young man in his 20s; he passed away in his late 50s and that followed him right throughout his entire life. We don't want to see that. We don't want people to come back and be scarred or traumatised by things that they see while they're serving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to provide additional support for current and former members by providing additional childcare arrangements, counselling, household services and attendant care. It's in direct response to recommendation 90 of the Senate report, which states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the Department of Veterans' Affairs review the support for partners of veterans to identify further avenues for assistance. This review should include services such as information and advice, counselling, peer support and options for family respite care to support partners of veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of those men and women I met in Afghanistan would be very supportive and welcoming of that. They know their families are doing it tough back here while they are deployed for six months at a time, often with very little family support because, as I mentioned earlier, they are uprooted from community to community with not much opportunity to create that village that goes around you. The proposed amendments will enable the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to provide additional child care, day care and before and after school care, brief intervention counselling, additional household services, home care and counselling assistance. The additional childcare assistance will see families eligible for $10,000 for each child under school age and $5,000 for each primary school aged child. The assistance will help the families who support our veterans, and we absolutely welcome anything that can support these families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 establishes the veteran payment, as the member for Wide Bay pointed out, the interim income support payment for those who are waiting. It is one thing to have a veterans' affairs department, but it is another thing to try to navigate it. I know at my local RSL there are dedicated volunteers whose sole job is to navigate DVA claims. I know of a former lawyer who now provides pro bono services for people who need to get access to DVA. That's an indictment of what's happening at the moment. Anything that can be done to support them in that interim period is incredibly important. The basic rate is $913 per fortnight for an individual, and $713 for a partnered person, subject to satisfying an income and assets test. They would be required to engage in vocational and psychosocial rehabilitation, including financial counselling. Partners of veterans may also be eligible for a payment. In addition to the basic rate, a person may be eligible for a pension supplement, rent assistance, remote area allowance and family tax benefit A. It is anticipated that about 1,500 veterans and partners will benefit from this payment from 2017-18, which raises the question: what did they do before? We know what happened before. These payments will continue while the claim is being determined and for a period of time following the decision to allow a smooth transition to both of those. We support those measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 amends the MRCA and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to create the new Coordinated Veterans' Care Mental Health Pilot program to improve the mental health support available in rural and regional areas. Schedule 4 amends the provisions relating to compensation for household and attendant care services where an ADF member sustains a catastrophic injury or disease under the MRCA. The provisions will allow the commission to approve weekly amounts of compensation for household and attendant care service. It considers reasonable, with individual circumstances being taken into account. Schedule 5 is the first legislative amendment supporting the implementation of veteran-centric reform. This amendment seeks to enable veterans to have an additional way for a qualifying determination to be made. It will remove a step in the process that a veteran must currently undergo, where there is data and a complete service record. We're supportive of these changes that simplify processes for current Defence personnel and veterans, as long as it doesn't reduce their entitlements. We never want to be in a position where we are going backwards in our support for our veterans. We welcome the amendment to give access to the gold card to people who served in Japan at any time from 16 August 1945 to the end of January 1946.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I had the honour, as a patron of the Penrith branch of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia, to attend the 12th anniversary memorial and tribute-laying ceremony. I make mention of patrons Jim Aitken and Ross Sinclair, who I share that privilege and honour with, the president, John Taylor, and the honorary treasurer, Reverend Harry May, who has a finger in about every pie in Lindsay that a volunteer could. He is an amazing man who makes an enormous contribution to my community, especially through the National Servicemen's Association, which plays an incredible role in supporting our national servicemen, veterans and their families. I thank the Nashos for all their work in my community. Organisations like this, and RSL sub-branches, do much to support our veterans and families that need support. Recently I went to the City of Penrith RSL sub-Branch drop-in centre to see the facility they have recently created to help some of those contemporary veterans to access free advice and advocacy referral services and to feel a little more comfortable coming into something they wouldn't be familiar with ordinarily. It's a commendable service for our Lindsay veterans and serving service personnel. I thank Mick McConnell, Brian Cartwright, Gary Scott and Mick Visinko at the City of Penrith RSL sub-Branch for this initiative. Local organisations and services in Lindsay provide critical support, and I thank them all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018. It is our obligation to look after our veterans who have served us well, and our Defence Forces are very much part of what defines this country. Their deeds over 100 years now have been very much part of what it is to be Australian. The debate today is particularly poignant given that 2018 is the year of the Centenary of Armistice—100 years since the guns fell silent at 11.00 am on the 11th day of the 11th month 1918.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most challenging issues facing our current veterans is certainly one that this bill seeks to address—ongoing mental health. Between 2001 and 2015, the Australian Institute of Health and Wellbeing figures state that some 325 veterans took their own lives. One suicide is one too many and, unfortunately, we have seen this number rising in recent years. The government is working on this important issue in a range of ways. In 2015, a mobile app was launched, Operation Life, which was developed to specifically assist those with unique challenges and circumstances that military service can present. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is part of the significant work the government is undertaking to make things better for our veterans and implements a number of specific initiatives announced by the government in October last in response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Constant Battle: Suicide by Veterans</span>. The government has provided an additional $31 million to support veterans' mental health as part of its response to the report, which comes on top of $58.6 million that was provided in the last budget for veterans' mental health. The bill also makes a number of other initiatives including simplifying the determination of qualifying service and extending gold card eligibility to Australian Defence Force members who served in Japan at the end of World War II before the establishment of BCOF and it makes a number of minor technical amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill relates to family support. This measure delivers improved family support to veterans in receipt of incapacity payments and includes key psychological interventions such as greater access to child care and counselling to enable the family unit to maintain its connection to the community, employment and social interaction. Financial advice is also available. Schedule 2 introduces a new income support payment for veterans who have lodged a compensation claim for a mental health condition and are currently incapacitated for work, ensuring that those who are financially vulnerable can receive immediate financial assistance while their compensation claims are being determined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 relates to the CBC mental health pilot, which will include up to 250 veterans with mild to moderate anxiety or depression and physical health problems. The pilot will be embedded in the existing Department of Veterans' Affairs CBC program, which uses a team based model of care led by a general practitioner and supported by a practice nurse. Schedule 4 relates to compensation for household attendant care services where there is catastrophic injury. This measure will provide a range of household and attendant care services for veterans who have a catastrophic injury or disease and aligns how catastrophic injuries are compensated under the equivalent legislation dealing with public servants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 relates to qualifying service and this schedule enables the determination of qualifying service to be automated, removing the requirement for a veteran to make an application for determination. The provisions of schedule 6 are technical in nature and relate solely to the administrative arrangements under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988. Schedule 7 also is basically technical in nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 relates to the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests and British Commonwealth Occupation Force (Treatment) Act 2006, to extend gold card eligibility to Australian Defence Force members who served in Japan as Australian Defence Force members after the cessation of hostilities and before the formation of BCOF. This is very much a further welcome improvement. It's an important piece of legislation that I think provides important additional assistance to address the issue of veterans' mental health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to refer to some of the great work that's done by ex-services organisations in my electorate. They do a great job in ensuring that the memory of the sacrifice and service of our veterans continues. We see our Anzac Day services growing larger and larger every year. I think it is in no small part due to the huge effort by our local ex-services organisations, who do such a great job not only in looking after the interests of veterans but also in ensuring that the memory of the service of veterans is maintained. I'd like to single out two particular ex-servicemen in my contribution today. One is Greg Laird, from RSL Port Macquarie Sub Branch, and the other is Bob Denner, from Dorrigo RSL sub-branch. Both were awarded OAMs in this year's honours list; a very fine tribute to two great men who make a huge contribution to their communities. I think that they were united in saying that they were accepting their awards on the basis of the broader contribution by the ex-services community more generally. I have a range of sub-branches across my electorate: Kempsey Macleay, South West Rocks, Macksville, Taylors Arm, Urunga, Coffs Harbour and Nambucca Heads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 18 February I was honoured to be able to attend the National Servicemen's Association Nambucca Valley branch commemoration of National Servicemen's Day at Nambucca Heads, a great service that that branch puts on every year to recognise the particular contribution of our national servicemen, who went where they were asked when they were asked. On the next day, 19 February, I had the opportunity to take Senator Molan on one of his first visits to a regional electorate as an elected senator in this parliament. We got to inspect the military museum at Bowraville, a fantastic local facility run by volunteers. I'd like to commend Blue Manning, Jim Cameron and their great band of volunteers, who do such a great job in the running and the improvement of the Bowraville military museum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great little military museum. It has a range of exhibits and a very strong focus on the Vietnam War period, given that most of the volunteers involved are, in fact, Vietnam vets. They have a vast range of equipment and memorabilia on show and a fantastic collection of early model military vehicles, from Bren gun carriers to Bofors guns and various blitz trucks to various jeeps, lovingly restored by the volunteers. Jim Cameron in particular is an incredible craftsman and has an incredible ability to do very impressive restorations on vehicles and military equipment. I commend this legislation to the House, but I more greatly commend the huge amount of work that is done by our ex-services organisations to support our veterans and to ensure that the sacrifices of our service personnel are never forgotten.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I rise to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018 and give my wholehearted support for the bill's extension of additional support services for veterans and their families and the establishment of the interim income support veteran payment. I'd like to give particular mention to schedule 8 of the bill. At the time of passage of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017 I was unable to speak, and therefore would welcome the opportunity to set down some of my words of support on the parliamentary record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Senator Xenophon has long campaigned for the civilian and veteran victims of the Maralinga, Montebello and Emu Field nuclear tests, as well as for those veterans who served in the post-World War II occupation forces in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Schedule 8 of the bill extends the provisions which provide a Department of Veterans' Affairs gold card to those victims, obtained in negotiations with the government as a direct result of the tireless advocacy of former senators Xenophon and Skye Kakoschke-Moore, who was a tremendous supporter of defence personnel and veterans. Both of them were from the Nick Xenophon Team. These veterans and civilians have long suffered and have had very long struggles to convince the Department of Veterans' Affairs that their claims for redress and medical support were of merit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally the burden of proof has been reversed for these veterans, who have struggled for so long against this in order to pay their medical bills. These changes are long overdue. Of the approximately 17,000 people affected by the British nuclear tests in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s, approximately 1,100 survivors remain. Mr Yami Lester, a South Australian Aboriginal man, an elder, was blinded by the atomic fallout from a test site. That was reported on National Indigenous Television, or NITV. He said this has come 60 years too late:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most of our people have passed away. They were young ones then, now they're older ones now, a few of them still living now today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Mr Lester died before the original Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill was passed. This is not ungratefulness; this is reality. I believe that successive Australian governments have utterly failed these victims of exposure to nuclear radiation. We cannot right this wrong. However, we can publicly recognise that the wrong took place, we can acknowledge Australia's collective failure and we can do what we can to provide meaningful relief to those who are still alive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one additional matter that I would like to raise with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the government. I have Australian citizens in my electorate who have been Australian citizens for many decades and who served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. However, they were Commonwealth citizens at the time of their service—for example, they were British citizens. I would urge the minister to carefully consider extending the operation of this bill to those few, those very few, allied soldiers who served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and now call Australia home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to personally thank former senator Nick Xenophon for not giving up the fight for the much-deserving civilians and veterans who were exposed to nuclear radiation. A Department of Veterans' Affairs gold card makes a lasting and meaningful difference to those remaining survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to say a few wonderful words about my RSLs. My RSLs don't have pokies. They are safe, welcoming places for veterans and their families, and they have warmly welcomed me into their places. They never forget the birthday of a member and they never forget a member that they've lost. They are community venues, places of mateship and places of warmth and friendship. They have local museums and they host many events in my community commemorating many fields of war and of course Remembrance Day and Anzac Day. Most importantly, beyond all of the event work that they do and the mateship that they have between themselves, they are connecting with the next generation and making sure that our schoolchildren are aware of the sacrifices of the generations that have gone before them. So I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to the RSLs in my community. You do a wonderful job, and it is my great privilege to support you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  It is my great pleasure to rise in the House today to speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018. I'd like to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Michael McCormack, as well as his predecessor, Dan Tehan, for the tremendous work they've done to ensure that our government is providing the support and the services our veterans and their families deserve. This bill contains eight schedules which will introduce several new initiatives to deliver a range of services for the veterans' community and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Forde, I'm very proud to support our local veterans, and veterans' support services, because they have done so much to protect our country. It is important that we as a government, and, I think, in fairness, all of us in this chamber, recognise and support and attempt to do our best to protect our veterans and look after their best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great local services in my community is the Beenleigh RSL sub-branch, which runs a range of fantastic veterans' support programs and services. I always enjoy dropping in to the Beenleigh RSL's fortnightly Diggers Day to share a beer and have a few laughs with the members. But you never walk away from Diggers Day without understanding what they truly think about a range of issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud to support the neighbouring RSL sub-branch of Greenbank, as well as the North Gold Coast RSL sub-branch in Upper Coomera. Every year we see our local service clubs go above and beyond to mark important anniversaries in our nation's history—the anniversaries of battles that have won our freedom; battles, sadly, of tragic loss; and battles that have forged the mateship and camaraderie that define Australia. Their commemorative services are a constant reminder of the service and sacrifice of our men and women, past and present, in peacetime and in conflict, in Australia and abroad. These services keep the spirit of national pride at the forefront of our minds and seek to teach our future generations the importance of remembrance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RSLs around Australia play such an important role in providing a voice at state and national levels for the service and ex-service community. They maintain the lasting ties of mateship that perpetuate the spirit of Anzac, and their community spirit spreads so much further than the commemorative services; they also provide much-needed support to those who have served the nation and their families. When a current or ex-service person is sick or down on their luck, our local RSL sub-branches are there to help. Their arms of support stretch out to provide help with pensions, welfare, medical attention, finding accommodation or housing and even suitable employment. Our RSLs provide a strong voice for those who have served our nation so bravely, many of whom, sadly, made the ultimate sacrifice. They advocate for a strong Defence Force to protect our country and encourage the best possible conditions for current Defence Force personnel and ex-service members. The team at the Beenleigh RSL sub-branch are very proactive and always looking for ways they can best utilise what the federal government has to offer in grants to improve the range of services and facilities they can provide to the ex-service community and those members still serving today. I have enormous respect for the work they do, and I'm pleased that with the schedules in this bill we can continue to build on the support that has been provided to veterans over many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The eight schedules and the new initiatives in this bill before the House will help more than 300,000 Australians who have served in Australia's defence forces. Every year more than 5,000 members of our defence forces leave service. How we help these men and women and their families reintegrate into general society is a vital component of our commitment to supporting our veterans. Schedule 1 of this bill will introduce a range of measures aimed specifically at providing family support to veterans and their families. Families, as we in this place know well, provide an important role in supporting current and ex-serving Defence Force members. In particular they make an enormous and significant contribution to their health and wellbeing. To build on the existing support an additional $7.1 million over four years will help extend the support available to families of veterans. This includes greater access to child care, home care and counselling, and will also help families maintain connections to the community and employment. While our veterans give so much to our country, the families who stand behind them sacrifice so much to help them. It is only right for this government to do all it can to support those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 will create a new veteran income support payment to provide vulnerable veterans with interim financial support until their claims for liability for mental health conditions are determined. The veteran payment will support around 830 veterans and 690 partners into the 2018-19 financial year. Schedule 3 of the bill will enable selected white card holders to participate in a new Coordinated Veterans' Care Mental Health Pilot, a program for veterans with mild to moderate anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or comorbid physical health problems. This pilot program was allocated $3.6 million in the 2017-18 budget. Schedule 4 will make amendments to ensure veterans with catastrophic injury or disease receive at least the same entitlements as civilian employees. Schedule 5 will enable the automation of a qualifying service determination prior to or at the time a veteran engages with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, or before the veteran makes an application for any service pension. This measure removes a step in the process a veteran currently needs to undertake in order to make an application for a service pension. Schedule 6 makes some minor technical amendments to ensure that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 is a military specific act. Schedules 7 and 8 also relate to a number of technical and minor amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, the Turnbull coalition government made a commitment to ensure that current and future veterans and their families had the support they needed. I believe this bill provides some important changes that will better support veterans and their families. I'm proud to support these measures and help the coalition government deliver these important initiatives. These measures assist not only those who have served our nation but also their husbands, their wives, their partners, their fathers, their mothers and, importantly, their children. Each set of amendments seeks to mean better outcomes for veterans across Australia. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018. Our ADF personnel put their lives on hold in service of our nation. They take risks, they make sacrifices and they commit their lives and wellbeing to the protection of this country, to the protection of our way of life, to the protection of our nation's security and to the protection of our wellbeing. Upon return, the scars these men and women wear are not always visible. In these circumstances, we as a nation have a duty of care to both our returned service personnel and their families—and I want to underscore that. This is as much about the veterans as it is about their families. I know of my late father-in-law's experience and my late mother-in-law's experience. My late father-in-law was a Vietnam vet and my late mother-in-law always said that she got a different man back from the war. So this is as much about the families, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, as it is about the veterans, and, as you know, it's not just the partner or the spouse of the serving member; it's also the children. We hear of those stories of intergenerational PTSD as a result of the trauma—the post-traumatic stress that has emanated from conflict and from serving in really difficult circumstances, including disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. It potentially has a significant knock-on effect down the generations. So it is our duty as a nation to care for those returned service personnel and their families and children to ensure that they receive the support they need to live full and productive lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel was so important. It allowed us to explore the issues facing our ex-service men and women and identify ways we can improve outcomes for our veterans and their families. The report made 24 recommendations and the bill addresses two of those recommendations. It establishes an interim incapacity payment for mental health and increasing support for families. Support for veterans' families has been an issue that Labor has been pursuing, particularly the member for Kingston, who is the shadow minister. She's been an active advocate on this issue. She has pursued this issue relentlessly, particularly through the Family Engagement and Support Strategy for Defence Personnel and Veterans. I am delighted that Labor has committed to developing this strategy if elected. The bill is comprehensive in its amendments, with eight different schedules covering a variety of areas, including family support, as I mentioned, veteran payments, compensation for catastrophic injury, a coordinated veteran care mental health pilot, qualifying service and the Specialist Medical Review Council—a range of areas are covered by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go into a number of those schedules. The previous speaker went into all eight and I do want to cover them off for the purposes of the record. Schedule 1, as he mentioned, seeks to provide additional support for current and former members and the families of current and former members, including deceased members, by providing additional childcare arrangements, counselling, household services and attendant care. This schedule is in direct response to recommendation 19 of the Senate inquiry, which called for a review of the support available to partners of veterans to identify avenues of assistance. As I mentioned, it is not just the veterans who experience trauma and feel the effects of conflict sometimes many years after the actual event; it's also the families that bear the brunt of that, which is why it's so important that as much support is provided for them as is for the veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 establishes the veteran payment, which is an interim income support payment for those waiting for their mental health claims to be determined. These payments are subject to satisfying an assets and income test and require individuals to engage in vocational and psychosocial rehabilitation including financial counselling. Partners of veterans may also be eligible for a payment. This new payment is also in response to the Senate inquiry and the outcomes of the inquiry into the tragic suicide of Jesse Bird.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 amends the MRCA and the Veteran Entitlement Act to create a new pilot program to improve mental health support available in rural and regional areas. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, coming from a regional area, a number of our defence bases are in regional and rural areas like your own and that of the member for Herbert, who is here speaking on this bill. There is a number of regional areas that house huge populations of the Australian Defence Force and proudly do that, with the ADF knowing very much that they have a social contract with these communities and that there is a mutual respect between both the ADF and the host community, so to speak. There's a number of Defence bases in regional areas, so it's vitally important that we provide those mental health support services in those regional and rural areas where sometimes finding the expertise, the staff and the skills can be challenging. I know that the member for Herbert, who is a professional in this space and has been an active advocate of mental health for decades, will be discussing this issue in more detail in her contribution. And I commend and thank the member for Herbert for her contribution to the mental health of her community for, as I said, not just a few years but decades across a broad range of areas. I look forward to hearing the member's discussion on that later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 will amend the existing provisions in relation to compensation for household and attendant care services where an ADF member sustains a catastrophic injury or disease under the MRCA. The new provisions will enable the commission to specify the conditions for the purposes of the definition of 'catastrophic injury'. The provisions will allow the commission to approve weekly amounts of compensation for household and attendant care services—so vital in support for those who are doing it tough—and those services will be provided in circumstances that are considered reasonable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 is the first legislative amendment supporting the implementation of veteran-centric reform and is part of the broader improvement strategy designed to ease the transition process for veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 makes a number of technical amendments to the DRCA which will remove redundant references to Comcare and other bodies and repeal provisions not related to providing compensation and rehabilitation to current and former ADF members and eligible persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 7 makes a number of consequential amendments related to the veterans' affairs omnibus act of last year. A number of references are made to 'the council', which will now change to a uniform reference of 'the review council'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 makes a number of amendments and the first to the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests and British Commonwealth Occupation Force (Treatment) Act 2006. It will enable a person who was a member of the ADF and who served in Japan at any time from 16 August 1945 to the end of 30 January 1946 to be eligible for the gold card. This amendment is intended to extend the gold card eligibility to those members of the ADF who served in Japan just prior to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and subsequently missed out on the changes that came about last year. The second change aligns the pension age in the VEA with the DRCA and MRCA. That's it for the schedules. I thought there was one more!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That gives you a very brief overview of the detail that is in this bill that provides support to veterans and their families across a broad range of areas and addresses a number of glitches that weren't anticipated in reforms of the past. But specifically, in closing, I just want to spend some time talking about a fantastic veterans program in my own community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone is familiar with Soldier On and the great work that they do. They had a launch just this week, at Parliament House, of their latest program of employing their veterans in a range of programs across Australia. But there's a very special program that's very quietly operating in my electorate, up at Tharwa. I visited there just recently to go and talk to the owner of this program about the great work that he's doing in providing some sort of therapy and healing for veterans, as well as easing the transition for those veterans who are leaving the ADF and going into civilian life. As you know from your experience, Deputy Speaker Buchholz, and from the experience of those members here, it can be quite traumatic leaving that sense of mission that people have from wearing a uniform and serving their nation through the ADF to go into a civilian life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to Karim and Mark at the Tharwa Valley Forge. Through Karim and Mark's efforts, they've developed a wonderful knife-making program—beautiful knives, Deputy Speaker Buchholz; I'd love to take you out there. The knife-making program has been developed for veterans and retiring defence personnel. Mark and Karim developed a series of courses for veterans and their families that will assist them to reintegrate and reconnect following their military service. Fortunately, they managed to secure a grant of $58,000 under the Veterans and Community Grants program. Through that, they're now providing 64 veterans with 16 courses, and that will give them this wonderful opportunity to engage in making knives through this forge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tharwa Valley Forge is not just a forge. They've got the knife-making program where they're focusing on veterans and easing that transition for veterans and helping in the healing, but they've also got blacksmithing. They've got a blacksmithing operation out the back of the forge. And Karim and Mark and his partners have got big plans for a range of programs for veterans in the future. What is so terrific about the forge is the fact that they use a model based on sustainable altruism. It's already been providing real benefits to veterans, and it will do so in the future. It was just terrific to visit and see these beautiful knives and the work that's being done but also to talk to the veterans and see the impact that it has on them. There were a number of veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One veteran was there with his girlfriend because he wanted to do something in partnership with her. He wanted to have a hobby, a craft, in partnership with her. Through serving, he was constantly leaving her behind, and in going through rehabilitation and healing and transitioning he was constantly leaving her behind. He doesn't want to leave her behind anymore. He wants her to be part of this journey through this healing, through this wellbeing, through this transition, so he was there with his girlfriend. He said to me: 'Look, there are all these terrific programs that Soldier On runs. There are all these other terrific programs where other outfits—Mates4Mates and a range of other really great organisations—are doing great work. But there's a lot of yoga; it's a lot of art therapy—it's a lot of activities that I traditionally wouldn't be interested in.' What he loves about the forge and the work that Karim and Mark are doing is that he gets to make knives and to create beautiful things out of metal through blacksmithing. Over the course of the three days of the course, the participants start by forging their own steel. They shape and sharpen their own blades, they make the handles out of wood and handcraft the wood, and then they piece it all together, the end product being a beautiful, magnificent piece of art.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I will talk about Mark. He took a circuitous to knife-making. He enlisted in the army at 17, served for 13 years and saw active service in East Timor and Iraq. As a result of his service, he was medically discharged in 2009 and faced a difficult road to recovery. Fortunately, thanks to the work that he's doing with the knife-making and forging—which he gained an interest in through a gift voucher from his wife—he's now actively engaged in creating this amazing transition for veterans: healing them, helping with their transition and really delivering great benefit. I commend the work of the Tharwa Valley Forge.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018. In doing so, I would like to share some words from Cassandra, a veteran of the Royal Australian Navy and a constituent of my electorate of Dobell, who has written to me a number of times deeply concerned about the wellbeing of veterans and, in particular, the rising rate of suicide. In November last year she wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I woke this morning to hear the number of Veteran suicides so far for 2017 has risen to 73. Every time this number rises I feel immense sadness but this one more so as I have now learnt his name. I lived next door to him, his beautiful wife and two wonderful children. He was discharged some years ago but has forever struggled with … PTSD and yesterday he made the ultimate decision to end his life. Many will not know the years of impact on not only this person but his family behind closed doors, it was more than any can imagine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veteran suicides are a national tragedy. Labor is committed to supporting our current and ex-service personnel and their families. Labor supported the establishment of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel as a way to thoroughly develop responses to the issues facing our ex-service men and women. The inquiry took almost a year to complete and received over 400 submissions detailing the experiences of individuals and interested organisations and suggesting ways we can improve the lives of our veterans and their families. I want to take the opportunity to thank those people who shared their deeply personal experiences as part of this process. A number of issues were highlighted by the inquiry, including the impact of financial stress, the adversarial and lengthy claim process and a lack of support for partners of veterans. The Senate inquiry made 24 recommendations, of which the government accepted 22 and two in principle. Labor offered our support to the government to ensure these recommendations were implemented quickly and effectively. This bill contains a number of measures, several of which address recommendations that came out of the Senate inquiry. We were pleased to see action being taken to make this change. We will continue to apply pressure to the government to keep these changes on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to address two of the recommendations of the inquiry by establishing an interim incapacity payment for mental health and by increasing support for families. Greater support for families is an issue which Labor is actively pursuing. It is important to support those supporting our current and ex-defence personnel. It is for this reason that we committed, if elected, to developing a family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans. This strategy would provide a national blueprint to engage DVA and Defence with military families. It would also make support for families of serving personnel and ex-ADF members consistently available across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have often spoken with Bob Ihlein, who is from The Entrance Mens Shed and is a member of Overwatch, a veterans suicide prevention group and a strong advocate for veterans mental health and suicide prevention. Bob let me know recently that Overwatch has saved at least 15 lives because of its interventions. Bob has said that providing child care, counselling and household help for veterans and their families is important in helping them deal with their problems and with DVA itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill seeks to provide additional support for current and former members and the families of current and former members, including deceased members, by providing additional childcare arrangements, counselling, household services and attendant care. This is in direct response to recommendation 19 of the Senate inquiry, which called for a review of the support available to partners of veterans to identify avenues of assistance. Labor welcomes this additional funding and support for those who support our current and ex-serving defence personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 establishes the veteran payment, an interim income support payment for those waiting for their mental health claims to be determined. These payments are subject to satisfying an asset and income test and require individuals to take part in vocational and psychosocial rehabilitation, including financial counselling. Partners of veterans may also be eligible for a payment. This new payment is in response to the Senate inquiry and the outcomes of the inquiry into the suicide of Jesse Bird. The veteran payment will be a form of interim income support payment available between lodging a claim for a mental health injury and the claim being determined, to assist vulnerable people who may be in financial difficulty. Where a veteran and their partner are receiving the payment and the veteran dies, payment will continue to the partner. These payments will continue while the claim is being determined and for a period of time following the decision to allow for a smoother transition for the veteran and their family. Importantly, if the member's claim is not accepted, DVA will support the individual across to another form of income support so the veteran is not left without a plan or support. Labor supports this measure as financial security is crucial to those whose service has impacted them and their family. It is our responsibility to support them. I mentioned earlier Bob from the Entrance Men's Shed and from Overwatch. He understands how important the interim payment is for veterans waiting for their claim to be dealt with. This is what he said to me about this interim support:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Veterans need income while their claims are being dealt with; the cost of living is still the same and you need some sort of income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It just makes sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of this bill creates a new pilot program to improve mental health support available in rural and regional areas. Before coming to this House I was a mental health worker for 10 years at Wyong Hospital, near where I grew up. I've seen firsthand the difference it can make to have timely access to psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and other people involved in supportive services. The Coordinated Veterans' Care Mental Health Pilot will build on the existing Coordinated Veterans' Care program, which uses a team based model of care, which is vital, led by a general practitioner supported by a practice nurse. This pilot will allow the GP to assess, diagnose, undertake care planning and refer clients to use an application on a smart device. It will be targeted to those veterans with mild to moderate mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, who also have a physical condition requiring pain management. It will recruit up to 125 people each year over two years, with the aim to provide support to veterans in rural and regional areas. I earlier mentioned my experience as a mental health worker. In particular, dealing with pain as a comorbidity with mental health conditions is extremely complex and requires coordinated care by multidisciplinary teams, so I strongly support this measure. Access to support for mental health conditions in rural and regional areas is an issue of ongoing concern for veterans and those who care for them. Labor supports changes which address some of these concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 will amend the existing provisions relating to compensation for household and attendant care services where an ADF member sustains a catastrophic injury or disease under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The new provisions will enable the commission to specify the conditions for the purposes of the definition of a catastrophic injury. The provisions will also allow the commission to approve weekly compensation for household and attendant care services it considers reasonable in individual circumstances. Currently this assistance is provided via an exceptional determination. This change will remove this requirement, reducing delays in providing support. This amendment will also ensure that entitlements made under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act for household and attendant care services are equivalent to members covered under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act and civilians covered under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The amount payable will be determined by the commission according to the individual's circumstances. In addition, for those who have already gained assistance through a special determination, their current level of assistance or benefit will be preserved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports changes which streamline processes for individuals, particularly in circumstances where an individual has suffered a catastrophic injury. We have an obligation to make the process straightforward for these individuals and for their loved ones. As Bob has said to me often, one of the problems for veterans is the paperwork involved and the time taken for them to get help. As Bob said to me, 'When you are suicidal, the last thing you want to think about is paperwork.' It's not something that someone should have to deal with. The system should be streamlined and straightforward and should be there to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 is the first legislative amendment supporting the implementation of veteran centred reform and is part of the broader improvement strategy designed to ease the transition process for veterans. This amendment will create an additional way for a qualifying determination to be made. The amendment will enable the automation of a qualifying service determination and will primarily be based on information from the Department of Defence to DVA. Essentially, this amendment will remove a step in the process a veteran must currently take in order to make an application for some benefit or payment. Again, Labor supports changes which improve processes and support for veterans and their families. That said, Labor will be monitoring these reforms closely to ensure they work as intended and don't chip away at veterans' entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 makes a number of technical amendments and enables the commission to provide information to the Chief of the Defence Force for the reconsideration or review of a determination made regarding the liability of injury, disease or death of an employee. This amendment will align the information-sharing provisions under the DRCA and the MRCA. The amendments in this section will also reinsert section 43 into the SRCA which was omitted during the drafting process. This will ensure that a peacekeeper does not experience any disadvantage. This does not reflect a policy change to any entitlement and/or benefit a peacekeeper may receive under the SRCA. The creation of DRCA in 2017 caused some angst in the veterans community. Labor worked diligently with members of the veterans community to follow up each concern in order to make sure that this legislation works as intended. Again, Labor supports changes which simplify the complex legislative framework which exists for current and ex-serving Defence personnel as long as it doesn't reduce veterans' entitlements. We are assured by the government that these changes have no impact on entitlements and, instead, only remove redundant provisions, add information-sharing and ensure peacekeepers are not disadvantaged by the creation of the DRCA. It is because of these assurances that we support this provision.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the amendments proposed in this legislation—in particular, those which address recommendations from the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. Labor will continue to monitor the implementation of the other recommendations to ensure they are delivered in a timely manner and that the gaps highlighted through the Senate process are addressed. Our ADF personnel take risks, make sacrifices and commit their lives to the Defence Force to serve our country. I thank the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the opportunity to meet with him and to discuss veteran suicides and raise the concerns of Cassandra, Bob and many others in my community who are doing what they can to draw attention to this national tragedy and are working locally in our community to try to improve the lives of veterans and those who care for them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm looking forward to hosting in my electorate a safeTALK workshop organised by the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to help raise awareness and understanding about the risk of suicide amongst veterans and help people involved in their care, including RSL sub-branches and welfare officers, by providing the tools that they need to be able to have safe conversations about suicide and suicide ideation. This is something that is really close to my heart. As someone who has worked in mental health and has seen the consequences for individuals and their families, I'm really pleased to speak in support of this bill. I'm looking forward to swift implementation so that no people are left behind or worse off. I support the government in what they're doing and support the recommendation of the Senate inquiry. This is something that really matters and it's something that we can and must do something about.</span>

                    <a href="249908" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I am also pleased to stand here and speak in support of the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Bill 2018. I am honoured to represent the largest garrison city in this great nation. The electorate of Herbert is home to the largest community of veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. I can call Australia a great nation thanks to the men and women who have served to protect our freedoms. Our Defence Force personnel have put their lives on the line so that we can have a great quality of life in this country. Our Defence personnel have made huge sacrifices: time away from their families, risking their own safety, lives, mental health and wellbeing. No amount of money or thanks we give to our veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families could repay the debt as they richly deserve, but as their elected representative I can fight for their rights and wellbeing every day in this place to ensure that they have access to the health care, training and job opportunities they require, that their families are supported well and that they have a strong voice in this place on all matters related to veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am passionate about veterans' affairs and have brought my mental health expertise into my role as the member for Herbert. Before being elected to this place I worked for 15 years in the role of CEO of two mental health community managed organisations in both the mental health specialist employment area and the community and social inclusion sector. People's lives are complex, especially when living with mental illness. Without a doubt this government needs to do much better in general, but particularly so in relation to veterans, and this bill will go some way towards that. Quality mental health services require highly trained people—that is, support workers and professionals who are able to build relationships based on trust and dignity. Contemporary mental health supports are directed by the person seeking the support, which may also include their family members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly the case for veterans and ex-serving personnel. This approach to service delivery also creates training and job opportunities for veterans in the form of peer workers. Veterans and ex-service personnel struggling with poor mental health and PTSD will relate much better to workers with lived experience of defence life. That is why the suicide prevention trial, known in our community as Operation Compass, is doing so well. The project manager is a retired army colonel who has experienced a number of overseas deployments and has lived experience of defence life. Operation Compass has been supported by the Townsville Defence Community Reference Group that I established in 2016 in order to work with stakeholder groups and Defence personnel. I particularly acknowledge the outstanding contributions to this project from retired Lieutenant General John Caligari, personnel from Lavarack Barracks and RAAF Base Townsville, the Northern Queensland PHN, VOTSA—Veterans Off The Streets—the RSL and many local ESOs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Operation Compass has also led to the establishment of The Oasis, a veterans' hub that will be a one-stop shop for transitioning service personnel and those who have transitioned and are in need of assistance, including mental health support. The Oasis is also supported by the Townsville Defence Community Reference Group. I understand our veterans and ex-serving personnel and families deserve quality, timely and appropriate supports. My meetings with veterans and veterans' organisations over the last year has led me to understand that we lost 86 veterans to suicide in that 12-month period. One life lost is simply one too many. This figure shows the government needs to do better by our veterans. As I said, this bill goes some way towards starting that help today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to stand with Labor in support of this bill. This bill seeks to address two recommendations from the Senate inquiry by establishing an interim incapacity payment for mental health and increasing support for families. Where there are issues with someone's mental health, there are always issues for the family. All too often families get left out of the conversation about mental health support options. Families must be included, as they are the ones who bear the brunt of the impact and are there day in, day out, giving the support needed. Families provide the immediate and necessary support, and if we are to do better by veterans, we need to do better by their families when it comes to mental health support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greater support for families has been a focus for Labor in policy development, and this is essential, because often it also impacts on children. It is for this reason that a Shorten led Labor government has committed to developing a family engagement and support strategy for Defence personnel and veterans. This strategy will provide a national blueprint to include the engagement of DVA and Defence with military families. It would also ensure that best-practice support for families of serving personnel and ex-ADF members was consistently available across the country. The government has begun to implement these recommendations, but we cannot take our foot off the pedal when it comes to ensuring support for families, and Labor will ensure that this momentum continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 seeks to provides additional support for current and former members and their families, including families of deceased members, by providing additional childcare arrangements, counselling, household services and attendant care. These are very necessary and vital supports. From child care to counselling to household services, these measures are vital. The additional childcare assistance will see families eligible for up to $10,000 per child per annum, under school age, and/or $5,000 per child per annum for primary school children, and cover child day care and before- and after-school care expenses. Brief intervention counselling will also be extended to current and former members with a current rehabilitation plan within five years post discharge. Their families will also be entitled to access up to a total of 20 sessions over the five-year period. The counselling provided will be in addition to any treatment provided under the DVA healthcare system. Additional household services, home care and counselling will enable widows and widowers of an ex-ADF member to receive financial assistance for a range of services—for example, garden maintenance, home and domestic support—to assist them to adjust to life after the death of their partner. This increased assistance is intended to include a current or former member who has a post 1 July 2004 warlike service and has a current rehabilitation in place, and the partner, children, parents and siblings of deceased members who rendered warlike service and who may have committed suicide due to their service. This is intended to recognise the unique needs of these members and their families and provide an appropriate level of assistance to assist their health and employment outcomes and provide needed support for the family who support the member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When a person's mental health is affected, they should not have to jump through hoops just to get help. Everyone should be able to reach out for help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of measures in this bill that I proudly support, but, most importantly, it is the interim income support. In the last sitting of parliament, I met with Karen Bird, Jesse Bird's mother. She is an amazing woman, and, despite everything Karen, her husband and family have gone through—all of the negativity and the life-changing events—Karen has been able to turn her heartache into action, and I found her an incredibly positive and inspiring woman. Karen and her husband are passionate that their son's life was not lost in vain. She is a quiet, deeply respectful but very strong woman, and she and her husband are working hard to ensure that no other family has to endure what they have endured. They will do whatever it takes to hold the government and the department to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waiting around for help and assistance can send people into a further downward spiral which is life-threatening, which is why the interim income support is such a vital part of this bill, because it will make such a big difference. Schedule 2 establishes the veteran payment and interim income support payment for those waiting for their mental health claims to be determined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the beginning of what governments can do to support our veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families in their time of greatest need. I am hoping that the two recommendations from the Senate inquiry on this bill being implemented will be the first of many more to come. I can't express enough that we must do better by our veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families. This is not about politics; this is actually about people's lives—people who have put their lives on the line for our safety and our freedom. Now it is up to us in this place to ensure that our veterans have access to all of the care and support that they need.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz; it is great to be in this chamber talking on this bill with you present as well, given our recent collaboration in relation to the Breaker Morant story, and I think we reflected at that time about the issue of the mental health concerns that arose in the context of that guerilla war campaign and the effects that it had on those individuals and the outcomes that can be consequential on those mental stresses in those intensely stressful and trying environments. I reflected on that being an experience replicated in a lot of the recent conflicts of the men and women of our ADF in those environments, where there's no front line, no place to rest and no escape from the pressure and the threat, and you can't identify an enemy readily. We've seen that from Vietnam to Somalia to Afghanistan and Iraq. We have a generation of veterans coming through now who have had these experiences and who, thankfully, have not had to go through what our Vietnam veterans went through with the way they were treated by society when they returned, which was incredibly shameful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I've reflected before about the experience of Frankie Hunt in the Bega Valley shire in my electorate. He was the Frankie from the song <span style="font-style:italic;">I Was Only 19</span> who suffered a terrible mine incident in Vietnam, but when he came back he spent a long period of time through rehabilitative surgery and treatment in Heidelberg hospital in Victoria. He recounts in the book that was written about the story of the song, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jungle Dark</span>, that one day a group of them were taken out to see a movie in Melbourne. They were all in wheelchairs and unable to walk, and it was during the height of the Vietnam demonstrations. As they got off the bus, a group of demonstrators saw them and one young lady in this group came over, was abusing Frankie and actually squashed a pie in his head. This is a guy in a wheelchair, a veteran of the Vietnam War, who's suffered terribly in the incident and the subsequent treatment, but Frankie's response—I won't use the full response—was, 'You forgot the sauce.' That says a lot about Frankie and his resilience and sense of humour. Hopefully, that illustrates a little the types of mental pressure these veterans were under. Frankie hung in there because of his mental resilience, but so many others were treated by their country at that time as pariahs. The extra pressure that that put on them mentally was enormous, and you can see how that generation of our veterans in particular has suffered probably in greater proportion than other veteran generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm now seeing the younger veterans coming through in my region and, I guess, my cohort as well. They don't feel like the RSL is something they can reach out to. They feel a bit alienated from that organisation and I think there's work to be done there. We've had our issues, of course, in New South Wales with the New South Wales RSLs going through a difficult period, but these veterans don't feel that's their place, necessarily, to resolve their issues. So we need to be a lot more creative in how we deal with the initial phases of people struggling with mental health issues from their experiences while they're serving and also in graduating that through and having a continuum of support through their post-service life—and I'll come back to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those pressures include just the pressures from service itself, let alone deployments. Some of the types of situations people get into in the obviously rigorous and dangerous training can be quite traumatic. I recall a grenade range incident while I was up at the 1st Division. A digger had crimped the pins on his grenades in his pouch to try and make it quicker to pull the grenades. A grenade went off in his pouch and set off another three grenades and he was literally blown to pieces, so you had limbs falling in front of his compatriots engaged in that exercise. So training at home also can be quite stressful and traumatic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stresses and strains on the families is another issue that I think can't be fully appreciated by the general community. I recall, every time that you would deploy, having to go through this process of doing your hero shot for if you're killed so that that's there for the media, sitting down and doing your will, and discussing the issues with your spouse and your family prior to departure. It's effectively a farewell process that you go through every time you deploy. The families go through that, and then you're not there, and you're not there for extended periods of time. I deployed something like five times. I put my family through that. You'd be away for six months to a year in circumstances like when I was in Somalia, where you couldn't even communicate with them in any way, shape or form. I remember that I managed to get one phone call in via satellite phone during that time we were in Somalia. The 18 minutes of conversation cost me about $300 at the time, which you had to pay for out of your own pocket. It was only later that things like email and Skyping have helped in that respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those families—okay, you're away, you're out of the house and you're not there to help, but they also don't know if you're going to come back at all. That's a unique aspect of the job that you don't find in many others. If they hear something on the news or hear a report, instantly it's the cold sweats, it's the chill up the spine and it's the concern. I remember—fortunately by Iraq we had communications that were better—one situation where I'd come under attack in one particular location and we had 26 casualties. I knew this was going to be on the news, but fortunately I was able to ring my wife and tell her, 'Look, it's all good; no damage done,' et cetera. Whenever they're in that situation, hearing that news—the sheer terror that they go through in those circumstances. Then you come back and you disrupt the life that they've built while you've been away and how they do things. And then they're there to try to pick up your pieces of however you may be feeling or going through your decompression over whatever. There's a lot of pressure on them through all of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen incidents in the past, too, in dealing with family members, because every generation of my family has served in the military. I remember, in particular, my father's father, my grandfather on my father's side, who served in the Middle East and in Java during the Second World War and was a prisoner of the Japanese on the Burma-Thailand Railway. I still have his loincloth from that experience to remind me: 'Don't complain. Harden up, princess.' He came back, obviously, with a lot of mental burdens. That generation who'd been prisoners were told to suck it up—to not impose your problems on anyone else or the family. They were internalising all of this, these horrendous experiences which we can't imagine that they endured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a terribly heartbreaking story, I had one constituent who was with her husband for 40 years, enduring these nightmares—you know, alcohol; times he'd wake up in the night and she would have his hands around her throat, choking her, thinking she was Japanese; and all that sort of stuff. It got to the point where she could no longer endure that. People were telling her that she had to leave the household because her life was at risk, and so she did. Within a short period of time, her husband passed away and she wasn't entitled to any of the war widows veterans support, because she had left him to basically save her own life. We were trying to work with Senator Sherry at the time to see if we could get some sort of ex gratia support for her. Unfortunately, she went into hospital to have a hip replacement, contracted septicaemia and died before we could sort that out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories are amplified across the nation with the thousands of veterans that we have to look after, so I'm really pleased that we've worked together across the chamber and across the houses to sort out a lot of these issues. There will be more to do. We have to make sure that the processes are human in this. That's the biggest single thing I get from veterans, that the entry point of getting into the support of the DVA is a traumatic experience in itself because it's complicated and there's a lot of paperwork, and a lot of them can't cope with that. It's an adversarial type of situation where you feel like you're being questioned and you have to prove yourself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard, of course, reference to the tragic Jesse Bird story, which led to his suicide. That brings us to this really dark issue of suicide at the moment. The numbers that we've experienced are absolutely staggering. I come back to this issue of needing to build on this now. I'm pleased that we've set up the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention group with my friend the member for Berowra. We're working through the different types of dynamics—youth suicide, Indigenous and LGBTQI pressures that we're aware of—but we also want to focus on this veterans' issue as well and help them find mechanisms to manage their stress and to reach out to help when they need it.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at some creative solutions, one solution that appeared to me was from a friend who was a fellow Iraq veteran who was having issues. He wanted to be on the land in the bush to deal with that, and it worked for him. He was leasing some farm area near Braidwood in the electorate and he invited out there other friends who were going through similar problems. By the time he was done with this, they'd built a residence out there where people could go to chill out. He had animal husbandry, farm mechanics, river restoration—all this stuff going on on this property that was really helping these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think we need to address people in the immediate circumstances. If you get in early with a lot of this stuff, you can choke off any festering or growth of the problem in later times. So we need to look at those creative solutions for how we help people decompress and how we make people more resilient as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with a veteran who went through a lot of this and produced a book. The guy's name was Todd Berry, and with Rob Ginnivan he wrote a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything's OK</span>. That's a really good start point for people looking for strategies. I must say that, in developing my own strategies, I felt that exercise was a great way to handle stress. Not looking in the rear-view mirror also helped me a lot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was brought home to me the other day when I had someone come to interview me from DVA doing a publication about Somalia. We're coming up to the 25th anniversary of that deployment. We had a very long interview, and I went back over that time. It reminded me of why I don't do that, because that night I actually did have an episode, and my poor wife sitting there nearly got punched while I was in the middle of a nightmare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is great work that guys like Todd and others are doing to reach out, admit their issues in situations and say: 'You're not alone. Let's talk together. Let's develop strategies. Here are the things that work for me. Here are things that seem to have worked for a lot of people.' I hope we can build a cohesive, continuing regime around managing veterans, because I think that was at the heart of what we were looking at with this reform of merging personnel with veterans in portfolio so that the data on each individual and each veteran can be maintained through. We basically should admit that we put these people through service and we basically own them for the rest of their time. That means not just dealing with clinical problems; one of the points that causes clinical issues is not having that transition period of leaving Defence and going into civilian life dealt with properly, and I'm glad to see we're developing a lot of strategies about helping them land in good civilian employment. That will address a lot of the transition issues that they need to cope with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend where we've gone with this legislation. As I said, there's more to be done, and I look forward to working together with my colleagues on finding solutions to these. Hopefully, through our committee, the parliamentary group on the prevention of suicide with my friend the member for Berowra will provide an opportunity for people who have these ideas to come forward and engage with both sides of politics and portfolio representatives. I know Greg Hunt, the Minister for Health, has been very supportive. Julie Collins, as well, has been to all of our activities. I look forward to that continuing and for us to be a conduit for solutions to all these problems to be brought forward to the policymakers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  I speak often in this place and elsewhere about my mission to make Fisher the place to be for education, employment and retirement, but I don't often explain what lies behind that statement. At the heart of my mission for Fisher are the hopes and aspirations that I had when I moved to the Sunshine Coast 25 years ago. They are the hopes and aspirations that are shared today by the thousands of Australians, young and old, who are moving into my electorate as we speak. People on the Sunshine Coast want to be able to get the best education for themselves and their children, they want to be able to get a meaningful and rewarding job in a career of their choice, and they want to be able to retire in comfort and dignity with the highest quality health care. Importantly, they want to be able to do all of that without having to leave our community and move to a big city. That's why I want to help make the Sunshine Coast the place to be for education, employment and retirement. I want people to be born on the Sunshine Coast or to move here and to be able to make that long-term commitment to our region, to live on the coast, work, put their roots down, make a contribution and help us build a prosperous and healthy community. That's what the people who come to the coast want and that is what I want to help them achieve for themselves and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For that to happen, the people of Fisher need to have the opportunity to fulfil one of the most important of their aspirations—that is, to own their own home. For most Australians, home ownership is a fundamental part of their financial security and, indeed, their life plan. It is the rock on which many things are built. For many years, as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, I was a builder, and I have seen the effect that owning a first home can have on a young family: the sense of achievement and the feeling of security and of belonging to a community. I want that for everyone in Fisher, for those who live here now and those who will join us in the coming years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Current projections suggest that we are likely to see more than 200,000 new residents moving to the Sunshine Coast by 2035. There is a transformative program of housing construction already underway. At Bokarina beach, Palmview, Beerwah east and at the two very large developments at Aura and Harmony, the construction of tens of thousands of new houses is under way. At Harmony, near Palmview, accommodation for as many as 17,000 new residents is being built, while at Aura, near Caloundra, 20,000 homes will house 50,000 new Sunshine Coasters over the next 30-odd years. According to the developer, Stockland, 70 per cent of those living in Aura will be owner-occupiers and 45 per cent of them will be new, or first, home buyers. Aura is a great example of how hardworking aspirational Australians can get out of the rent cycle and make a start in growing their family's prosperity for themselves and for future generations. Like Harmony and the other developments going on around the coast, Aura offers house-and-land packages targeted specifically at affordability, with prices well below the region's median house price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thousands of young families are taking up these opportunities and getting a foot on the housing ladder. Forty per cent of buyers to date are key workers like nurses, police officers and teachers. Some are even pest control operators, Mr Deputy Speaker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WALLACE:</span>
                    </a>  They are the hardworking mums and dads, the battlers, who want to get ahead to build a future for themselves and to give something back, who form the basis of any community's success. This sort of long-term commitment to community, this independence and determination to build one's own prosperity, is exactly what we need on the Sunshine Coast and, indeed, all over the country. Homeownership is one of the foundations of financial security. It's a starting point of from which to build and a statement of intent. I congratulate all of the new homeowners at Aura, Harmony, Beerwah East and all of the many developments around the Sunshine Coast on taking that important step on the path to prosperity. For those who are new to the coast, I want to thank them for making such a significant commitment to our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want that dream to be a reality for everyone in Fisher, but I'm well aware of the challenges facing my constituents. I know how hard it can be. That's why, back in April 2017, I held a housing affordability summit in my electorate at the Dicky Beach Surf Club. The Assistant Minister to the Treasurer joined us and representatives of Sunshine Coast developers, community groups and housing associations to discuss the challenges of affordable housing and housing affordability on the coast. I'm grateful to Paul Bidwell of Master Builders Queensland; Deb Blakeney of Lions inPlace; Kelli Dendle of CHASM; Andrew Elvin and Helen Glanville of Coast2Bay; Shane Goodwin and Warwick Temby of HIA; Tony Long of Affordable Housing; John McNamara of SMS Finance; Ben Simpson and Llew Gartrell of Stockland; Shane O'Brien of Vantage Homes; and Joy Morwood of Sunshine 60 &amp; Better for giving me their very broad feedback. This extremely useful session identified a range of factors increasing housing stress on Sunshine Coast. The summit identified the lack of availability of alternative finance approaches for homebuyers, layered taxation on new homes from multiple tiers of government and the so-called NIMBYism effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the assembled community groups identified the importance of stable employment in avoiding housing stress and making housing more affordable to more families. The Turnbull government has already made a massive difference in that area, creating around 1,100 new jobs every day over the past 12 months. In fact, 403,103 jobs in total were created, with more than 75 per cent of them being full time. Having a second income in a household makes it considerably easier to afford housing. More than 60 per cent of those new jobs last year were taken up by women, creating the highest female participation rate in our nation's history. With the unemployment rate on the Sunshine Coast even lower than the national average—the Sunshine Coast rate being 5.1 per cent—this is already making a huge difference in making housing affordable for more local families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important factor identified by the group was supply. The summit heard that some land on the Sunshine Coast had increased in value by more than 400 per cent, while the cost of building had increased by only 100 per cent. The number of land sales had more than halved in recent years. The developer Stockland pointed out that it had taken 14 years to get the Aura development set up, approved and commenced. In particular they noted the challenges of getting utilities and other infrastructure put in place for the sort of massive new developments that we need. The summit agreed that the most important way to deal with housing affordability on the coast was to get the right supply in the right place and at the right densities as quickly as possible. With more than 200,000 more people expected to move to the Sunshine Coast in the coming 20 years, we urgently need more supply. At my housing affordability summit we heard that for community groups the availability of finance and their comparatively small operations are barriers which reduce their ability to fill demand. For large developers the slow process of getting necessary infrastructure in place and the availability of land were the most important constraints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is these challenges of supply which the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018 so efficiently addresses. The establishment of a National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, with the real clout of $1 billion to spend, will make a real difference to unlocking housing supply in our community of Fisher and, indeed, throughout Australia. By aggregating the lending requirements of multiple community groups, the corporation will be able to reduce risk, reduce borrowing cost for community housing providers and create the scale needed for them to efficiently deliver the affordable housing that we need. With their large-scale funds and independent Commonwealth mandate, the corporation will also be able to intervene to ensure that key infrastructure is built more quickly, by addressing coordination issues and overcoming financial constraints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will also be a multiplier effect from this investment corporation which will work to boost the effectiveness of the government's other actions on housing affordability. The Turnbull government will unlock more Commonwealth land for development. The investment corporation will help to ensure that that land can be developed quickly and will help community groups to get involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is creating financial incentives for first home buyers and low- to middle-income Australians through the First Home Super Saver Scheme. The investment corporation enshrined in this bill will help to ensure that the supply needed to meet that fresh demand is available as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Sunshine Coast, the federal government has already done a great deal to help to give more people the chance to start their journey to prosperity, by putting in place the infrastructure that we need to grow. We have committed more than $1.6 billion to upgrades to the Bruce Highway in our region alone—which, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, you are no doubt aware of because your particular area is also the beneficiary of that expenditure of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has created a $10 billion National Rail Program, which could support upgrades to the North Coast rail, another initiative which would impact very favourably upon Mr Deputy Speaker's electorate of Petrie. We have improved telecommunications infrastructure with new mobile phone blackspot towers in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, while the government's reform of the NBN is ensuring that rollout is progressing throughout our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first home buyers moving into Aura, Harmony, Beerwah East and in fact all of the Sunshine Coast today should feel rightly proud of their achievements and excited about what the future holds for them and their families—that is, greater recognition and importance of the concepts of independence, self-reliance and growing success. I and the Turnbull government want that for everyone in Fisher and everyone, in fact, right across our nation. This government has a plan to make that dream more accessible to more people, and this bill is at the heart of that plan. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  Housing affordability is a huge issue in the electorate that I represent. Over the course of the last decade in particular, we've seen massive growth in the cost of housing both for purchasers and for renters, and that growth has gone on unabated. In fact, in the suburb that I live in the cost of housing has increased by 16 per cent over the course of the last year. That's one year alone. There is this notion that the heat is coming out of the housing market in Sydney. Well, we're not seeing it in the electorate that I represent. And, of course, it's putting a lot of cost-of-living pressure on households.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are households now faced with very, very low wages growth—and wages are only growing at around two per cent a year now—but, if you look at the Wage Price Index data this week, you see data on median average incomes which suggests that they've fallen below the inflation rate, so households are actually going backwards. When you factor in electricity prices, electricity prices have risen outrageously under this government because it can't get its act together and get a policy together that provides investment certainty for renewables, so the cost of electricity has gone up dramatically. Private health insurance has increased once again. It's been ticked off by this government and premiums have increased dramatically. There have been big increases in the cost of child care and huge increases in the cost of education, and, of course, the cost of housing added to that means that families are struggling. They are struggling to make ends meet, but, at the same time, this government is proposing a tax increase with an increase in the Medicare levy and putting more and more pressure on households.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For years now, experts and the Australian citizens have been saying, 'We need a circuit breaker in our housing market. We need a fair dinkum set of policies that will take the pressure off house prices and make living in Australia, particularly in the capital cities, more affordable.' All of those experts point to the fact that Australia has the largest and most generous tax concessions around housing, particularly the deductibility of interest payments on loans, in the world. They are the most generous and the benefits of those tax deductions go predominantly to well-off Australians—those who are in the higher income brackets. I'm talking, of course, of negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. When these were introduced by the Howard government—interestingly, by the Treasurer that those opposite like to provide accolades to, Treasurer Costello—they weren't funded in the budget, particularly the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax. This was in a period when Australia was earning quite a bit of revenue from the mining boom and the Howard government squandered it, basically. They squandered it on tax deductions for wealthy Australians that were unfunded. In other words, there was no mechanism in the budget to fund that revenue that was lost because of these tax deductions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're an investor in the housing market these days going along to an auction on a Saturday, you can go along armed with the fact that this government is going to give you a tax deduction. It's going to support you through negative gearing. If you're a first home buyer going along to buy a home that you want to live in, you get nothing from the government—no support whatsoever. That is the great shame of this government when it comes to supporting hardworking Australians. If you're a first home buyer you get no support, but, if you're an investor that may be looking to negatively gear their seventh or eighth investment property, you'll get support from the government—and that's wrong. The beneficiaries of that are those in the highest income tax brackets. For negative gearing, I think 50 per cent of the benefit of negative gearing goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. It's even higher for the capital gains tax discount, because, when you sell the property, you get a 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax if it's an investment property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those measures are too generous and they're adding heat to the housing market. All of the good economists in Australia have recognised that and have been recommending reform of that for many years. It's only Labor that's listened to them and listened to the Australian public. Labor proposed reform at the last election and continues to propose it as we move forward to the next election. Not only will this generate additional revenue for the budget, estimated at about $30 billion over the course of a decade; it will also operate to take some of that heat out of the housing market. If you look at the housing market as a pot of boiling water, it's akin to turning down the heat a little bit. People's house prices aren't going to go down, as was suggested by the Prime Minister—and, let's face it, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services actually suggested that they might go up. She was saying that they'll go up; the Prime Minister was saying they'll go down. They couldn't work out a consistent message. It was a scare campaign that wasn't based on fact, and that was the reason why they were saying those things. The reality is that it will simply take some of the heat out of the housing market and ensure that first home buyers can compete.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also offered a number of other reforms that we believe will assist with housing affordability, most notably by proposing a uniform vacant properties tax for capital cities above a certain population level. Labor, working in concert with state governments, proposed a tax for properties that remain vacant as a deterrent for people to buy properties and then leave them with no-one in them. Wealthy individuals are the only ones who can afford to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also proposed a bond aggregator, and the subject of this particular bill is the establishment of a national housing finance and investment corporation that would have responsibility for the operation of a bond aggregator scheme to ensure that housing affordability is improved and administer a facility to enable developers to look at housing affordability and developing properties that are affordable. These bills do give effect to the government's announcement in the 2017-18 budget that it would establish a national housing finance and investment corporation and operate an affordable-housing bond aggregator and administer the national housing infrastructure facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bond aggregator will bring together the lending requirements of a number of community housing providers and finance those requirements by issuing bonds to institutional investors. The national housing infrastructure facility is intended to provide financial assistance of up to $1 billion in the form of occasional loans, grants and other financial instruments. The facility comprises $600 million for concessional loans, $225 million for equality and equity investment, and $175 million in grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, as I said, announced, as part of our plan for housing affordability and jobs, in 2017, that we would establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing. Whilst this bill doesn't exactly mirror what Labor was proposing, what we've said is that we won't oppose it in the House but we will send it to a Senate inquiry to ensure that it fulfils the obligations for which it was established. And they should be: to help community housing providers access cheap finance, to provide for new affordable rental housing. A housing bond aggregator should also directly source cumulative funds from wholesale markets on behalf of community housing providers by issuing bonds to private investors. Funds raised by those bond issues could then be loaned to providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for the appointment of a board to administer the facility, and the criteria and skills that are required for a person to be appointed to that board, noting that they would be appointed on a part-time basis. It also outlines the powers of the Treasurer regarding the board and the directions that the Treasurer can make to the board, particularly in respect of the investment mandate of the board. Importantly, it also ensures that there is an investment mandate for this particular board and that they operate within the bounds of the intent of the regulations and true to that goal of improving housing affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, can I say that, whilst this is a step in the right direction, we do have some misgivings about whether or not it will fulfil those obligations. But I go back to the point that I made earlier: unless you are tackling the outrageous tax concessions, the overly generous tax concessions, that exist around negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts in the Australian housing market, you are not fair dinkum about housing affordability, and many, many economists have pointed that out. It's a shame that this government is beholden to the development lobby and unable to make that brave decision and act in the interests of Australians, particularly first home buyers, and institute reform to negative gearing and capital gains tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their absence, a future Labor government will, by restricting negative gearing to new investment properties, ensure that we grow jobs in that industry—it has been estimated, by about 25,000 a year—and ensure that there is still the possibility to negatively gear a property but only on new investments, so that first home buyers aren't competing with investors on existing housing stock, and that generally means the bottom of the market, where they go in on existing housing stock, particularly the unit market. Importantly, we will be removing and reducing that outrageous discount that exists for capital gains tax, which was unfunded when it was introduced into the budget by the Howard government. So it's Labor that's acting and listening to the Australian people when it comes to housing affordability.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018 establishes a new independent corporate Commonwealth entity which will strengthen efforts to improve housing outcomes for Australians. The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation will be a financial intermediary with broad functions to enable it to administer an affordable housing bond aggregator and the $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility. The affordable housing bond aggregator will improve the efficiency of financing for community housing providers, enabling them to strengthen housing outcomes. It works by providing cheaper and longer term finance for community housing providers by aggregating their borrowing requirements and issuing bonds into the market at a lower cost than the traditional big banks would. It will operate in a similar fashion to the British bond aggregator, The Housing Finance Corporation, which has helped administer five billion pounds in loans to housing associations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility will help increase the stock and accelerate the supply of housing. It will do so by recognising the importance of early investment in speeding up supply and complementing private sector and state and local government investment. The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation will be established as a Commonwealth entity governed by an independent skills based part-time board. The board will comprise experts from a range of fields to ensure decisions are robust, responsible and rigorously assessed. The independence of the board in financing affordable housing projects will be paramount. The government will not be able to direct it to make or reject specific investments. The bill includes a government guarantee of all the corporation's liabilities to support market confidence in its housing investments. This legislative guarantee will drive the best price outcome for community housing providers and provide certainty for investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill today is the result of significant ongoing work and consultation, reflected by the supportive stakeholder feedback. I congratulate the assistant minister for his efforts. Compass Housing Services declared:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compass strongly supports the NHIC and its potential to address infrastructure bottlenecks that impede development of additional housing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a positive step to delivering greater numbers of affordable housing dwellings to low to moderate income earners.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When government consults widely as part of a comprehensive, careful and calibrated plan, the end result is legislation enjoying broader support from the sector and its stakeholders. The creation of the NHFIC is fundamentally good news for the housing market in Australia. We're speeding up the supply of new housing through the provision of loans, grants and cheaper longer term finance to registered community housing providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation delivers on a key element of the government's comprehensive housing affordability plan to improve housing outcomes for all Australians. The Turnbull government is committed to ensuring all Australians have access to secure, stable and affordable housing. Australia is one of the great home owning democracies of the world. Purchasing your own home is at the heart of the Australian dream; we want that opportunity to continue, and we want to make it as achievable as possible. In my electorate of Berowra in the northern suburbs of Sydney the cost of housing is a source of frustration and stress for many young families trying to break into the market. It's also of great concern to older parents keen to see their children and grandchildren secure their own homes. My electorate encompasses a diverse range of suburbs, but they share a common experience of rapidly rising housing prices in the last five years or so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, Pennant Hills and Hornsby are two commercial and suburban centres in the area. Both are 25 to 30 kilometres, or a 45-minute train trip, from the CBD. Traditionally both suburbs have been home to young families starting out, buying or building their first home, raising their children and getting involved in the local community. In the last six years the median house price in both suburbs has effectively doubled. In Pennant Hills the median house price currently sits at $1.57 million; properties in Hornsby attract $1.28 million on average. Galston is a quiet, semirural suburb 20 minutes from the centre of Hornsby and 40 kilometres from the CBD. By car it takes an hour in light traffic and costs $14.43 in tolls one way. The fastest journey by public transport—bus—is around one hour and 20 minutes, although there are other, slower options. Due to Sydney's transport difficulties, some days it can take hours to get into the city. Median house prices in Galston have risen nine per cent since 2011, with a median property today selling for $1.22 million. Finally, in Cherrybrook, a popular family suburb in my electorate 30 kilometres from the city, house prices there have jumped 106 per cent in just six years to an average $1.53 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young families want to take advantage of the opportunities by living in these beautiful thriving areas close to where they grew up themselves, close to their families, friends and communities, close to their church groups and schools and sports clubs yet the feedback I'm given is that this dramatic price growth is putting them under considerable and unsustainable pressure. It is not uncommon for my constituents to be carrying mortgages in the high six-figures or close to $1 million simply to provide a home for their families. In Berowra, 41.7 per cent of dwellings are owned with a mortgage, well above the state and national average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear all too often about the impact of mortgage stress on families. The cost of servicing these large mortgages combined with paying very high road tolls—my constituents are the most tolled people in Sydney—the cost of child care and the rising cost of living means many people are feeling the pinch. In pursuit of the great Australian dream, my constituents work hard to provide for their loved ones. Doing so requires considerable sacrifice. Nearly half of all working people in Berowra, 47.1 per cent, work more than 40 hours a week and that is three per cent above the state average and four per cent above the national average. In addition, many travel over an hour each day each way to work. It is clear my constituents are working harder and longer to save for or pay off their homes. When they come home from work and look at their children, many of them question how their kids will be able to afford property in Sydney when they grow up. It is these issues that I hear about time and again from my constituents and it is why I support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no one silver bullet to housing affordability; however, the government's reducing pressure on housing affordability plan helps us strive towards the goal of providing opportunity and accessibility for first home buyers, and security and stability for homeowners. We have a dual responsibility to represent the best interests of both purchasers and owners because housing is so critical to the social and economic wellbeing of Australians and the economy as a whole. Unlike Labor, who will take a tax sledgehammer to the market through the removal of negative gearing and a 50 per cent increase in capital gains tax, we recognise the sensitivities of the sector to the economy and the importance of a responsible approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NHFIC bill is part of the coalition's package of measures to address housing affordability. While we rightly look forward to the benefits of the bill, the government can also take pride in the benefits delivered from the implementation of is housing affordability plan so far. In 2015, the coalition committed to cracking down on foreign investment, including fees to acquire real estate and tougher penalties for investors who break the rules. We are upholding strict standards to ensure foreigners are not allowed to buy existing homes. Since coming to government, we have enforced the sale of illegally purchased properties worth more than $100 million compared to Labor who did not sell a single illegal property while in power. We make no apologies for our tough stance. Foreign investment in housing should never be at the expense of the Australian dream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In early 2017, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority introduced lending restrictions on banks to discourage riskier forms of lending to pay for what were, in some cases, overheated property prices. Led by the Treasurer, this government warned the regulators that they needed to crack down harder on high-risk loans. It required banks to limit the flow of new interest-only lending to 30 per cent of the total residential mortgages. The clampdown on interest-only lending had the desired effect, cooling overheated elements of the investor market with interest-only diving 44.8 per cent during the September quarter. This has helped take the heat out of risky investments in the housing market and suppress runaway growth in housing prices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whereas growth in Sydney at the start of last year was running on average at over 15 per cent, it's now down to a more accessible five per cent but that's still five per cent off a very high base. Fewer international investors participating in the market provides greater opportunities for first home buyers to get their foot in the door and this has been confirmed by the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The number of loans to first home buyers hit a five-year high in November, making up 18 per cent of overall owner-occupier home loans. Concurrently, loans to property investors in November recorded an 8.3 per cent fall year on year. This latest data is promising. But changes to macro prudential rules are not the only measure currently making a real difference.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December, the Turnbull government legislated the First Home Super Saver Scheme, despite rampant resistance from Labor. This scheme is giving young people a leg up in the housing market through a tax cut which will allow them to save for a deposit inside their superannuation. First home buyers can contribute up to $30,000 into their superannuation, which they can then draw upon at a generous concessional tax rate for the purchase of their first home. For a young couple this means a combined contribution of up to $60,000. This will allow most first home buyers to accelerate their savings by at least 30 per cent. The impact of this supercharged boost to their deposit saving should not be underestimated. We've empowered first home buyers to take control of their financial future through less tax and a savings scheme that rewards their ongoing strides to home ownership. Labor didn't support this approach. They refused to help first home buyers save a deposit, and they refused to recognise the benefits of supercharged savings for young Australians. Labor argued that the scheme would damage the superannuation system, refusing to put faith in the ability of individuals to know what's best for themselves. This government takes a different view. We believe in all Australians. We believe in their ability to salary sacrifice and save in a smart manner so they can achieve that Australian dream, the goal of home ownership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of these measures cannot be anywhere near as meaningful if supply isn't similarly addressed. That's why in December last year we legislated important incentives for older Australians to downsize from their family home. From 1 July this year, Australians aged 65 will be able to consider the financial rewards of downsizing. When they sell property they have owned for at least 10 years downsizers will be able to contribute up to $300,000 from the proceeds into their superannuation accounts above and over existing contribution restrictions. In the case of a couple, both can take advantage and collectively contribute $600,000 from a sale into super. This is a fantastic piece of news for older Australians looking for a way to strengthen their super savings and make the next move in their lives. Constituents have already contacted me advising that they will be taking advantage of this measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a record of delivering solutions to the sector, but we know it's a complicated issue and the federal government alone cannot transform the market. So I'm always encouraged and pleased to advocate on behalf of the people of Berowra who are taking steps to contribute to the process, people like Peter Coyle from Mt Colah, who heads up Absolute Shipping and Modular Homes. Peter recently came to parliament to discuss his proposal to provide high-quality housing through the use of shipping container materials. Peter's company prides itself on its fast completion times, high standards and fair pricing, offering the kind of creative proposals we need in the market. Its modular homes can be ready to move into in 90 days, with a cost to government of about one-third of the current cost of public housing. Peter's company is Australian owned and run and offers innovative designs to its diverse clientele. I applaud my constituent Peter Coyle for his work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also actively looking at solutions to a tight housing market is Russell Garnett from Urban Revolutions, a company building 26 affordable microvillas in the Hills district. Russell's approach recognises that housing affordability is an issue that affects all corners of our community, not just families with children. From those affected by family breakdown to young people who are leaving their home for the first time, it's essential we look for ways to ensure affordable and quality housing for all Australians. Russell hopes that choosing the option of a high-quality microvilla might allow low- and middle-income workers to save for a deposit in three to four years instead of the average 11 to 12 years. Russell's efficient approach relies on creative design paired with community vision, building new developments that incorporate a range of shared community spaces along with a smaller apartment. In providing affordable but attractive housing options, Urban Revolutions offers more opportunities for aspiring homeowners to enter the market, regardless of their family size or structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that is addressing affordability for my constituents. As the government aims to address affordability for the people of Australia, I'm determined to see the people of Berowra benefit too. My constituents work hard to bring up their families, and I want them to know I'm working hard for them here. We often discuss the problems associated with the housing market through the lens of simply providing a roof over one's head. For many in Berowra the access to and affordability of good housing is a lot more than that. Sir Robert Menzies said that a home gave people a stake in the country, and he meant this in terms of homes material, homes human and homes spiritual. We don't just want Australians to have houses, we want them to have good homes—places of family and familiarity. That's the Australian dream. It's why I'm so pleased at the outcomes already being achieved by the government. Fairfax's Domain publication just last month reported that the amount of time first home buyers spend looking for a property has dropped from between 60 and 90 days to between 30 and 40 days. ANZ research reveals that since July 2017 the number of monthly first home buyer approvals has risen more than 60 per cent in New South Wales and 50 per cent in Victoria. The coalition is ensuring the Australian dream is still achievable. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  In speaking on these bills, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018 and the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, debated jointly, can I say that it seems almost a contradiction that we live at a time of very low interest rates, yet housing has never been more unaffordable. Indeed, we see falling home ownership rates and have done so for several years. This is at a time when interest rates, certainly in my recollection, have never been lower. It is not just now that they have never been lower; we are talking about several years. The reality is that, for many of the younger generation, their dream of ever owning their own home will never be realised, unless they have a rich parent, which was the view of a previous Treasurer of the coalition government. He said that, if you wanted to own your own home, just be born into a family with rich parents. Of course, you could inherit a home from your parents once they die. Even that is becoming more risky because, as we know, many elderly people are no longer able to maintain their own home and are entering into a reverse mortgage situation to survive themselves. By the time they come to the end of their life, one wonders what they will have to pass on to their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Home ownership for the younger generation is, quite frankly, a matter that seriously concerns me. It concerns me because I believe that home ownership is important. Home ownership is what creates family stability. It also creates community stability. When people own their own home, they take an interest in the community in which their home exists because they are part of it. If they don't own their own home, they know full well that they may float from one residential area to another. They lose the sense of belonging to a community that in turn reaches out to provide all of the community facilities and support structures that are required in order to have a healthy community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that today the value of a home is 10 times or more the annual salary of a person who works. Fifty years ago, it was three or four times more. We can see that there's been a huge shift with respect to how expensive owning a home is today compared to four or five decades ago. That, in my view, reflects a serious national public policy failure on the part of both federal governments and state governments, which share the responsibility for home ownership. For most people, the issue of owning their own home goes to the heart of their financial planning. A home, whether you are paying a mortgage or renting, accounts for the largest amount of weekly outlay for most people. Whether you rent or own your home, it doesn't make a lot of difference because, in both cases, it goes to your hip pocket, affordability and the cost of living. The reality is that, as housing prices go up, so do rents, so the two go hand-in-hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe there are several reasons why housing affordability is declining. Firstly, it goes to state governments and the demise of their investment in housing. Years ago, state governments invested considerably in public housing, particularly in the sixties and seventies. The rate of investment by the state governments across Australia has dropped, and perhaps it's dropped because they have received less funds from the federal government as well. But it has dropped, and so we've seen a decline in public housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we have seen the closure of public banks that in years gone by were established with the prime purpose of providing low-interest loans for housing. Certainly in South Australia that was the prime objective of the State Bank of South Australia. Yes, it branched out into other areas later on, but initially that's what it was set to do, and it did indeed provide lower interest loans specifically for housing than did all of the competitive public banks in the state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, we have state and local governments now charging for infrastructure up front, which means that the cost of the land on which the houses are built has reached a point where it well exceeds the cost of the house itself. That's because the infrastructure is being paid for up front. That was never the case before. The houses were built and then through the rates paid local governments and state governments in turn provided the utilities and other infrastructure that was required, sometimes over many years. In some of the older parts of Adelaide there are streets that still do not have all of their footpaths, but it is an ongoing program for those councils and they will ultimately get their footpaths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth matter is the negative gearing tax laws that have been talked about time and time again and which the coalition government simply turns its back on but which are adding considerably to the cost of housing. The Grattan Institute suggests that each year about $5 billion is added to the annual cost to revenue as a result of negative gearing tax laws. We then have discounted capital gains tax laws as well, which add about another $7 billion to the cost to revenue, according to the Grattan Institute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, we have the incursion of foreign buyers. I'm aware there is another piece of legislation that tries to address that matter, and it's a matter that I have been talking about for several years. The incursion of foreign buyers has made a difference to the price of housing in Australia and it will continue to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is a rather paltry response to what is indeed a very serious issue. The legislation establishes a $1 billion fund to assist with housing in Australia. I'm not sure over what period the $1 billion is meant to last, but it establishes a $1 billion fund. The reality is that to me it looks more like a $1 billion slush fund. It's made up of $600 million as concessional loans, $225 million in equity investments and $175 million in grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's look at who can apply for these funds. Essentially, the money is targeted towards state and local government entities. Concessional loans are of little value to state and local government entities when they already have access to low-interest loans through their own financial institutions. For example, in the state where I come from, the South Australian Local Government Finance Authority already sources low-interest loans on behalf of councils through its own means. It doesn't need the federal government to provide it with low-interest loans. And so I see little value in having a low-interest loan facility for entities that already have that access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, with respect to the equity investments and the possibility of grants, I have a real concern that those entities—local governments and state governments—may well apply for funds to fund infrastructure and projects that they would otherwise already be responsible for and that they will simply be reaching out for money that's available to fund existing commitments that they have. And so again I have some real concern about that source of funding. I see the fund being used in a way which it was never intended for even if it is for a project which the council doesn't have on its books now or the state government doesn't have on its books right now but may well in the future. It will simply say, 'In the past we would have relied on a different source of funding stream, but now we can actually apply to the federal government and see if we can get a grant, a loan or an equity investment in order to fund works that otherwise we are responsible for.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other matters that concern me with this legislation and one of them goes to this: because local and state governments have off-loaded their housing development responsibilities of past years, they have been left with little expertise in the housing market. So for them to now access funds for what I would suggest are going to be relatively small projects in comparison to what they used to do, it means they do not have the expertise to manage those projects in the most efficient way. If they were going to go back into public housing in a big way, they would establish the departments and the key personnel that they need to be able to get back to an efficient level. But they won't if they're just dealing with projects here and there. So I see that there are inefficiencies in handing money to organisations who currently do not have the expertise to be in the housing market. That certainly does concern me. Even if they can build the properties as efficiently as the free market can, where are the savings if they are no cheaper than what the free market can build? Where are the savings to the end user who is ultimately going to be the person or family who rents or buys that property? There will be none. If there are none, how is this going to help with housing affordability in Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't know from this legislation just what conditions will apply to the loans or grants, who is going to be able to get them and how they will actually be managed, because those are decisions that are going to be made by the board. The qualifications of the board members, just looking at the list I've seen, would suggest that they are all going to be the professional class of people that we have in this country. There is no representation from perhaps real people, real families or working people; they are all white-collar professionals. Yes, we should have some of those, but I'm not convinced it should be made up entirely of that class of person. More importantly, they are going to be hand-picked by the minister. We know full well that the minister will pick the people that he or she chooses not necessarily for the reason that they are the best people for the position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the board will be exempt from freedom of information provisions with respect to who they make grants to, who they provide loans to, who they invest with, et cetera. The argument there is that they're dealing with commercial-in-confidence documentation, so the freedom of information provisions shouldn't apply. Given that most of the applicants for this funding are likely to be state or federal government bodies—in fact, that's almost one of the criteria of the legislation—why shouldn't the public have the right to know what other government departments are doing with their money? I believe they should. I believe that the freedom of information denial in this legislation is inappropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I have concerns about this legislation because, quite frankly, as I said from the outset, I see it as an opportunity by the government of the day for pork barrelling. I don't see enough clarity about how the funds will be used, how they will result in cheaper housing for people and how the broader Australian community is likely to benefit. I do see it as a paltry way of this government suggesting that they are doing something about affordable housing. I understand the legislation is going to be referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I welcome that because I believe some of the matters I have raised may well be addressed as part of those hearings. I certainly look forward to hearing from the committee in terms of their report back to parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last comment I make is in respect of the member for Berowra, when he talked about the government's own initiatives in this respect. The initiative about putting superannuation funds towards a person's housing simply says to the Australian people, 'You can have superannuation for your retirement or you can have housing, but you cannot have both.' Quite frankly, that is not an appropriate way to deal with this serious problem. What we are trying to do is give people a home and let them have their home and a life after they retire.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  I rise today to speak on the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018. The bill establishes the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, which is designed to operate a housing bond aggregator and administer the National Housing Infrastructure Facility. Once established, this corporation is intended to issue bonds to financial investors and then provide financial assistance to meet the lending requirements of multiple community housing providers. The financial assistance in this will be provided through concessional loans, grants and other financial instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year in April, which is almost 12 months ago, Labor announced that we would establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing. That was a year ago. We in Labor are focused on helping community housing providers to access cheaper finance to invest in new affordable rental housing. This was back in April last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Housing Infrastructure Facility is intended to provide financial assistance of up to $1 billion. The facility comprises $600 million for concessional loans, $25 million in equity investment and $175 million in grants. Last year we were worried that the announcement of the $1 billion infrastructure facility was simply a Liberal slush fund, because there were no details about the allocation of funds. In fact Treasury, at Senate estimates, had said that nothing had yet been set in stone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sets out the corporation's function to make loans, investments and grants to improve, directly or indirectly, housing outcomes; determine terms and conditions of these loans, investments and grants; and provide, to registered community housing providers, business advisory services and other assistance in capacity building. The bill also establishes the corporation's board, whose members must have appropriate qualifications and skills or experience in one of the following fields: banking, finance, law, housing, infrastructure planning, financing, local government or public policy. There is no diversity, though, in that board—not one person who is an end user of these houses, not one person who is an ordinary, average member of the community, not a single person on this board who represents someone who will benefit from this kind of housing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill states that the Treasurer may give the board of the corporation directions about the performance of the corporation's functions, which constitute the investment mandate. The investment mandate may include, and is not limited to, the strategies and policies to be followed for the corporation to function effectively; decision-making criteria for making loans, investments and grants, granting financial assistance to the states and territories and providing services and assistance to community housing providers; and risk and return relating to the corporation's investments. We need to ensure transparency on this board. The fact is that the Treasurer or the minister directly responsible for this is in charge of everything to do with it and there is no transparency whatsoever. They have already said that they will not be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been leading the policy arguments and the policy debates in the areas of housing and housing affordability. If we left it up to the guy from Point Piper also known as the Prime Minister, I don't think we'd have any action at all, because you'd need to be from the real world to understand the real-life problems that people in everyday communities are facing. The Turnbull government is lacking commitment on affordable housing, and it has failed millions of Australians when it comes to adequately dealing with housing affordability. It is not doing enough, quite frankly, to understand what the future needs for affordable or community housing will be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've heard over the last couple of years in the debates from those in the government has been that you can get rich parents. You can simply own a house by just having a couple of wealthy parents. Just choose your birth family when you're in utero, somewhere along the way, and get a couple of rich parents. If that doesn't work, you could always follow the former Deputy Prime Minister's advice, and you could move into the country. Well, we all know why he moved to the country—because there was free rent. Or you could just stop eating avocado on toast. That was going to be the other solution. I've not been eating avocado on toast for quite a number of weeks now, and I still can't afford to buy my own home. The Prime Minister is the richest landlord in this country, which goes to the point about him being completely out of touch on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a surprise that we have the lowest rates of homeownership in this country in about 40 years. The population out in Western Sydney, which I have the very great honour and privilege to represent, continues to rise—we'll have more people living out there on the west side of Parramatta than we will on the east—but so too do house prices, and housing affordability in my community is a massive, massive problem. Working men and women are being forced to work longer and harder to scrape together a deposit, yet the goalposts keep on shifting further and further away because of the price rises that are flooding that market so very quickly. They deserve to be able to afford their own home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only plan that the Liberals have on this is to allow young people to draw down on their superannuation, which will only give first home buyers more money, put more heat into the market and push up house prices even further. Only Labor has a real solution to tackling this problem. We've been working hard to put together policies that will be fair and ensure that hardworking men and women in communities like Lindsay can afford a home. The Prime Minister and this out of touch government simply don't understand the problem, so they'll never be able to find or fill a solution. I mean, it is pretty hard, looking out from Point Piper, to understand that the rest of the world doesn't stop at the Harbour Bridge! There's a whole community, there's a whole world beyond that Harbour Bridge view. They're more interested in giving a leg up to wealthy property investors than in making the system fairer for first home owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor know that it is an issue of fairness, so we're putting forward comprehensive policies that make it fairer for families to own their own home. More than two years ago, Bill Shorten launched federal Labor's housing affordability policies, reforms to negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. I'm not going to lie, when that first came out I was a little bit scared. I thought, 'Well, this is going to be problematic for us.' But as we talked through this reform and why it was important to people in my community—as I had conversations with people at railway stations, on their front doorsteps, in shopping centres and at mobile offices—people understood it. People that owned second homes and were using them as their superannuation investment or as their nest egg started to understand, too, that this was a problem. There is an appetite, I will say, amongst some responsible property owners who have investment properties, to keep their investment properties affordable. They know that they are not served by rents being so extraordinarily high that no-one will ever be able to afford to rent there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are starting to get on board with Labor's plans because they understand that there needs to be some change in the space. Unfortunately, though, we don't see the Prime Minister concerning himself at all with the need to reform negative gearing or capital gains tax. He's more concerned about the $65 billion he wants to give away to his big mates at the big end of town, let alone understanding that people in my electorate care about the cost of living, stagnant wages and how much the weekly budget is to put a roof over their family's heads. The roof over their heads is simply that, a roof over their heads. You cannot make a home in a property where you're determined by a landlord or where you are stuck in a rental cycle. That's a temporary solution; that does not make a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the Liberals promise to make power bills $550 cheaper per year, but what happened? Households in Sydney have had an annual bill increase of close to $1,000 since 2013, adding massive pressure to the already stretched budgets of these families. Our reforms to negative gearing and the capital gains discounts return $39 billion to the budget bottom line, but more importantly they put first home buyers on a level playing field with property investors.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week we had the International Monetary Fund release its latest article for consultation with Australia. I always come into this place and I say that I'm not an expert on all of these things. It is our responsibility, it is our duty, to defer to the experts. When it comes to the International Monetary Fund providing advice, they're expressly stating:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the investment side, the combination of high capital gains discount rates and unlimited negative gearing can encourage leveraged real estate investment in market upswings. While similar tax incentives are also present in other countries, they tend to be more limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the most generous concessions for investment homeowners in the entire world. The International Monetary Fund goes even further, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The capital gains discounts on housing should be reduced and other tax incentives limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that's the International Monetary Fund's advice to us. It is pertinent that we listen to experts when it comes to making decisions about things that affect the rest of the country, not opinions and things that we think will make us friends. The IMF endorsed changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The IMF surmises that the Commonwealth's housing tax settings favour leveraged housing investments in upswings that might encourage excess demand for housing—a point that federal Labor has been making year on year while we've been in opposition. Only federal Labor has a plan to tackle the housing affordability issue for all Australians, establishing a bond aggregator, boosting homeless support and re-establishing the National Housing Supply Council and a federal minister for housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need long-term commitment to a long-term problem that is not going to go away. We know that the fastest-growing group of homeless people in this country is our older women. They get into that situation for a number of reasons, but it is not acceptable that women in their 50s and 60s are becoming homeless because of this absolute travesty that is allowed to unfold because the government are so stagnant on taking any action. Where are the coalition's real plans for affordable community and public housing for our most vulnerable people, like these women, who need access to housing? They come at it with a piecemeal approach. Where is the community infrastructure in these developments? Communities don't just need a roof over their heads; they also need transport, medical service, education options and, most of all, jobs located nearby. We see the government lacking in answers, lost for real solutions to the growing issues of inequality in the housing markets and the impact on struggling families. You don't need to go any further than to listen to their comments about 'getting rich parents'. I'm surprised they've stopped short of saying, 'Get a rich husband or get a rich spouse.' I'm sure that we're not too far from hearing that from one of them, though.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the National Housing Infrastructure Facility was first announced last year, we had concerns that it was going to be a $1 billion slush fund. While the exposure draft of the investment mandate direction suggest this is less likely to be the case, concerns remain over the extent to which the facility will actually contribute to increasing the stock of affordable housing. We do want more than greenfields portfolio developments and investments for new private market owner-occupied housing or new private market investment rental housing that line the pockets of already wealthy investors. We want real solutions to the crisis facing the affordable housing market and those people who are directly affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, we're not going to oppose the passage of this bill through the House, and it will go through a Senate inquiry to ensure those issues are properly dealt with. We need to do more to tackle housing affordability and meet the pressures and demands on the Australian housing market—and we need to stop stalling. We need to stop with the excuses and the inaction and actually get on with it. I come into this place, day in, day out, to listen to those in government constantly blame us for everything that goes wrong. I don't know if they've realised that they're in government or that they've been in government for the last five, going on six, years now. They've suffered through a couple of Prime Ministers and a couple of Deputy Prime Ministers. I get it—it's a thing—but they need to actually take that position of privilege and power and do something with it for people who most need it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  We've got a housing crisis in Australia. When you have a situation where young people look at not only owning a home as being out of reach but even renting a home in an area near where they might work or study as being, for many, far more than they can afford, then you know you have a problem. It is reflected in the historically low homeownership rates. It is harder than ever for young people to get into the housing market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no surprise considering the way that we've set up our tax system in this country, which gives incentives and billions of dollars every year to people who've already got two, three or four houses. They can go and buy an extra one if they already have a home and get a big tax break from the government, but, if you're a first homeowner, you sit back and watch, auction after auction, as the bids just keep going up and up because the people who are buying the houses probably already have a house or two, and they know that, no matter how much the house costs, if they rent it out and write it off as a loss, they will get a big cheque from the government to cover some of that loss. Not only that, in a few years time they'll get to sell that house and get a tax cut on the proceeds from selling it as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The system is rigged against first home owners and the system is increasingly rigged against young people in general. We're talking about people who might think about having the dream of owning their own home one day, but, when you see that about one in three young people in this country either haven't got a job or don't have enough hours of work so that they've got a job but haven't got enough income, you start to understand that we are reaching crisis point in this country. A big part of the reason that we are in this situation is, as I've said, our tax system, which gives billions of dollars a year to people who've already got a home to buy their second, third or fourth home, but also, in the last few years, governments have stopped doing one of their core functions, which is to make sure that people's humans rights are being respected—and that includes the right to have a roof over your head.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments should look at housing the same way that they look at schools or hospitals. If we turned away hundreds of thousands of people from schools every year because there simply weren't enough schools built, or we weren't paying enough teachers, there would be an outcry—and rightly so. But governments seem to think it's okay that we've got tens of thousands of people in one state alone being homeless, and a public housing waiting list of between 30,000 and 50,000 in my state of Victoria. People seem to think that's okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to my electorate, the last time I looked at the stats, my electorate had more public housing than any other electorate in the country. You see it in those big tower blocks as you head into and out of and around Melbourne, and you see it in all the low-rises as well. But most of those were built in the sixties or seventies, and there hasn't been a government, large-scale, new build of public housing since that time. Despite the fact that the population has grown, there has not been an increase in public housing stock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just in my electorate of Melbourne—although I see it there most acutely, because I spend a lot of time in public housing, and we've got the most in the country, according to the last stats I've seen. It is happening right around the country. All state governments, whether they're Labor or Liberal, are not building enough public housing, and the federal government has taken its eye off the ball there as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that if you don't build enough public housing then there's not enough supply at the bottom end, of cheap rents, and it allows the rent for everything else to get pushed up. So if we wanted to put a roof over people's heads, and if we wanted to bring down the cost of renting to a level where it was affordable, and if we wanted to start taking the heat out of house prices, one simple solution would be to go back to what governments used to do and build more public housing. That's not because everyone who needs an affordable home would go and move into public housing, but if you built a lot of public housing then you'd take a lot of people out of the bottom end of the market, you'd lower rents proportionally, and then the rents everywhere else would fall as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So one of the first things that we need to do is to get back to basics and say that one of the things that governments should be for is making sure everyone's got a roof over their head. If we looked at housing in the same way that we look at schools, governments would be building more public housing, and we would not see the situation that we have in my home state of Victoria. There we saw the Liberals try and sell off the existing public housing. Now Labor is trying to do the same; instead of building more, they're trying to flog it off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get back to thinking about public housing as a community good. Then what we could do is to use some of those billions that are going to negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions—tax breaks for the very wealthy—to also build another layer of affordable housing. And there are some really good ideas out there. Some people have said, 'Why not look at our super funds'—which I think have $2 trillion under their control; I stand to be corrected, but it is something like that. Why not say, 'Let's work out a way of getting all that money'—which, in fact, is guaranteed savings for them, because, by legislation, employers have to put money into there—'and find a way of giving super funds, for example, the right to build and buy properties that are just built to be rented out at below market rates.' So why don't we do that? Why don't we start actually building some infrastructure here, using some of the savings that we have in Australia, to build or rent things out at below market rates?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear someone from the Labor side laughing as I suggest that, and I remind them that that was actually something that was on the books, in my suburb of Kensington, under a Labor government; they were talking about building one of the new housing developments and selling off some of it for key workers who work in the city but who just can't afford to live near the city. So you might build some new housing developments and either rent them out or sell them at affordable rates, so that the people who come in and clean in the CBD offices don't have to spend all their money on petrol and car parking to get into the city but might actually be able to live near the city, or so that the essential service workers who service the city could come and live near the city as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are some good ideas out there. If we built a lot more public housing, and also encouraged a lot more affordable housing, we could do it. But it takes a bit of guts. It takes a bit of guts to stand up and say, 'We need things like rent control.' We need things like governments actually being prepared to borrow to fund the infrastructure that we need to make sure everyone has got an affordable roof over their head. And it means saying that it might be time for the federal government to reconsider its role in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We went to the last election, as we have gone to elections before, saying it's time to start pooling some of the government money, taking it out of the tax breaks that we're currently giving from capital gains tax and negative gearing. Let's take that money and instead put it into a new housing trust or an affordable housing corporation that would allow for the massive expansion of public housing and affordable housing around this country. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery so it's no surprise that a government bereft of ideas of its own has seen the idea of an affordable housing corporation and picked it up and tried to appropriate it. But as is always the way with this government, it's more the veneer of being seen to be doing something rather than actually doing something itself because the amount of money that the government is proposing to put into this, on current reading, still isn't going to touch the sides. We are still going to see young people unable to buy their own home, we are still going to see public housing waiting lists in the tens of thousands and we're still going to see people continuing to remain homeless. When you have a situation where housing services say that they're turning away 50 per cent of the people who come to them seeking help because the services don't have the money to deal with them, you understand the scale of the problem that we are dealing with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to this bill being scrutinised as it goes through the Senate because there are a lot of questions to be answered as to whether it's going to do anything useful or whether it has the appearance of doing something useful. The government does have form in picking up ideas that are good ideas and trying to put them into practice. But at the end of the day, the test has to be this: do we think it's right in this country that, going back to the 1990s, a house cost on average six times a young person's income but fast forward a couple of decades and it now costs 12 times an average young person's income? That's the situation we have at the moment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear that this government's attempt to be seen to be doing something about housing is not going to fix the problem because the pea under the mattress in all of this is that our tax system pushes up house prices. As long as we have unfair tax breaks in the form of negative gearing and capital gains tax, then the government might be pushing very gently with one hand against house prices but, with the other hand, they're lifting up house prices by allowing negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions to remain in the budget. The government will be wasting money if they don't tackle the big problem and the big problem is our tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another big problem is government mentality and unwillingness to build the housing that we need. We need to start saying in this country that housing isn't to be treated like another asset like shares, housing isn't something to be invested in—and I know some members of parliament on the government side have over a dozen investment properties themselves—housing isn't something to be treated like an asset class, but that housing is a human right. And until every person in this country has an affordable house, whether renting or buying, we've failed. So I'd urge the government, as this bill progresses through the parliament, to listen to the recommendations that might come from the Senate inquiry but also to stop backing in their rich mates and to finally get rid of those negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions that are working against first home buyers and making their lives a misery.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  Firstly I thank all members who have contributed to this debate. The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018 and the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 deliver an important part of the government's comprehensive housing affordability plan by establishing a new independent corporate Commonwealth entity, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, to strengthen efforts to improve housing outcomes for all Australians. It's clear—and has been remarked upon by many members on both side—that housing is critical to the social and economic wellbeing of Australians and the economy as a whole. It can impact on employment, education and health outcomes, and is a significant driver of investment, productivity and participation. However, housing affordability is a complex and multifaceted issue which requires a comprehensive understanding of the different parts of the housing market and the underlying drivers impacting upon housing affordability. While land supply is primarily a state responsibility, the government recognises that housing supply has not kept up with demand, particularly in major metropolitan areas, and this has contributed to sustained increases in housing prices. For example, for first home buyers the number of years needed to save a 20 per cent deposit for a home in Sydney or Melbourne has increased by more than 60 per cent over just the past decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing affordability is also impacting upon the most vulnerable. Despite significant Commonwealth expenditure on housing, totalling $7.6 billion in 2016-17 comprising $4.4 billion in Commonwealth rental assistance and $3.2 billion in housing and homelessness funding, housing outcomes have not improved. For example, the COAG performance report dashboard shows that very little progress has been made on the benchmark in the National Affordable Housing Agreement to reduce by 10 per cent the proportion of low-income households experiencing rental stress. In addition, waiting lists have increased, with around 40,000 Australians currently on waiting lists for community housing and an additional 148,000 on public housing waiting lists. The challenge of being unable to access secure and affordable housing has flow-on effects for the functioning of communities. Housing unaffordability has resulted in key workers such as police officers and teachers being unable to afford to live near police stations and schools and participate in the communities in which they serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there's no simple solution to the complex problem of housing affordability, these bills are one element of the government's comprehensive package that seeks to improve housing outcomes across the housing spectrum. The plan to reduce pressure on housing affordability is focused on three key pillars: firstly, boosting the supply of housing and encouraging a more responsive housing market; secondly, creating the right financial incentives to improve housing outcomes for first home buyers and low-to middle-income Australians; and thirdly, improving outcomes in social housing and addressing homelessness. These bills establish the corporation and its governing independent skills based board to enable it to administer the $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility and an affordable housing bond aggregator. The infrastructure facility will help finance the critical infrastructure needed to unlock and accelerate new housing supply, particularly affordable housing. The financial assistance available will encourage and complement private sector and state and local government investment and facilitate the delivery of critical housing related infrastructure that otherwise would not be built, or not for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government anticipates that the infrastructure facility could also support the development of mixed tenure projects, a combination of affordable and private housing that provide broader community benefits, including housing, that enable key workers to live near the places where they work. The infrastructure facility could assist this nascent sector to develop further and to leverage other sources of finance, such as superannuation funds. The government has committed $1 billion which may be distributed by the infrastructure facility in the form of up to $175 million in grants, with the remaining balance being used to provide loans and other investments. Eligible infrastructure projects include transport links, power and water infrastructure, and site remediation works. State, territory and local government owned corporations, utility providers and, importantly, registered community housing providers will be eligible to apply for these funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The corporation will also need to ensure it funds projects that satisfy the appropriate regulatory and environmental standards. It's our view that the infrastructure facility will grow over time as the corporation reinvests the capital and earnings gained through the infrastructure facility. An important feature of the facility is that it will tailor its provision of finance to best suit the needs of individual projects, with many concessions calibrated to the particular circumstances of the project and limited to the minimum amount of assistance required to enable a proposal to proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of the bond aggregator, this will improve the efficiency of financing for community housing providers through the provision of cheaper and longer term loans, enabling those providers to improve housing outcomes for existing clients and potentially build scale by providing services to new clients. Community housing providers offer support for our most vulnerable through the provision of housing to those on very low to moderate incomes or those with unique or additional needs. The finance offered will be tailored to the needs of those community housing providers and funded through the issue of bonds, backed, importantly and quite celebrated in the sector, by a legislative guarantee which will drive the best price outcome for providers. Institutional investors will also benefit as they've expressed a clear appetite for social impact investments, which help to deliver better outcomes to the community at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The details of the infrastructure facility and bond aggregator are to be contained in the investment mandate to be issued under the bill. In line with the practices of other Commonwealth corporate entities recently established, the government will outline its expectations of the corporation in the investment mandate, but it will not be able to direct the corporation in relation to particular loans, investments or grants in relation to specific projects. Providing the particulars of the corporation's activities in the investment mandate rather than the bill allows the legislative framework to be flexible and nimble to adjust to the needs of the community housing providers as and when that occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key design feature is the corporation's independence from government. All financing and investment will be made by the corporation's independent skills based board. The independent board will be comprised of experts from a range of fields, including banking and finance, social and affordable housing, and infrastructure planning and financing, to ensure that decisions are sound and commercially based. Independence of the board's decision-making will cultivate credibility, we hope, in financial markets and will provide the board with the flexibility to perform its functions effectively and efficiently and tailor finance to the needs of recipients, being mindful of the risks involved. The experience of the Housing Affordability Fund underlined the importance of the independent decision-making. Indeed, the Australian National Audit Office noted that there were serious shortcomings in the administration of the Housing Affordability Fund and that some proposals that were approved were not selected on a merit basis or in accordance with established guidelines. We don't want to make those same mistakes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An important feature of the primary bill is that it provides a legislative guarantee for the corporation's liabilities for at least five years of the corporation's operation. This bill provides for the guarantee to be potentially withdrawn in future if it's deemed to be no longer required. This would be dependent on both the corporation achieving sufficient maturity in scale and the community housing sector taking on a larger scale and more prominent role in submarket rental housing, including, importantly, through partnerships with the private sector and, of course, institutional investors. To provide certainty to investors, it may only be withdrawn by the government on a prospective basis after 1 July 2023 and with at least 60 days notice. The availability of the guarantee will therefore strengthen market confidence and improve the corporation's ability to achieve its underlying purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the medium to long term, the corporation is intended to be financially self-sustaining, which means it won't require ongoing support through the budget. The corporation's profits and funds returned from its investments will be available for reinvestment. In time, the corporation may accumulate surplus funds and be in a position to return a dividend to the Commonwealth. Importantly, there will also be a review of the operation of the bill after three years of its commencement to assess if the corporation is delivering the intended benefits that we all hope it will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passage of the bills during the current sitting period will facilitate the necessary preparations to enable the corporation to undertake its infrastructure facility and bond aggregator from 1 July 2018. The associated consequential amendments and transitional provisions allow the entity to be established before it starts making investment decisions on 1 July 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The associated National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, I should note, to exempt the corporation from the requirement to provide a statement setting out the findings and reasons for any decisions relating to its activities where requested—for example, by an unsuccessful applicant. This exemption ensures the efficient administration of the corporation and is consistent with previous exemptions provided to similar bodies, most notably the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, that bill also amends schedule 2 of the Freedom of Information Act to exempt the corporation from the requirements of that act in relation to documents pertaining to any of its commercial activities. This exemption applies to the commercial activities, again, of other similar entities, such as the NBN Co and Indigenous Business Australia, and is consistent in those terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I therefore thank all members who have contributed to this debate and commend these bills to the House.</span>
                </p>
