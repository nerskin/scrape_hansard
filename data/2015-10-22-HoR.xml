                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:01</span>):  I have a short statement on procedure. I inform the House that the Department of the House of Representatives will work with the Department of Parliamentary Services to develop an electronic petitions website and system for the House. This follows the recent government response to the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Petitions that the House establish an electronic petitions website and system under the administration of the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I anticipate that the electronic petition system will be available early in the new year. The work will be done within existing resources and will involve consultation with the petitions committee and the secretariat to ensure that the system meets requirements. Once the system is developed, I will update the House. The House will need to consider amendments to the standing orders to establish an e-petitions system for the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding Torrens to Table B will address this inequity. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will mean this promising university is eligible to receive research block grant funding. The funding includes tuition fee support for PhD and masters research students, and funding for research scholarships including the Australian postgraduate awards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure advances a fair and competitive university research system and supports greater access and opportunity for students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the previous measure to extend access to HELP for certain New Zealand citizens, this measure is only necessary because the opposition failed to support the government's higher education reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those reforms contained measures to ensure the minister could extend access to such programs beyond those institutions listed on tables A and B. This would have made it possible to extend research funding eligibility to Torrens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another measure previously presented to this parliament, but rejected by the opposition, is schedule 3. This schedule amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to reflect the change of the name of the University of Ballarat to the Federation University Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This name change took place in mid-2013 and the new name took effect on 1 January 2014. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment to the act serves simply to update the list of 'table A' providers to reflect the new name.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 inserts a provision that confirms the relevant heads of constitutional power that part 2-3 (other grants) of the Higher Education Support Act 2003<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>relies on, in addition to the effect that part 2-3 otherwise has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure makes the constitutional head of power for these grants clear and provides the confidence and assurance to our universities and their students that Commonwealth support for university research can be maintained.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to streamline and clarify the reporting responsibilities of TEQSA following the passage of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It removes the requirement for the Commissioner of TEQSA to prepare annual operational plans, as the PGPA Act now requires commissioners to prepare and publish a corporate plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the annual and corporate plans cover the same material, this measure removes duplication and reduces regulatory burden, in line with the government's broader agenda to cut unnecessary red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, it means TEQSA is able to direct more of its resources to supporting high-quality higher education and less to unnecessary paperwork.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the amendment revises the day by which TEQSA must provide its corporate plan from 31 January to 30 April. This provides commissioners sufficient time to prepare the plan in alignment with the relevant portfolio budget statements, whilst ensuring the minister may properly consider the plan prior to its commencement on 1 July each year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 increases the funding caps in the Australian Research Council Act 2001<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>in line with inflation and ensures that the government can continue to provide support for thousands of research projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Research Council (or ARC) invests in excellent fundamental and applied research that helps improve the quality of people's lives, that supports Australian businesses and that ensures our nation remains at the cutting edge of research, innovation and global competitiveness. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, earlier this week, the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, and the Minister for Health and Minister for Aged Care, Sussan Ley, announced 76 researchers would share in $43 million in joint ARC and National Health and Medical Research Council funding to tackle the impacts of, and to find ways of preventing and curing, dementia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of the coalition government's $200 million election commitment to dementia research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ARC is the most significant single source of competitive funding in Australia for research across all disciplines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill to extend funding through to 2018-19 provide certainty that Australian researchers will continue to have access to critically important taxpayer funding for their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also remove the specific provisions contained in the act requiring the development of an annual corporate plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with the TEQSA amendment, this will reduce duplication of effort and resources, while ensuring the ARC, like all other Commonwealth departments and agencies, remains accountable through the PGPA Act<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>which requires the development of an annual corporate plan.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:14</span>):  Last night I thought I would have the opportunity to get up and speak in this debate on the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015, but I did not. But I did get the chance to hear from other participants. There have been a number of people who have participated so far in this debate, and I have to say that I am very disappointed that government members—backbenchers and ministers—have not apologised to people on this side of the House. They have not apologised to the Leader of the Opposition, they have not apologised to the union movement and they have not apologised to the many, many working people who have raised legitimate concerns about this agreement and the impact that it will have on local jobs. I call on them to apologise because they are the people who stood up time and time again in this parliament and in the public arena and made accusations against people for calling for safeguards to protect Australian jobs. They accused us of xenophobia. They accused us of racism. Yet what we saw yesterday and what we see today is the government agreeing to sensible safeguards to protect Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It needs to be said loud and clear that if you stand up to protect Australian jobs it is not racism, it is not xenophobia. That is just the government's scaremongering, and it is good to see that they are starting to back down on that rhetoric because that rhetoric is dangerous for two reasons. The first is that it diminishes the genuine racism and xenophobia that is going on in our community. It is the case in Australia at the moment that we have to tackle racism and bigotry head-on. We should not be using it as a throwaway remark to scare people in a debate that, at the heart of it, is about jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am glad the government has agreed to Labor's amendments. This will ensure that this legislation goes through with safeguards in place to protect Australian jobs. The government also has not been truly honest with the Australian people about how many jobs this agreement will create. They like to throw around the word 'jobs'—it is going to create 'jobs'—and they continue to say that word. But what we have discovered, and what the evidence is saying, is that it will create some jobs but not the hundreds of thousands that this government is claiming. The minister and the members of the backbench are out there saying, 'This agreement will create hundreds of thousands of jobs.' That is simply not true. At least be honest with the Australian people about how many jobs this agreement will create. The minister, in the other place, has already been forced to back down and correct the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. What she claimed was that these three free trade agreements combined would create 178,000 jobs. It is not true, and the minister has, to her credit, corrected the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record. On Tuesday, 13 October, she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have since been advised that the methodology was inaccurate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can we really trust a government that cannot even get something as simple as that right? How inaccurate was it? They misread the table. They added up every year to come to that bogus figure of 178,000 jobs. What they did not do was read the paragraph up the top of the table that said that in 2020 there would be 14,566 more jobs if the FTAs were implemented compared to what would have been the case if they were not. That is all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just put that figure into context. This government has already sacked 16,000 public servants. Last month alone 13,000 full-time jobs were lost. For all the rhetoric saying that these free trade agreements will be the silver bullet to create jobs in this country, it has turned out to be nothing more than an overinflated, ambitious claim by this government. There is to be 14,566 more jobs by 2020. To put that into context, this government has already sacked 16,000 public servants, and last month's figures alone show that 13,000 full-time jobs were lost. What we do not know is what kind of jobs these agreements will create—full-time jobs or part-time jobs. What we also do not know is who will work these jobs, which is why these safeguards were so critical. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear time and time again how critical this agreement is for industries that this government is the champion of. This includes agriculture, and it is a good deal for agriculture—for the businesses in agriculture, for the people who might make profits in agriculture. But without Labor's amendments there was no guarantee that regional Australians would share in that opportunity and that they would get the jobs. Right now, who works in agriculture in the dairy industry? There are 40,000 people working in dairy, yet dairy is now on the 457 visa list. Dairy relies on overseas temporary workers. In the agriculture industry, horticulture relies on overseas temporary workers. The beef industry, the food processing industry and the seafood industry—all the industries that this government says will benefit from these agreements, and they will—rely on overseas workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this government was not willing to put the safeguards in place to ensure (1) that those overseas workers were paid Australian wages and conditions, (2) that they would be protected from exploitation and (3) that we would only go to an overseas worker if there was not a local worker available. Labor's amendments ensure we have the safeguards in place so that locals can get the opportunity of these agreements. Labor's amendments ensure that people in Australian jobs are protected and that Australian people will get the first chance at these jobs that are created in the agriculture industry and the financial services industry across our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government does not care about local people and giving them the opportunities. If they were serious about creating jobs in our economy, they would have had these safeguards in the beginning. They would have listened to the concerns of the union movement and listened to the concerns of the Labor Party and they would not have stood up here in question time and accused us of some quite shocking things which just simply were not true. Labor's agreement around safeguards will ensure that there is labour market testing. A new legal requirement in the Migration Regulations will require labour market testing for all work agreements. So this is not just good for this free trade deal; it is good for all the deals. People need to know that if there is a skills shortage it is a genuine one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Weekly, if not daily, we hear reports in the media about worker exploitation. The Fair Work Ombudsman is working overtime to ensure that we are prosecuting exploitation. We need to ensure first and foremost that, if there is a local job created, it gets offered to a local worker first. Labor's safeguards will also uphold Australian pay and conditions, through a better wage system for 457 visa workers. How? A new legal requirement that the market salary for a standard 457 visa holder will be used in enterprise agreement rates as the salary benchmark. That is critical to ensure that workers in similar industries are being paid the Australian rate of pay, not some made-up rate of pay with the award at a minimum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also ensure through the safeguards that the temporary skilled migration income threshold is to be reviewed to make sure it is in line and it is a benchmark. What will also be required as a result of Labor's safeguard amendments, which the government has agreed to, is the maintenance of Australian skills and safety standards, to ensure foreign workers have the relevant licence under Australian law. This is critical. All of you in your offices would have seen the letter that was signed by the Minister for Trade and Investment that declared the industries where the skill assessment would be waived. It was doing the rounds of social media and it created a lot of anxiety within the community. But now the government has agreed to Labor's amendment which will ensure a new legal requirement that 457 visa holders in the trade occupations must obtain a licence within 90 days of arriving here on that visa, will not work without holding the licence and will notify the department of immigration if a licence is refused or revoked. These conditions will be written into the migration regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the critical safeguards that Australians wanted to see to ensure that, when you work in the trades in Australia, you have an Australian qualification. When somebody comes here as a 457 visa worker, they will be required now to demonstrate that they have those skills. Australia has some of the best safety records in the world, some of the safest workplaces, and our tradespeople work really hard to get their qualifications. It is wrong to have a situation where someone from overseas can come in and not be required to meet that same bar. These safeguards ensure that that situation will not now happen. That is why this government needs to be really honest. It is great that it has finally, after month and months, understood the concerns of the Australian people, the concerns of the union movement and what we have been saying from the Australian Labor Party. There is no point to a free trade agreement with any country if it does not deliver for all Australians. The free trade agreement should not just be about profits and about ensuring exporters get a better deal when their product goes into China. It should also be about spreading that goodwill, that opportunity, to all Australians. Without these safeguards in place that the government has agreed to, we could not guarantee that that would happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, which is a regional electorate, this has been an issue where the government divided the community—winemaker and farmer versus the tradies. It divided the community because one group was saying, 'Why should someone come here and work in our industry without having my qualification?' and on the other end the government was saying to the farmers, 'You've got to back this deal in because it is going to be good for tariffs.' That is what this government did. What we have been able to do, because the government has agreed to our amendments, is bridge that so now the tradies are safe and our winemakers and our farmers will actually benefit from the changes that we have got going forward. I am glad the government has seen the error of its ways and has agreed to Labor's amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:26</span>):  It is a brand-new day, full of delicious possibilities—and they have got better. Those possibilities for our nation, for our small businesses, for men and women looking to pursue economic opportunities, have got better because today we will be passing the ChAFTA legislation: the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. This is the legislation that will bring into law the changes to the excise and tariff regimes negotiated skilfully and with great wisdom by the free trade grasshopper, the wise one, Andrew Robb, who now has the quadrella. The wise one has worked his way through the North Asia free trade agreements. He has now got the TPP underway. I would like to add one more. We need to get an agreement quickly with Hong Kong to complement the ChAFTA, because, for many Australian businesses, entry into the Chinese market is a wonderful opportunity, but the sort of expertise and capital to deal with this vast market may well be accelerated and supported by a very close economic relationship with Hong Kong. I was pleased to talk with some of their ministers in my previous role, from my previous vantage point in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But today is a great day. Never before has there been such a great opportunity to expand markets. Those of us who have any feel for business know that there is no substitute for customers. You can have the greatest business plan, the greatest ideas, the greatest team, but if no-one is buying your goods or services or taking advantage of your know-how or seeking to include your input in their goals then that great business model will not achieve its potential. What it needs is customers, and this agreement—in fact all the North Asia trade agreements—opens the door to new markets of over 1½ billion people. This puts our home-grown businesses in the box seat to take advantage of these market opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Never before has there been a better chance for us to showcase the array of excellence in our economy: our world-class food; our wines; our boutique beers—and I know Mornington Peninsula Brewery is leading the charge in that respect; our products; and our know-how, where China are looking to take advantage of and engage our knowledge, our systems, our wisdom and our experience to improve economic outcomes for themselves, which, in turn, will improve economic outcomes for our economy. Services is a wonderful story—70 per cent of our domestic economy but only 17 per cent of our export income. There is enormous growth potential. That door has been opened wide, giving us the inside running to take advantage of these new markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to realise that the vast majority of exporters are actually small and medium enterprises. Ninety per cent of all of our exporters are SMEs. That is by number, but by value their contribution is only around five per cent of our export earnings, so again there is an enormous opportunity there to increase the engagement of SMEs in these economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is terrific is that we are talking about a China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and having it passed in this place and having it not changed one dot. It has not changed at all. For all of those robocalls that the union put into my electorate, which caused great concern and fear amongst my constituents, I was happy to respond to with some factual information of—newsflash—this agreement has not been changed. The agreement stays as it was. So all of the fearmongering and race based condemnation of a wonderful market opportunity for our country proved to be nothing. It was a mountain of noise with no content. This agreement will pass this parliament unchanged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is interesting though is that we have just heard the member for Bendigo give a quite passionate condemnation of her own colleague the member for Gorton. Why was the member for Gorton so derelict in his responsibilities when he was the migration minister? He put in place all of the regime around market testing and benchmarking against Australian wages. He had all of that validated by procedure and policy, by systems and requirements. That seemed perfectly satisfactory to Labor when they were in office but now, when they are in opposition, these are an abomination, these are malfeasants, this is a poor effort to bring into effect the migration system that supports the movement of labour and skills to make sure our economic potential and our economy is met. So what we have seen is the government agreeing to codify, pretty much, what was put in place by the member for Gorton, which has been roundly condemned by his own party. That is interesting. It will be interesting at the O'Connor family Christmas dinner as the conversations play out between brothers about how all this works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing to focus on is that this is a wonderful opportunity for our economy. I will explain this simply for the member for Bendigo, who could not quite see how trade equals jobs. Trade equals new markets and new investment. Those new markets and those new investments lead to increased economic activity. The horsepower, the skills, the wisdom, the knowledge and the talents to take advantage of that economic activity and give it meaning and turn it into higher incomes and prosperity for the future are jobs. That is people, that is improved prospects for livelihoods and better incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much more I would like to say, but I am keen for my colleagues to also have the opportunity to contribute to a great success today. What I would say to Australian men and women of small business and family enterprises is: engage with this opportunity. We have a better opportunity than any other country at this time. The door is open for us. We can get into that market first. Those opportunities are not reserved for us. We need to make them our own. We need to grab those opportunities. This is no summer romance. It is not a matter of spending a few weeks in China in the sun and going home with happy experiences, smiles and suntans. There are no walk-up markets and customers waiting for us. We have to win those opportunities. That is why the rest of the government's economic reform agenda is so important. That is why our mission to energise enterprise is at the heart of turning this outstanding diplomatic trade negotiation agreement into better outcomes for our economy and our citizens. I reckon enterprising men and women are up for that challenge. Great potential is within their reach.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  On 17 June 2015, and to much fanfare, the coalition government signed the free trade agreement with China. Whilst I acknowledge the agreement will deliver significant benefits to Australian exporters and consumers, I am sure the government could have secured a better deal, particularly when it came to protecting Australian jobs. In fact, the deal signed off by the Liberals flies in the face of what we would normally consider to be the benefits of a free trade agreement. For most of us trade is the cornerstone to economic growth and also to job creation and, for our benefit, Australian jobs. On face value the government's deal, not only could put employment opportunities for Australian workers in jeopardy, but there is a real risk of undermining workplace standards while offering an open-door policy to temporary overseas workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, the government agreed to an investment facilitation agreement, which is a provision that allows Chinese investors, in projects valued at over $150 million, additional rights to bring in temporary migrant workers under Australian migration programs without giving preference to Australians. Specifically, the agreement says that entry and temporary stay for foreign workers can be granted for up to four years and possibly longer for contractual services supplied from China. While the government claims very much to the contrary, the fact is that the agreement clearly states that Australia will not impose or maintain any limitations on the total number of visas to be granted or require labour-market testing, economic-need testing or other procedures of similar effect as a condition for temporary entry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a similar vein, the Liberal government also agreed to an investor-state dispute settlement provision, which is a provision that Labor has always said it would never include in a free trade agreement or treaty, given particularly the implications that arise in implementing domestic legislation or ongoing legal implications for both state and federal governments and government owned enterprises. Having said that, Labor has always recognised the significant economic position arising from a free trade agreement with China. Providing improved access to Chinese markets for exporters, particularly in agriculture, mining, resources, manufacturing and services is, unquestionably, a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While China is already our largest trading partner, I acknowledge that the free trade agreement will enhance our economic relationship with China. While there is bipartisan support for a free trade agreement with China, the reality is that bipartisan support for ChAFTA has only occurred following Labor's successful negotiation in implementing a number of amendments to underpinning provisions to tackle what we believe to be significant shortcomings and, importantly, providing appropriate safeguards for Australian jobs, wages, workplace skills and safety standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This could have and should have occurred earlier but for the government's intractable position. The safeguards negotiated and now agreed to will significantly improve the free trade agreement with China. The safeguards will, firstly, require labour market testing for all work agreements; secondly, require a market salary rate for standard 457 visas to use and require 457 visas to reference enterprise agreement rates where they exist, in respect to wages benchmarks; and, thirdly, require the implementation of more stringent visa conditions for 457 workers in trade occupations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are good things and these are things that will certainly create a greater degree of confidence in entering into a free trade arrangement with China. There is no doubt these safeguards will support employment opportunities for Australian workers by requiring prospective employers to demonstrate a skills shortage and genuine need to access temporary skilled migration, as jobs cannot be filled by local workers. With the changes proposed to regulations under the Migration Act, it will require the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection to have regard to whether the work agreements entered into will support or create jobs for Australian jobs down the track. In doing so, the minister will also have the power to impose additional conditions in these agreements to ensure they have a positive impact on Australian jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area of significant concern about the free trade agreement with China is the specific removal of mandatory skills assessments for Chinese workers in various trades, including carpenters, mechanics and electricians. Mandatory skills assessments are used to determine whether a worker has the necessary skills and experience to work in particular occupations in Australia. Through Labor's efforts, an agreement has now been reached providing for a new visa condition for workers on 457 visas, which will require the evidence of occupational licenses within 90 days to ensure that applicants possess the requisite skills and experience. Alongside that, Labor has also negotiated the appropriate indexation of the temporary skilled migration income thresholds. These changes will all benefit the appropriate consideration of temporary workers coming into the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that, in its current form, the provisions of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement would not have been signed off by the Labor Party. However, Labor is determined to expand and deepen our economic relationship with China, we are determined to create more opportunities for Australia for now and into the future and we are determined to ensure that the benefits of trade flow to our communities in the form of higher growth, more jobs and better living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that respect, I believe that the Labor provisions negotiated with the government are not only complementary to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement but also significantly enhances its operations. But importantly, these changes will address real concerns held by the community, particularly in respect to Australian jobs. Having said that, I support the passage of this Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015.</span>

                    <a href="WN6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IAN MACFARLANE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:40</span>):  I thank the member for Fowler and the members on both sides of this chamber for their comments in relation to this Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb. He has done an extraordinary job on this free trade agreement, as he has done on the three previous free trade agreements that he has negotiated. He is someone who will leave a legacy in this place that will be indelible. I also thank Senator Wong for her cooperation and negotiation in the deliberations. I have had negotiations in previous lives with Senator Wong, and she is a fair but hard negotiator. It is no surprise to me that she has brought about a compromise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the statistics and the opportunities in relation to this free trade agreement. Thousands, tens of thousands and, in time, hundreds of thousands of jobs will come from this monumental agreement for the Australian people that we represent. We all come to this place to make Australia a better place. We do not always agree on how we should do that, but we come with that as our basic instinct as we enter this House and this parliament. This is an agreement that will create jobs right across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My passion has always been regional Australia. I represent the largest inland provincial city in Australia and the rich agricultural area that surrounds that city. When I look at this free trade agreement, I see the gains in dairy, beef, horticulture and even sheepmeat; we have a few sheep farmers and feedlots in my electorate. Then I look at the resources sector, which I was so proud to represent for so long. I look at the coal industry, the oil and gas industry, the copper industry, the lead industry, the zinc industry, the aluminium ore industry, the alumina industry and the lead industry. The things that have made regional Australia great, like agriculture and mining, are the big beneficiaries out of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is much more, because there is the produce that flows from those regions—particularly the agricultural produce—that is then processed here in Australia and exported to China, which is a market that is hungry for high quality, clean and reliable product. It is there for the taking, so this free trade agreement offers those opportunities. I have two major abattoirs in my region. I have third that is under consideration and potentially a fourth. They are all looking to China for opportunities. I have the most recent and first privately built airport in my electorate, which is soon to have 747 access direct to China. As a result, we will see our region—my electorate—really pick up and prosper from the things that this free trade agreement will deliver for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as jobs, there will be confidence: confidence that you can make an investment in Australia and hook into what is an enormous supply chain of customers waiting for your product. There is a lot to be gained from this for Australia and there is a lot to be gained from this for China. It continues that long relationship we have had with China where we do things that are mutually beneficial for both countries; but there are some great benefits in this for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like, in the short time that I have, to draw people's attention to some of the quotes that have been made by people who represent industries in my electorate or in the resource sector as a whole. Cotton Australia says that the agreement would 'deliver important tariff cuts that would greatly benefit cotton growers and the communities'. For my cotton growers out in the Brookstead plain and to the west of Toowoomba, it is another great opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lance Hockridge of Aurizon says that for the coal producers—and I have a coalmine in my electorate—the ChAFTA will bring 'much needed relief to the Australian coal sector by eliminating Chinese import tariffs on Australian coal'. As a minister, I held discussions with Chinese ministers to try and bring that about. The Minister for Trade and Investment has delivered on that in spades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an old executive member of the National Farmers' Federation, I am very pleased to see the opportunities that come from this. Their President, Brent Finlay, said that any delay in the ratification of this agreement would cost potentially $100 million for the beef industry, $60 million for the dairy industry, $50 million for the wine industry and $43 million for the grain industry. The list just goes on and on. All those gains will now be realised as a result of the passage of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at the resource industry and the big exporters like the iron ore industry, Nev Power from Fortescue Metals said the China-Australia FTA is 'an important plank in encouraging business investment and the jobs and the community development that will follow'. Anyone who thinks that this free trade agreement is in any way detrimental to jobs does not have a realistic understanding of what this will create for us. It will create, as I say, thousands, tens of thousands and, in time, hundreds of thousands of jobs based on investment, based on sales from Australia to China and based on the development of more industries and highly sophisticated industries. That is an opportunity that we need to grab with both hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Mackenzie of BHP Billiton said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a nation we rely on access to foreign markets to grow our economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not a truer word was ever spoken. Whether it is in agriculture or in resources, we are a country that produces far more than we will ever consume with our modest population. As someone who has been a farmer for much longer than a politician, can I tell you we produce about four times as much as we consume at the moment, with the potential to even increase that. Markets like China and the other countries covered by free trade agreements are countries we need to look to to grow our customer base. That was highlighted by Mr Takahashi, Chairman of Mitsui Australia, when he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has been offered a unique competitive opportunity through the China Free Trade Agreement that it should not miss … It is an important fact that China has not made agreements with any other countries that compete with Australia in beef or iron ore or raw materials and other things like that—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">to the standard of this free trade agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The closing quote I would like to use is from Mike Smith, the CEO of the ANZ Bank. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To be clear: this agreement means more to Australia's future than any other of our Free Trade Agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That really says it all. This is an enormous opportunity for Australia. It is an opportunity that I know, having grown up in regional Australia, having represented regional Australia in this House for 17 years, regional Australia will grab with both hands and continue to build this nation into the unique and great nation that it will be in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I have a reasonable familiarity with the terms of ChAFTA and contributed to the dissenting report by Labor members that was tabled along with the report of the majority of the committee on Monday. I certainly support the amendments that are being debated here today, as they improve aspects of the operation of the agreement with respect to the necessity of labour market testing in relation to IFAs granted under the MOU with China. I remain concerned, however, about a number of aspects of ChAFTA that the amendments do not address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before talking about those matters, I note that there have been claims from the government that criticism of the agreement from the opposition, unions, academics and community groups are motivated by racism against China. Such claims are offensive. As my colleague the member for Wills detailed in his speech on the bill yesterday, this agreement goes further than any previous FTA in excluding labour market testing. There is also a distinct lack of balance in the agreement. As AFTINET's submission to the JSCOT inquiry notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Almost all Australian tariffs are reduced to zero, but Australia's market access to Chinese markets is much more limited, with selected gains for some farm products and service industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, an MOU accompanying the agreement provides that Australia will issue young Chinese with 5,000 work and holiday visas each year, but there is no reciprocal right for young Australians to work in China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Productivity Commission heavily criticised Australia's pursuit of FTAs in a 2010 report that recommended future agreements first undergo an independent cost-benefit analysis. The commission pointed to a lack of transparency and a lack of rigorous assessment of the provisions in recently signed agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to turn to some of my other concerns about the agreement—firstly, the removal of labour market testing under chapter 10 of the agreement itself. Without amending the text of the treaty, this aspect of the agreement remains problematic, as it prevents Australia from imposing a cap on the number of Chinese 457 visa holders. As Dr Joanna Howe has noted in her paper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The impact of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement on Australian job opportunities, wages and conditions</span>: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This means even if the Australian Government wished to constrain the number of 457 visa holders more generally because local unemployment was high or to reflect changing economic circumstances, it could not do so with respect to Chinese citizens … The absence of a cap means that Australians employers can engage unlimited numbers of Chinese citizens on 457 visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is completely contrary to the very purpose, the raison d'etre, of the 457 visa program, which is to meet skills shortages in the domestic labour market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> Secondly, it is clear that there is a lack of enforcement of requirements in the present temporary migration system, as evidenced in recent investigative reports by Monash University and ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> reports which have exposed the exploitation of temporary migrant workers in agriculture, food processing, 7-Eleven convenience stores and other industries. It is significant that the government majority report of JSCOT also noted this problem and made a recommendation that government boost resources to the department of immigration to enable appropriate oversight in this area. The fact that this has been necessary only highlights the deep flaws that already exist in the present system, without adding unlimited Chinese migrant workers to the mix. The potential for exploitation of these workers is a significant risk under ChAFTA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there is the issue of mandatory skills assessment. The side-letter to ChAFTA removes the requirement for mandatory skills assessment for Chinese workers in such trades as electricians, carpenters and mechanics. A number of my colleagues have canvassed this issue more widely, and I will leave it there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, as with our FTA with Korea, the ChAFTA also contains ISDS provisions, which constitute a fundamental derogation of a country's sovereignty. ISDS clauses allow foreign companies to sue governments in private international tribunals for laws, policies and court decisions impacting upon their profits—for instance, health, environmental and labour regulations; food labelling or quality and safety standards. The presence of an ISDS clause was why the former Labor government was not prepared to sign an FTA with Korea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Philip Morris tobacco company is using an ISDS clause in an obscure Hong Kong-Australia investment agreement to sue the Australian government in relation to our plain-packaging reforms, despite the laws having passed the parliament with bipartisan support and having been upheld in our own High Court. Even if Australia ultimately wins the case, it will have to pay its own legal costs of millions of dollars, that so far have amounted to $50 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians might be surprised to know that these cases are not heard by respected independent panels of judges but by panels of corporate lawyers who can be advocates for multinationals one day and panel members adjudicating cases the next. Their decisions are not transparent, they apply no precedent and they cannot be appealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Juan Fernandez-Armesto, an arbitrator from Spain made this observation: 'When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never ceases to amaze me that sovereign states have agreed to investment arbitration at all. Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restrictions or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chief Justice of the High Court, Robert French, gave a speech last year in which he raised concerns about ISDS and its implications for Australia's judicial system. He referred to the case of Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceutical giant that sued Canada under ISDS after the Canadian Supreme Court ruled two of its medicine patents invalid. The chief justice quoted Professor Brook Baker of Northeastern University law school's assessment of that case:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After losing two cases before the appellate courts of a western democracy should a disgruntled foreign multinational pharmaceutical company be free to take that country to private arbitration claiming that its expectation of monopoly profits had been thwarted by the court's decision? Should governments continue to negotiate treaty agreements where expansive intellectual property-related investor rights and investor-state dispute settlement are enshrined into hard law?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations Independent Expert Alfred de Zayas recently raised serious concerns about the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement clauses in free trade and investment agreements, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the light of widespread abuse over the past decades, the Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism, which accompanies most free trade and investment agreements must be abolished … because it encroaches on the regulatory space of States and suffers from fundamental flaws including lack of independence, transparency, accountability and predictability …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobel laureate for economics Professor Joseph Stiglitz has said this is a 'new private judicial system, only available to foreign corporations.' It is notable that ISDS may not be used by governments, civil society or domestic companies. I note that the Productivity Commission also raised ISDS as another reason why these agreements are of dubious benefit to nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some more recent trade agreements have attempted to improve ISDS processes. For instance, the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement requires ISDS hearings and documents to be made public. However, such improvements have not been included in ChAFTA. Moreover, important matters, such as the definition of indirect expropriation and the minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors, are not complete and have been delegated to a committee to review in three years time. The Labor members of the treaties committee noted that this foreshadowed future review may present an opportunity for wholesale revision of the ISDS mechanism under the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth, unlike KAFTA, ChAFTA does not contain chapters on labour and environment, which means neither government has made any commitments not to reduce labour rights or environmental standards, nor to implement ILO rights or international environmental agreements. AFTINET noted in its submission to JSCOT that China is listed as one of the world's 10 worst countries for labour rights. Recent strikes and protests by Chinese workers have been met with police repression. Violations occur not only in locally owned enterprises but in those under contract to global corporations like Apple and Walmart. Thus, it says, ChAFTA, in effect, 'rewards violations of labour and environmental standards by granting preferential market access to Australia' for goods produced under these conditions in China. And there is no mechanism to ensure that imported products are of an appropriate standard. The Australian Industry Group in October last year reported that a survey of its members found that many manufactured goods coming from China do not meet Australian safety and quality regulations, including dangerously faulty electrical cables which could have affected up to 40,000 homes and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth, given the recent imported frozen berries scandal, it is also extremely concerning that, while KAFTA excludes ISDS from application to such matters as the technical barriers to trade chapter which includes food labelling, ChAFTA does not. The DFAT officers at the JSCOT hearing stated that this was because in ChAFTA ISDS only applies to the investment chapter and not to any other chapter. I have not been able to verify that this is the case, but I certainly hope so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In sum, I support the amendments being introduced today that will improve the outcome for Australian workers, and I congratulate Labor's shadow ministers on this achievement. However, as I have set out, I have a number of concerns that remain, and I hope future Australian governments will ensure that there is an independent assessment of such agreements before they are entered into.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:58</span>):  I rise today to support the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. China of course is Australia's largest trading partner. It buys almost a third of all of our exports, valued at over $98 billion—or at least it did so in 2014—and is our top overseas market for agriculture, resources and services. China is set to remain our largest trading partner long into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will take this essential trade relationship to a new level. This is truly a landmark deal for this nation. Independent economic modelling shows that Australia's FTAs with China, Japan and Korea will together add $24.4 billion to the Australian economy over the coming 20 years. This agreement will deliver unprecedented market access for Australian businesses and producers into China, the most populous nation on Earth and the key driver of the global economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Barker in South-East South Australia is one of the most productive agricultural regions of Australia and one of the nation's most important food manufacturing electorates. This trade agreement will deliver a new era of prosperity, particularly for our agricultural and food manufacturing sectors. Few electorates are as well positioned as mine to take advantage of this deal. From the Limestone Coast in the south to the Riverland of the north, from the Barossa to the striking plains of the Murray lands and the Mallee, some of the best agricultural produce on earth is cultivated in Barker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already delivered constituents in Barker unprecedented market access to Japan and Korea, but now we have also delivered to them a world of opportunity in China. The coalition government pledged to open up Australia for business and today is a critical moment in that commitment. This bill delivers on that commitment. It is because of the actions that this government has taken that children in Shanghai will taste quality South Australian beef and lamb grown by livestock producers at Lucindale, Meningie and Lameroo. Because of the coalition, 12 to 25 per cent tariffs on beef will be eliminated within nine years and tariffs of between 12 and 23 per cent on sheep meat will be removed over seven years. Women in Beijing will wear garments made of the fine wool from the Mallee, where producers will receive an exclusive duty-free quota into China of 30,000 tonnes from day 1 of the agreement, growing to over 44,000 tonnes by 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the actions that the government has taken, the fine wines fermented from succulent wine grapes grown in the Barossa, Coonawarra, Padthaway and Riverland will adorn the tables of middle-class China. Tariffs of between 14 and 20 per cent on wine will be eliminated over four years. It is because of the actions that the government has taken that live southern rock lobster caught in the turquoise waters of Port Macdonnell, Robe, Beachport and Kingston will be consumed in Shenzhen and Nanjing. This will be the first time that these exports will be delivered officially or legally to these countries. There will no longer be the grey trade in that industry. Huge tariff reductions across other seafood sectors will deliver great gains for fishermen in Barker. Within four years, a 14 per cent tariff on abalone will be eliminated and a 12 per cent tariff on fish will be eliminated. It is because of this agreement that our fresh, clean and sustainable seafood industry will receive the shot in the arm it needs to level the playing field in the Chinese market for good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, fruit and vegetables grown on blocks along the Riverland will nourish the world's most populous nation. Measures this government is enacting will deliver enormous tariff reductions of up to 30 per cent. The horticultural sector is one of the biggest agrisectors in Barker and also one of the biggest winners in this agreement. Almond, walnut and pistachio orchardists will see tariffs eliminated over four years. I remind the House that the nut sector is the fastest-growing agricultural export sector in the country. Citrus, a key export from Barker, will see tariffs of 12 per cent reduced over eight years. ChAFTA not only will deliver economic prosperity but will deliver healthy food to millions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement will underpin long-term prosperity in the dairy sector. Tariffs of up to 20 per cent will be eliminated progressively. Milk from Australian cows will feed the next generation of Chinese children because of this government. Ice cream made from South Australian milk will ease hot and humid days in Bejing. Infant formula will be used by mothers across China, and cheese and butter produced with Australian milk will fill the fridges of millions because of this government's actions. It is because the government is acting in the best interests of our nation and not that of the unions that the forestry industry can be assured that we have locked in zero tariffs on Australian woodchips. Under ChAFTA, China's tariffs of up to 20 per cent on Australian forestry products made from radiata pine will be phased out over four years. This is a huge win for Barker, which of course is one of the nation's forestry hubs. I am proud to say that my constituents produce some of this nation's finest grains, vegetables, fruit, timber, meat and dairy. We have some of the finest wines and wine grapes in the world.</span>

                    </a>  I am glad the member for Wakefield and I agree on one thing. Yet it is simply not enough that we produce the best-quality produce if we do not have market access. For too long, the hardworking and industrious residents of the Barossa, the Riverland, the Mallee and the Murray land in the South-East have run into tariff barriers. For too long, unnecessary tariffs have halted economic development in this nation. For too long, tariffs stood as immovable barriers to the free flow of trade in our region. Well, I say: bring down that wall. Let the enterprise and industry of the residents of Barker be rewarded with the prosperity they so deserve. The government fundamentally values individual enterprise and it is time to obliterate the arbitrary constraints these tariff barriers have imposed on our agriculture and food manufacturing sectors. It is time for Australia's farmers and food manufacturers to seize the opportunities presented by the rise of China.</span>

I cannot think of a more transformative achievement for the constituents of Barker than the finalisation of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This is a deal that embraces the 21st century. I commend the efforts of the Minister for Trade on his industrious pursuit of better outcomes for all Australians. I encourage each and every Australian out there to make the most of the opportunities that this deal affords them. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and related bill. In doing so I would like to congratulate the shadow minister for trade and the Leader of the Opposition for the work that they have done in making this a piece of legislation that I can vote for. It is important to note that China is already Australia's No. 1 trading partner, and the legislation before us should see that relationship grow even stronger. This does deliver benefits to Australia. Consumers should see cheaper prices with the five per cent tariff on Chinese manufactured products, such as electronics and whitegoods, being phased out. Tariffs on various Australian commodities will be lowered and tariffs of between 13 to 14 per cent on various manufactured exports will be eliminated over four years. It also delivers benefits to the agriculture sector. It has a number of benefits in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that China would not have entered into a free trade agreement if it did not deliver significant benefits to China. Members on the government side of the House have not been particularly constructive in their approach to this legislation. Initially, there was hoo-ha from those on the other side of the House to the concerns we had about the impact it would have on Australian workers and their jobs. It was put to the people of Australia that our objections were not based on the desire to protect Australian jobs but rather on some form of racism. I find that abhorrent. I still have significant concerns about the way the legislation will impact on Australian workers and their jobs. But I have a Chinese daughter-in-law and I have extended family in China. I very much support a strong relationship between Australia and China, but I do not support the fact that Australian working conditions and jobs will be impacted upon by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with the changes and the agreements that have been reached by the shadow trade minister and the Leader of the Opposition I still have serious concerns. There were some concessions around labour market testing, and the amendments that we sought are now regulations. I hope that a future Labor government will revisit this and strengthen the agreement, because it is still quite weak in a number of areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area I have real concerns about is that of investor-state dispute settlements, ISDSs. We always have to protect our country, so any agreements entered into should not have these clauses included in them. Former Prime Minister John Howard would not enter into any agreements with ISDS clauses in them. When Labor was in government we did not enter into any agreements with ISDS clauses in them. Why? Because it allows companies to take the Australian government to public international courts to settle disputes. It jeopardises our sovereignty. Australia can be taken to an international court by a company. That is very visibly demonstrated at the moment, where Philip Morris has taken Australia to an international court over the legislation dealing with plain-packaging on cigarettes. It is putting the power of a company over and above the power of a nation. I do not think we in Australia should settle for that. It has the ability to impact on our right to protect our environment. It has the potential to impact on the safety and quality standard of goods coming into our country. This is a very important issue. It is one that is dear to the heart of many Australians. It is something that, once it is included in an agreement like this, has the effect of impinging on Australia's sovereignty. Unfortunately, the government would not budge on this particular issue, but it is an important one. It is an issue that goes to our sovereignty and it is an issue that is not transparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the legislation that has been put before the parliament, with the amendments the opposition has argued for. I do have some reservations about the issue of ISDSs and the impact it will have on our sovereignty, on our ability to determine what happens in our country, and on the impact it will have on Australian laws. Also, I still have concerns about issues relating to Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I once again congratulate the shadow minister for trade and the Leader of the Opposition for their great negotiating skills, and I congratulate the government for actually negotiating with Labor, even if it is at a very late stage after a lot of noise and abuse took place in the early stages. Good government is about negotiation and about getting a good outcome. We have an outcome here that is at least a beginning, and we can start working on it into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LL6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BALDWIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  I rise with pleasure to speak on the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. These bills and this agreement build this nation's opportunities for the future. I hear all the fear factors that have been put forward by the opposition on this free trade agreement, yet where were their concerns when they were developing free trade agreements in the six years that they were in government? Where was their opposition to the free trade agreements that were brought to fruition by this coalition government? The rules and the opportunities are exactly the same. One could argue that their opposition has been somewhat xenophobic, yet this same Labor opposition much heralds Gough Whitlam's approach to China many years ago with Mao Zedong in opening up opportunities for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not fear this free trade agreement; we should seize the opportunity with both hands. We need to make the most of this opportunity because, clearly and abundantly, if we do not, others will. China is the fastest-growing economy in the world. As people transition from low incomes through middle incomes to high incomes in China, their demands will only increase. We in Australia have the opportunity to supply those markets. The demand for clean, green food in particular is rising at an exponential rate each and every day. This agreement opens up further opportunity for Australian agricultural industries. I want to point out one in particular. We have all seen the news reports of Chinese families here amassing large amounts of baby formula and exporting it to China in the post. Under this free trade agreement, the tariff on infant formula will go from 15 per cent down to four per cent. That means that Australian companies will be able to process infant formula, which is great for our dairy industries, and have a better opportunity to export it into China. The demand for clean, green produce is high and Australia has the opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some in this House talk about how bad this will be. They should understand that Australia is an export market. If we wanted to no longer trade and to shut down our borders, what would we do with all the surplus agriculture, in particular, in Australia? I think we export in total around 85 per cent of our agricultural product, and the opportunity to do more is great. Another plus side, in particular for the Hunter Valley, is not just the reductions of tariffs on coal, on wine and on dairy and beef but also services technologies that support those industries. This will create increased job growth in my region of the Hunter Valley. As I say, we are not all about coal exports; we are about technology and services exports as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two other areas I want to raise quickly. No. 1 is education. The opportunities to grow the education sector to China are massive. Already it is worth around $4 billion per annum. Chinese students make up our greatest proportion of students in Australia, and we can do more. Not only that; our educational facilities will have the opportunity to set up more in China and have a direct relationship with those communities. And it is not all about the tier 1 markets of the Beijings, the Guangzhous and the Shanghais; the tier 2 and tier 3 markets in China are also important. The opportunity for tourism growth into China is one of our rapidly-growing opportunities. When I was in opposition, I helped write the coalition policy on tourism, which we are now working with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fantastic opportunity. Carpe diem—seize the moment. We can be ahead of the curve—ahead of other countries. We can seize these opportunities and we will grow jobs here in Australia and grow our trade, and that is great for the economy of this nation. Do not fear the opportunity; seize the opportunity. Let's work together because we need Chinese product coming into Australia. Just as they need our coal, our aluminium, our iron ore, our wine and our food, we need their products too. This is a symbiotic relationship—a relaxation of tariffs to each country—because it is a two-way trading arrangement; it is not a one-way trade arrangement. There are great opportunities and great economic benefits. I encourage all Australians, and in particular Australian businesses, to seize the opportunities and make the most of them—because, if we do not, other countries will, and that would be a loss and to the detriment of this great nation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  It is a great pleasure to rise to speak on these bills, which implement the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. As we have heard from everyone who has been speaking about this agreement, trade is essential for Australia's economic future. Labor understands that. It is in our national platform. As we say in our national platform:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More trade is a pathway to a high-skill, high-wage future for … Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been engaged in trade liberalisation forever. We are the party who deregulated the economy in the eighties. There was a dramatic transformation of the Australian economy in the eighties thanks to those initiatives. They were very challenging initiatives at times, and very confronting as we transformed our economy from a very high tariff, protectionist economy to a low-tariff or no-tariff economy that was deregulated in so many ways. As I said, it was very challenging for many, particularly on our side and particularly for workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, where, essentially, that whole industry was deregulated and tariffs, very gradually, were reduced to virtually zero. It is challenging to make the transition to a deregulated economy, an open and liberalised economy and an open and liberalised trading environment, but Labor has been courageous in the past. As I said, we made those enormous achievements in the eighties. We are the party that signed up to GATT in the forties. We are the party that materminded APEC. We are the party that masterminded the Cairns Group. We are the party that masterminded what is now the Indian Ocean Rim Association. We have a very strong track record on trade liberalisation, and we have shown it. We have proven it in terms of the multilateral architecture we have set up, the organisations and forums we have set up to advance trade liberalisation and economic cooperation from the forties right through to the eighties and today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have heard so much about over the past two days, China is an incredibly important market for Australia. It is already our No. 1 trading partner, and it accounts for a third of Australia's merchandise exports. It is already the world's second largest economy and is set to become the world's biggest economy during our lifetimes—right here in the region, the biggest economy in our lifetimes. It is a major new market, with hundreds of millions of increasingly affluent, increasingly middle-class consumers who want goods and services. We are seeing it with China and we are seeing it with India. And it is going to be an enormous source of valuable investment funds that Australia will need to create and grow new business opportunities and jobs in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Asia's middle class now numbers around 500 million and is expected to increase more than sixfold in the next 15 years. And, as I said, it is not just China. There has also been growth of the middle class in India, a country I have a very strong affinity with, having been posted there in the 1990s. I will be back there over the weekend for the inaugural Australia India Leadership Dialogue and am very much looking forward to taking part in that. But we have this burgeoning middle class in the region—in Indonesia, and it has been in Singapore for some time. I think people tend to focus a lot on China because it is so huge, but there is also have India, which is also incredibly huge and where there is very much a growing opportunity, particularly with the middle class and particularly in demand for a broad range of consumer goods and services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there are 500 million people in the middle class in Asia, on our doorstep, and by 2030 that will be 3.2 billion middle-class consumers in Asia, or 66 per cent of the world's middle class. A large slice of that is in China, and also in India. This is going to translate into rising demand for a range of products and services across a broad range of areas, including areas where Australia does very well. I am talking about food, about education—and not just higher education but vocational education. We are world leaders in vocational education, and there are great opportunities there, as well as in tourism, health, aged care, and financial and professional services. There are huge opportunities for cultural services and curatorial services, and helping both China and India to showcase their stories to their own people and to the world. We are world leaders in curatorial services, as well as in archiving and preservation, and I think there are real opportunities there, and real opportunities for Canberrans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in wine: my sister is a winemaker, and her husband is a winemaker. She is the first female master of wine in Australia, and her husband is frequently in China. He has just come back from winning a scholarship there. He is frequently in China engaging with winemakers there. Again, the wine industry in China is growing exponentially, so he is there as a consultant providing advice, and he is also part of this scholarship now to, hopefully, win a prize for making the best wine from Chinese grapes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On vitamins, I had a conversation with Marcus Blackmore about a month ago. I spoke to him about Young Endeavour, because he is actively involved in that. He was telling me that the demand for vitamins has grown by 200 or 300 per cent. It has been extraordinary—and very sudden. When Chinese people come to Australia one of the first trips they make is to one of Marcus Blackmore's shops or to a chemist to buy his vitamins, and the shelves are cleaned out. So, on the demand for vitamins, I think we have a good appreciation of what we can export now, of what is in the market, but I do not think we have even begun to wonder what can be exported in the future in terms of the opportunities out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there are many, many benefits to this agreement, and it does create significant opportunities for Australia. It will give Australian businesses greater access to the market. Under ChAFTA 85 per cent of Australian exports by value will enter China with no tariffs immediately. This will rise to 95 per cent when the agreement is fully implemented. China will remove or significantly reduce tariffs on Australian beef, sheepmeat, dairy products, horticultural products, wine, barley, seafood and processed foods. These sectors employ more than 200,000 workers. So, there are many benefits, and not just benefits for today's businesses, today's winemakers, today's producers, today's service providers and today's architects but also intergenerational benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Labor's concerns about some elements of this agreement have been well covered. I just want to talk about the fact that we entered into negotiations to ensure that there are a number of complementary safeguards in this agreement. That was designed to address concerns that were coming back from our communities. In my electorate I recently held a forum on the TPP with the member for Perth and the member for Rankin. It was very well attended. The discussion did not focus only on the TPP but also on ChAFTA and trade agreements more generally. Concerns were raised in a broad range of areas, and we have addressed those concerns in negotiating these safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These safeguards will require employers entering work agreements with the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection to conduct labour market testing before turning to overseas workers. Labour market testing requires employers to show that local workers are not available before they turn to 457 visa workers by providing evidence that they have advertised the jobs. We have also secured a government agreement to a series of additional safeguards for work agreements. These safeguards include requirements for employers to demonstrate that there is a labour market need to use 457 visa workers, to adopt training plans showing how they will train local workers to address skills shortages and to adopt overseas worker support plans showing how they will support 457 visa holders, including by providing information about workplace entitlements and rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also secured a major improvement in market salary rate requirements for 457 visa workers. It is a key safeguard designed to ensure that 457 workers are treated fairly and that temporary skilled migration does not undercut Australian wages and conditions. I think that is very important and a significant improvement to this agreement. It requires that 457 workers are employed on market salary rates and that wages and conditions are no less than those for a local worker performing the same job in the same location.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also secured agreement from the government to add new visa conditions for 457 workers in occupations where holding a licence is mandatory under state and territory workplace skills and safety laws. The new conditions will require 457 visa holders in these occupations not to perform the occupation without holding the relevant licence, to obtain the licence within 90 days of arriving in Australia, to comply with any conditions imposed on the licence, not to engage in any work or duties that are inconsistent with the licence and to notify the department in writing if they have been refused a licence or if their licence has been revoked or cancelled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude I want to touch on the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in this agreement, because there are legitimate public concerns over the impact of these provisions on public policies, particularly in areas of health care, public services and environmental protection. These concerns have not just come from my community and the broader community; they are also from mainstream economic and legal experts, including the Productivity Commission, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist</span>, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia Robert French, former head of the AIG and Reserve Bank of Australia board Heather Ridout and numerous academics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have led the way in arguing against ISDS provisions and in government we adopted the policy of not including these provisions in trade agreements. In opposition we continue to oppose ISDS provisions in trade deals because we do not believe the government should have included ISDS provisions in ChAFTA. If we are returned to government, we will seek to review all of Australia's existing ISDS provisions in trade and investment agreements with our trading partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to pay tribute to everyone involved in this significant agreement. I want to pay tribute to Simon Crean, to Craig Emerson, to Richard Marles, to Andrew Robb and to Penny Wong. Trade has always been a crucial part of Australia's economic world. It is vital to Australia's prosperity and growth in the future. This agreement will ensure that we will continue to grow and prosper. Australia has many products, services and skills that we want to share with the world and we are looking forward to the opportunities provided by this agreement for China to further explore our innovation and excellence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement, as I said, is not perfect. It does not address all of our concerns, but it will realise significant benefits for Australia for generations to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  Today is an absolute marquee day for this country, and it is therefore a great pleasure for me to speak on the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. Economic development and wealth creation in the 20th and 21st centuries have been reliant on two main things. The first is free and freer trade, a development we saw from the mid-20th century and continuing, obviously, to today. The other is, of course, technological improvements. We should never forget that the wealth that Australians enjoy today is because of the hard work of previous generations in breaking down trade barriers and ensuring freer trade. We have been one of the greatest beneficiaries of that of any nation in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is an extraordinary day for Australia, and I suspect there are lots of Australians out there—indeed, there might even be members in this House today, most notably some on the other side of the House—who do not appreciate how important this will be for our country for decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute first and foremost to Andrew Robb. He has done an extraordinary job in so quickly bringing these agreements to what has been, quite frankly, a very surprising conclusion. Free trade agreements by their very definition are negotiations. In some respects I was not expecting that we would get such a good deal out of China. The fact is that the Minister for Trade has been able to extract an extraordinary deal for this country. Eighty-six per cent of Australian goods will enter China duty-free, for example. That is extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to the leadership of our party and to every single backbencher and member on this side of the House, because we have stared down a disgraceful campaign from the union movement with the Labor Party following. Let's get it on the record that we would not be passing this legislation today had we not stared down that disgraceful campaign from the union movement and those opposite. For the hundreds of thousands of Australians who will get jobs and improved opportunities and for the small business men and women out there who will have a huge market increasingly to work with, I think thanks needs to go to each of the people on this side of the House, who in quite difficult circumstances stared down what we knew was a disgraceful campaign from those opposite. It is great that they are with us. We have brought them along. We dragged them kicking and screaming. So credit where it is due, of course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My home state of Victoria will be as big a beneficiary as any other state in this country. Victoria exports more than $4 billion worth of goods to China, including around $3 billion worth of goods in agriculture. There will be great gains for Victoria's farmers and agribusinesses, including those in the dairy industry, beef, sheep, horticulture, seafood, wine and wool. For my electorate of Deakin there will be great opportunities for advanced manufacturers. One business in my electorate—Timbermate, which manufactures putties and fillers—has a great domestic business here in Australia. They do great work with exports to the United States.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now they will have all tariffs on their goods into China removed. They have already indicated to me that they have now signed agreements with distributors in China in preparation for this agreement coming into force. The minute those trade barriers are removed their market will exponentially grow, because they are at the high end of their market. I have a number of advanced manufacturers in the Deakin electorate who will be exporting premium product to China. They therefore will be expecting a premium price. Trade barriers have made that difficult in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean? It means more jobs and more opportunities. For young people who have left school and are looking to get a job, this is great for them. For small business people who are looking for emerging markets and are now grasping the opportunities that the digital economy offers, this opens up such a huge market it is quite unfathomable. It is very difficult to quantify. The things we suspect today will be the great aspects of this agreement I suspect will be superseded by aspects that we cannot even envisage. If nothing else, this is going to be an outstanding legacy for our trade minister, Andrew Robb, and for every member on this side of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will end on a point I have made previously. This agreement would not be in place and would not be coming into force were it not for the fortitude and spine of those on this side of the House who stared down a disgraceful campaign from the union movement. I want every single Australian to understand that. I commend this bill to the House. This is a wonderful day for Australia.</span>

                    <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and I welcome the position of compromise that has been reached between the government and ourselves on the questions that were important to us on the Chinese free trade agreement, what was in that agreement and how it would impact on Australian workers, in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by pointing out that I live in the part of Australia that is closest to Asia—the Northern Territory. We have had contact with Chinese people and Chinese labour, in particular, since the 19th century. I do not think it is commonly known that by 1878 the South Australian government, which was then in control of the Northern Territory, had recruited so many Chinese labourers—or 'coolies', as they were then disparagingly known—that the Chinese were the largest non-Aboriginal group in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1888 there were 6,122 Chinese in the Northern Territory. There were few more than 3,000 people of European descent. So the Chinese population was double the European population. They were contracted to work on the goldfields. They sent money home and they spoke mainly Sze Yup or Hakka dialects. They worked hard and soon had their own gold claims. They established market gardens, most famously at Doctors Gully beside the Darwin Harbour, and engaged in general industry and commerce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, by the 1890s, as we know, sadly racism was alive and well and anti-Chinese feeling was particularly strong not only in the Northern Territory but across New South Wales and Victoria. Many Chinese people left the Territory but many also stayed on. Their family names are still strong in the Northern Territory community—Chin, Ah Toy, Lee, Chan and Fong Lim. These are some families that can trace their history back to this period. They settled permanently in the Territory and increased the extent of their commercial base, particularly in Darwin but also in Pine Creek and Katherine. So we in the Northern Territory are not new to this relationship with China or to Chinese workers coming to Australia and participating in work. At that point in history they were invited by the then government responsible for administering the Northern Territory, the South Australian government, to work on the goldfields.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But many things happened during the last century. One of which was the rise of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Revolution and the impact that had on the world community. The White Australia policy still existed in Australia then. We still had anti-Chinese rhetoric. There was the concept of the 'yellow hordes' coming down from Asia and impacting upon Australia. There were very racist and xenophobic statements and assertions made about our Asian friends and neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not until 1961 that a very significant trip took place when the then Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, HC Coombs, visited China. He told his Chinese hosts that Australia would welcome Chinese visitors. The Chinese took his words seriously. The following year, the President of the People's Bank of China visited Australia and was interested in meeting people, obtaining information and generally promoting trade. Nugget Coombs maintained that the revolution had not impaired China's tradition and commercial code of absolute reliability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Post 1961 up until 1971, there was not a lot of activity at least officially from government, except there was work being done by the then Wheat Board and the then Wool Board about trying to export Australian primary produce into the Chinese market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, as we know, was the first anniversary of the passing of the great Gough Whitlam. He was, without doubt, the first Australian leader to understand the need to engage and the importance of engaging with China. In 1971, as opposition leader, as part of the so-called doctrine of ping-pong diplomacy, he helped tear down the bamboo curtain and began the process of engagement between modern Australia and modern China. His meeting with the redoubtable Zhou Enlai began the process of building a modern relationship between the two nations, which he further developed when, as Prime Minister, he visited China in 1973—the first Australian Prime Minister to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Whitlam was breaking new ground with China, its economy was smaller than the Netherlands'. But he knew that this was a sleeper economy and that, given the right set of domestic and international circumstances, it would sleep no more. How right and how prescient Gough Whitlam was. Today, China's gross domestic product is nearly as large as that of the United States and seems likely to overtake it as the largest economy in the world within the near future. Whitlam understood the need to deal and trade with China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we move on to the Hawke and Keating years, and then, from a Labor perspective, in the Gillard and Rudd years we introduced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian century</span> white paper. This guided the way that the Australian government engaged not only with China but with the rest of the region as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John Howard started the process of negotiating a free trade agreement with China. That was followed by the Labor governments of Rudd and Gillard, whose trade ministers Simon Crean, Craig Emerson and Richard Marles advanced these interests. There is no question that this has been an imperative of both sides of politics since the mid-1990s. But it is a legacy of the work which had been previously done by a Labor Prime Minister and Labor governments up until then.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has always supported the principle of a China free trade agreement, as we well know, and as I know those members opposite also know. But we were blindfolded in our support for that agreement and for the negotiations. We had no participation. We did not see the content of the document. We did not know what was being negotiated until the final outcome was reached. Legitimately and quite properly, concerns were raised by interested people across this community about what might be in that document, and when the document was observed and seen and analysed, many people in the trade union movement rang alarm bells because they were interested and most concerned about protecting the interests of Australian working people. They were not xenophobic or racist, as they were called by the Abbott government, the government of the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall the denigrating way in which not only senior ministers in the current government but also ministers in the Abbott government stood at the dispatch box and described Labor members and trade union leaders in this country as xenophobic and racist. We know that those insults—and they were insults—showed the paucity of thinking or of any objective analysis by the government of the day, because Australian workers had every right to ask legitimate questions about what was in this agreement and how it would impact upon them. This is why, despite these descriptions of Labor and the unions as being xenophobic and racist, Labor has been able to achieve outcomes as a result of Labor negotiations. We do not have the same entrenched view that racism and xenophobia are part of the lexicon that the government uses to describe the opposition or the Labor movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the view that it was actually about time we sat down and had a yarn to work out what might be a reasonable outcome for Australian workers. That is why Labor argued for legal safeguards in three particular areas—safeguards which did not exist in the original agreement and which were highlighted by the trade unions. Such safeguards were denigrated by the government. Now, because we have reached this agreement at the behest of Labor, we have addressed the issues of labour market testing, protecting Australian wages and conditions, and upholding workplace skills and safety standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many who would argue those protections do not go far enough, and I understand their arguments. Had we been at the negotiating table, there would have been a different outcome. But we were not, and the best we could achieve, as a result of the fact that this was a done deal and that we were delivered with a fait accompli, was to deal with changes which would not impact directly on the agreement, and that is the outcome that what we have achieved has delivered.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that we have finally been able to achieve this agreement with the government. It is important that we acknowledge Andrew Robb, Penny Wong and the Leader of the Opposition for the work they have put in to negotiating an outcome. But let it not be said that because we have achieved this outcome that somehow or other we are xenophobic or racist. It is simply an insult which is wrong, disparaging and beneath contempt. Yet it is something which the government was pleased to advance across this dispatch box and in the public arena for the months leading up to the recent discussions between the trade minister and the shadow trade minister, Penny Wong.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that we have been able to achieve this outcome. It may not go far enough. We need to do more, and I look forward to working with the government to achieve the best outcomes we possibly can for Chinese investment in Australia and for jobs for Australians. Whether they are as a result of trade into China—beef from my own part of the Northern Territory, horticulture from the Northern Territory, mining produce from the Northern Territory, tourism from the Northern Territory are all very important things—I will look forward to getting those benefits and making sure that Australian workers' interests are properly protected, as are those of workers who are on 457 visas when they come to this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  What a fantastic day today is for Australia, because today is the day when through this parliament will pass the enabling legislation for Australia to implement the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. A world of opportunity is about to open as a consequence of this tremendous deal. The Minister for Trade and Investment has done a remarkable job on the deal with China, as well as the deals with Japan and South Korea and the TPP. He has excelled to a most significant degree in closing these very large deals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deal with China does not just benefit one or two industry sectors in Australia; it benefits so many parts of the Australian economy. There are hundreds of thousands of businesses in Australia that today will know opportunity is just around the corner, in increased sales into China. You might be in lamb, beef, nickel, titanium, legal services, accounting services, construction, uranium, horticulture, seafood or wine—the list goes on and on; dozens of industry sectors will benefit from the abolition of tariffs, the reduction of tariffs and the increased market access for services companies that are currently denied the capacity to operate in China or are heavily constricted in so doing. This deal changes all of that and it will create immense value for the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us back up a step and ask: why are we in this situation where we need to remove all these trade barriers? The reason is that historically governments—no doubt well meaning at the time, decades ago—set up a whole bunch of trade barriers that made products more expensive for consumers. That is what they do: they basically make things more expensive for consumers. Even worse than that, sometimes they even make it impossible for consumers to buy certain things. The net result is that people pay more for products. Instead of paying $10 for something, they might pay $12 or $13. If we are spending $12 or $13 on something that should have been $10, that means that there is less money available for other forms of investment and for other things that should be happening in the economy. Imposing trade barriers is an utterly counterproductive and destructive policy, and the economic history of the 20th century tells you that loud and clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is not just about some sort of theoretical discussion about free trade agreements. This government is about actually getting things done. It is very easy to say theoretically that we should reduce barriers to free trade, but this government and this minister have delivered in spades. Remarkably, in 1999 Australia's trade with New Zealand was bigger than our trade with China. 1999 is not that long ago, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure you remember those days. Back then the small island nation of New Zealand had a bigger trade with Australia than China did, which is extraordinary. But by 2013-14 China represented $160 billion of our trade in goods and services, 24 per cent of our entire world trade and was more than twice as big as our second-biggest trading partner. It is difficult to fathom that sort of growth. That growth occurred despite the fact that, in that 15-year period, there were still very significant barriers to trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade with China is a freight train going at a rapid speed, creating growth in the Australian economy. Through removing the remaining trade barriers, we supercharge it, we give it an extra boost and we open more and more doors. If you are in Hurstville, in my electorate of Banks, and you have a business that is involved in tourism services, for instance—taking people back and forth from China—there will be huge benefits for you in this deal. You might have an accounting firm in Hurstville that does business in China. There will be tremendous market access benefits for you in this deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Southern Region Chinese Business Association, based in my electorate, for their strong advocacy for this deal. I want to thank the member for Dunkley for his strong advocacy for this deal and for his visits to my electorate to champion it. This is a fantastic day for Australia. It has occurred despite the disingenuous, dishonest and wrong opposition that we have seen from the union movement. We are pleased to welcome those opposite in supporting this deal. It is a good thing that that has finally been achieved. This is a great day for Australia. It is a fantastic opportunity opening up today for many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australian businesses.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  As my colleagues have said, today is a very important and exciting day for Australia's economy going forward. For all the news about the challenges for Australia and my state of South Australia, with rising unemployment and the decline in mining and resources and manufacturing, there is always hope, whether it be in services or in areas in which we have a competitive advantage such as agriculture, wine, beef, seafood, dairy, tourism and health services. These are the strong foundations of our country and offer immense growth potential. As we have heard, there was a misleading union campaign on the free trade agreements, and we were disappointed at the approach that they took. But we have moved on, and they have come to the agreement that this is a good deal for Australia because they know that growth potential is heightened by the FTA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The increasingly wealthy and mobile middle class in China is creating new opportunities. The recently signed China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will bring unprecedented opportunities across a whole range of areas that I have already mentioned. It is estimated that these free trade agreements, with the China FTA at their centre, will result in thousands of jobs over the next 20 years. I am sure the guests in the gallery acknowledge the potential for the economy as a whole. Already we are seeing some quite extraordinary business opportunities and partnerships emerging between Australian and Chinese companies in anticipation of the China deal, which we hope will enter into force later this year. Sean Keenihan, the Vice President of the Australia China Business Council, from my state of South Australia, said the FTA would see greater trade volumes for South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent signing of the MOU between the Adelaide Produce Market and the Guangzhou Jiangnan Fruit and Vegetable Market is a prime example of the FTAs working for local growers. On the importance of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Angelo Demasi, the CEO, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">South Australian growers are extremely optimistic about the future trade conditions with China—with all tariffs on horticulture products to go within four to 8 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The recent special signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between Adelaide Produce Markets and GungZhou Jiangnan Fruit and Vegetable Market is a prime example of the FTAs working for local growers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry cannot just put their feet up and expect Chinese buyers to come rushing in with orders. They need to be proactive and get out there. They need to market their wares and really have a crack. As the Winemakers' Federation of Australia Chief Executive Paul Evans said on the China FTA:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The potential of how much value we can derive from this announcement is really now back in the hands of industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China will become Australia's top wine export market in value, even without the new FTA. With exports surging into China, the FTA will allow us to build on our strength that we have in the market, claiming a more dominant position. With China's middle class growing at levels that are hard to get your head around, this is an exciting time for Australian winemakers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our wineries are not the only ones who will be hoping that they can succeed, or will succeed, at taking advantage of the opportunities presented. There are a series of associated companies in the supply chain that will benefit, such as Lallemand at Edwardstown in my electorate and Collotype Labels at Mile End, as well as transport companies, professional advisers and contractors, and the list goes on. There will be more work for everyone as part of the supply chain and for services in those sectors that will benefit from the China FTA. I have just a quick note on Collotype as it is a great success story. It started in 1903 as a small print shop, which took its name from the best reproduction process of the day, collotype. Today this print shop has grown to become the world's largest and most awarded premium wine label printer. It is a great success story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wine is not the only industry that is going to get a boost from the free trade agreement. South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This free trade agreement ... will also have a particular effect on particular food characteristics, such as wine, meat, dairy produce, seafood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">China is our largest trading partner. China also is our fastest-growing trading partner. This free trade agreement will give us the impetus to grow that trade opportunity even further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hagen Stehr from the Stehr Group said that the China FTA will open a new market, and they are hoping to export 200 tonnes of tuna to China next year. Catherine Barnett, Chief Executive Officer of Food SA said that the free trade agreement provided a gift for food industries in South Australia. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is now up to businesses to seize this opportunity to grow by being smart with their marketing, branding and positioning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Darren Thomas, owner of South Australia's largest meat exporter, Thomas Foods International, said that the tariff reduction would allow the meat industry to be more competitive especially against the New Zealand market. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We certainly have had a heightened focus on China with the Free Trade Agreement in mind. We are working closely with our clients to ensure they are aware of the benefit of the FTA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Companies like Thomas Foods are based all around Australia but their head office and corporate facilities are in Adelaide. You get the professional services and people in the metropolitan regions benefit from what happens throughout the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I am a supporter of trade and companies that export. I worked in London for two years for the South Australian government promoting South Australia to Europe and saw, firsthand, the difficulties that companies have in accessing foreign markets. That is why the free trade agreements are so important, to give us that access and to give us those avenues. This is a unique opportunity to grow our economy. We must all act immediately to take advantage of the potential from increased trade with China in the best interests of our country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  I sometimes wonder how Australia's founding fathers would regard debates in this place were they to know that we would be sitting here with both sides of the parliament supporting trade liberalisation and supporting better engagement with China. Indeed, at the very moment this debate is taking place, the Queen of England is hosting Xi Jinping for a state dinner in London. Federation was founded around a protectionist settlement. That protectionist settlement was one with which the Country Party and the Labor Party were agreed. As late as 1948 Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley told parliament: 'If the matter had been left to us, we should not have initiated a conference to discuss the lowering of world tariff barriers.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That philosophy of protection-all-round, or McEwenism, supported by the Menzies government and its successors, was supported, too, by my side of politics. It was not broken until the 1973 tariff cut under Gough Whitlam. The 1973 cut is a great reminder of the power of ideas in shaping the world. Indeed, as Keynes once said: 'The world is ruled by little else.' Works from people such as Max Corden and Alf Rattigan were vital in providing the intellectual underpinnings for the tariff cut. It was a close-run thing. Whitlam's cabinet approved the 1973 tariff cut by a margin of only 16 votes to 11. History would have been quite different had the forces of closed economy seen the day at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then it has been Labor governments that have helped to bring down Australia's tariff barriers. The 1988 and 1991 tariff cuts were bold economic reforms which recognised the principles that, as Joan Robinson once put it: 'We should take the rocks out of our own harbours even if our trading partners do not take them out of theirs.' Over the trade office in Washington DC is the line, 'No nation was ever ruined by trade.' That great principle is nowhere more true than with Australia's trade with China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Deng Xiaoping first allowed private property experiments in the late 1970s, the Chinese economy has massively opened up and its living standards have exploded, increasing more than tenfold. To visit Beijing or Shanghai or many of the other large cities in China is to meet people of my age who remember going to bed as a child every night hungry, but who now enjoy a comfortable standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be an agreement which will benefit Australia's goods exporters. But the goods exports are just a part of the consumer benefits that flow from this trade agreement. As my colleagues, Clare O'Neil and Jim Chalmers, have articulately pointed out, services exports are a vital part of the benefits to be gained from this trade agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague, Tim Watts, pointed out in an excellent speech in this place last night, the gains from imports will be higher than the gains from exports. Productivity Commission modelling suggests that the free trade agreements undertaken by this government will boost Australian exports by 0.5 per cent and Australian imports by 2.5 per cent. It is ironic, given that, that the government has been referring to this as an export agreement rather than an import-export agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has ensured that there are a range of safeguards put in place around labour market testing, around protecting Australian wages and conditions and around protecting workplace skills and safety standards. They are issues that are important to many Australians and to those who represent workers. They are issues that have been raised with me at community group meetings right across my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's commitment to free trade runs deep, deeper than that of any other party in this parliament. Our commitment to China could not be stronger, going back to Gough Whitlam's brave decision—which was ridiculed by the conservatives of the day—to engage with mainland China and the growth opportunities that it represented. We support this agreement and we commend to the House the additional safeguards that have been put in place to not just ensure that we just get more goods exports, more services exports and cheaper imports but that we also safeguard Australian jobs in the process.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="9K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms GAMBARO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I wish to speak on the unbridled opportunities my electorate has before them if we ratify this historic trade deal with China; I know that that now is going to happen. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then ChAFTA is worth a billion opportunities: $1.4 billion, to be exact. Never has a trade of this scope meant so much to so many people. With increasingly fragile global markets and increasing deficits across the world, now more than ever it is the time to increase our economic ties to countries that will continue to grow their economies despite predictions stating otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China continues to outstrip expectations in its growth forecasts. This means that we must continue to grow trade with China if we wish to grow with it. China already takes one-third of our exports; our economic fate is already intrinsically linked with our Chinese neighbours. With this trade deal, more than 85 per cent of Australia's goods that are being exported to China will enter duty free when ChAFTA enters into force, rising to 93 per cent after four years and 95 per cent when ChAFTA is fully implemented. This is a huge win for our exporters and it means more money to grow our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China is already the strongest economy in Asia and soon China will be the biggest economy in the world. What ChAFTA does is give Australia and our exporters privileged access to the biggest market in Asia, which will soon be the biggest market in the world. Already, before it has even been ratified, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement is making a difference, with Australian-owned vitamin company Blackmores hiring an extra 100 employees to cater for the increased demand that they expect will come off the back of the lowering of tariffs. Indeed, increased exports and cheaper imports will allow Australian businesses to hire more workers. Compared to a scenario without our FTAs with China, Korea and Japan, annual net jobs are forecast to be up to 7,925 higher in 2016; peaking at 14,566 higher in 2020; and returning to 5,434 higher in 2035 than it would be otherwise, as a result of the free trade agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the shameful and racist scare campaign run by Labor and their dishonest union mates, more Australians want the ChAFTA than do not. This is despite the incorrect, misleading and quite frankly bigoted TV ads that the CFMEU having been ramming down the throats of Australians every single night on our TV screens. It is a testament to the strength, character, optimism and good nature of Australians that they have seen through Labor, they have seen through the union's scare campaign and they have jumped at the enormous and endless opportunities that this historic agreement will provide Brisbane and Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am absolutely excited about what this agreement is going to mean for my electorate and what this agreement means for the many, many businesses that are in the CBD of Brisbane. Recently, I held mobile offices throughout my electorate; locals want this agreement, they support it and they see the incredible opportunities that are going to arise for themselves, for their children and for their grandchildren as we move into the Asian market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent economic modelling shows that Australia's FTAs with China, Japan and Korea will together add $24.4 billion to the Australian economy over the period of 2016 to 2035. Increasing economic activity under the FTAs will also support higher incomes, and real wages are forecast to be 0.5 per cent higher by 2035 as a result of the FTAs. Higher incomes and lower prices under the FTAs will benefit every Australian household. Over the period from 2016 to 2035, real consumption per household is forecast to be $4,348 higher than without the three free trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically for my electorate of Brisbane, the opportunities are truly endless. To say this agreement is exciting news for Brisbane is an understatement. Not only does my electorate lay claim to some of the best and brightest people in the country but it also lays claim to individuals and businesses that are at the very forefront of competition and innovation in the world. The area of greatest opportunity to my constituents is the ability to export our world-class services so that we may be able to provide what we do well here and provide that to China as well. China is Australia's largest services market, with exports in services valued at $8.2 billion in 2014. This means more opportunities for local business and more opportunities for people in Brisbane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In ChAFTA, China has offered Australia its best ever services commitment in an FTA. Most valuably, this includes new or significantly improved market access for Australian banks, insurers, securities and futures companies, law firms and professional service suppliers, education service exporters, as well as the many, many businesses in my electorate in the health, aged-care, construction, manufacturing and telecommunications industries. This will give businesses like River City Labs in Brisbane, which supports early stage and start-up companies in the mobile, internet, telecoms and technology sector, a springboard to access Chinese buyers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreement also includes a 'most favoured nation' clause, under which Australia's competitive position into the future will be protected if China extends any more beneficial treatment to other trade partners in the sectors of education, tourism and travel related services, construction, engineering, and a whole litany of other sectors. So Australia wins again. This means that we will stay one step ahead of our trade competitors, who cannot compete with the quality of our products and the quality of our fantastic service industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of joining architectural firm dwp/suters only a few months back to celebrate their 30 years in business. They are an award-winning architectural firm, already with global reach. They are already doing incredible work in Asia and they are based in my electorate. They will have a chance to provide the incredible expertise they have in building wonderful hospitals, other public buildings and cutting-edge products to Chinese people and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brisbane, the legal and geographical capital of Queensland and the heart of the legal fraternity, will also have guaranteed market access. Australian law firms can establish commercial associations with Chinese law firms in the Shanghai free-trade zone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care is another area with ample opportunities ahead for local businesses in my electorate to explore. The senior living industry in China is yet to meet the demands of its very large aged population. It is still very much underdeveloped. It is waiting and hungry for innovative businesses to satisfy the huge demand for this type of service. As of February 2014, the aged population of China exceeded 200 million, almost 10 times the population of Australia. This number is as unfathomable as it is exciting, because local businesses like Ozcare Palm Lodge will be able to have direct access to that market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is similar in the early childcare area. Brisbane business Charlton Brown, a nanny agency which already provides services to China, will have much deeper access to potential customers. I want to acknowledge the incredible work that they do in Brisbane, training nannies and aged-care providers. They are an exceptional firm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally exciting will be the opportunity for local fashion designers and retailers, who will have access to more than one billion potential clients. With growing disposable incomes, premium jewellery and clothing are expected to be much more popular among consumers in China. Fashion is fast becoming more global, with more international brands appearing in China. This free trade agreement will support the local fashion brands that I buy in my electorate. They will be able, if they wish, to hit the streets of Shanghai as well. In addition, the increasing exposure to international fashion trends and growing personal wealth are likely to drive stronger demand for luxury items in China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This opens the door for small and innovative businesses in Brisbane to capitalise on the opportunities that we as a government have created. Businesses like sass &amp; bide, Sacha Drake, Miss Henry in Paddington, and Jules &amp; Roc in the valley, who provide the latest trends to locals, will now have access to one of the hugest populations in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with Australia's other bilateral trade agreements, remaining Australian tariffs on Chinese imports will be eliminated progressively. This includes removing the five per cent tariff on Chinese manufactured exports, electronics and whitegoods, with consumers and businesses to benefit from lower prices and the greater availability of Chinese products. Classic economics dictates that demand is not satisfied until the appropriate amount of supply is produced. In this case, Australia may not on its own be able to produce and provide enough supply for the voracious Chinese economy, but this free trade agreement gives my constituents of Brisbane and the vast majority of Australians every single opportunity to grow their businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a historic agreement, one that crosses the political divide. It has garnered support from Labor luminaries, Labor premiers and Labor state opposition leaders. While the opposition are in here today supporting it, sadly that has not always been the case. Today they have begrudgingly come into the chamber and they say they are going to vote for the bill, but they are still clinging to some of those CFMEU inspired talking points. I want to say to those opposite and to the Leader of the Opposition: get on with it. I know you have had input into the negotiations and now the deal looks much clearer than it did in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this agreement. It is absolutely fantastic news for Brisbane. It is great news for Australia. I congratulate Minister Robb for his tireless work. He has been an exemplary minister and a superstar in dealing and sealing free trade agreements with Japan and South Korea, as well as signing this historic agreement. This government will be remembered for its free trade principles, and Minister Robb will be remembered as the architect. I commend the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Macarthur for his good grace in allowing me to get a brief opportunity to speak. I rise to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 to enact the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, or ChAFTA, as it is more commonly known.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China is Australia's largest trading partner. It buys almost a third of all Australian exports, valued at nearly $108 billion in 2013-14, and is our top overseas market for agriculture, resources and services exports. Chinese investment in Australia has been growing strongly in recent years, reaching almost $65 billion in 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I know there has been some concern in my community about Chinese investment. Since coming to government, we have strengthened Australia's foreign investment framework. The Australian government has the ability to screen Chinese investments at lower thresholds than ever before for agricultural land and sensitive sectors like media, telecommunications and defence-related industries. Previously, foreign purchases of agricultural land were only subject to the national interest test and close scrutiny if they were worth more than $252 million. On 1 March this year, we reduced that screening threshold from $252 million to $15 million. That means that any agricultural land purchases worth more than $15 million are now subject to closer scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to emphasise the fact that the China FTA will not threaten Australian jobs. Chinese investors will only be able to temporarily bring in skilled overseas workers when suitable Australian workers cannot be found. They must receive the same pay and conditions as Australian workers, and Australian workers must be given the first opportunity, unless there is evidence of a genuine labour market need. For example, the companies must provide evidence of their domestic recruitment efforts and why applicants were unsuccessful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former engineer and someone who ran a safety inspection and training business, I know just how important it is that people actually know what they are doing. Contrary to what the scaremongering unions would have us believe, the China FTA will not allow electricians to work in Australia without any skills assessment. All applicants for subclass 457 temporary work visas will still need to have the requisite skills, qualifications and work experience. I would like to briefly mention the contribution from the member for Bendigo and suggest strongly to the member that the member actually looks up the definition of statute law and the application for training, for licensing, for workplace health and safety inside state boundaries, because quite simply that is the place where these things are enforced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another myth surrounding the China FTA is that it will allow businesses to import dangerous substances such as asbestos. Under the agreement, all of Australia's safety regulations and prohibitions on imports and exports remain in place. The ChAFTA does not allow food importers to bypass Australia's food safety standards and import contaminated foods. Our science based biosecurity system remains in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this agreement is a significant win for all the producers of fresh and processed food in my electorate. China buys more of Australia's agricultural produce than any other country, and that is only expected to grow with this landmark agreement. China is Australia's largest agriculture and fisheries export market, worth $9 billion in 2013-14, up from $5 billion in 2010-11. The absence of a bilateral FTA with China has meant Australian producers and exporters have faced significant tariffs on agricultural products and have been at a competitive disadvantage to countries that have an FTA with China, such as New Zealand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ChAFTA gives Australia a significant advantage over larger players such as the US. Let me give you some brief examples. Tariffs of up to 65 per cent on spirits, like the famous Bundaberg Rum, will be eliminated within four years. There will be elimination of the 10 to 25 per cent tariff on macadamia nuts within four years, and elimination of the 10 to 30 per cent tariff on all fruit, except citrus, within four years, with the tariffs on citrus eliminated in eight years. It also means the elimination of the 10 to 13 per cent tariff on all fresh vegetables within four years. Tariffs will also be eliminated on canned goods, fruit juices, chocolate and honey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian seafood exports to China totalled $37 million in 2013-14. Tariffs will be eliminated progressively over the next four years on all Australian seafood exports, including crabs, scallops and prawns, which is good news for the people in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China has guaranteed that Australian service suppliers are able to construct, renovate and operate wholly Australian-owned hotels and restaurants in China. Australian medical service suppliers will be able to establish wholly Australian-owned hospitals in China. China has made its first ever commitment in an FTA on aged-care services, allowing Australian medical service suppliers to establish wholly Australian-owned profit-making aged-care institutions in China with no geographical restrictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What all this means is that our local businesses will find it easier to break into or expand within the Chinese market. Growing their businesses ultimately leads to the creation of more local jobs—jobs that are desperately needed in my electorate. They are jobs for current and future generations, and I am absolutely delighted to be part of a government that has delivered such a landmark agreement. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M2V" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I rise today in support of the free trade agreement with China which was successfully signed by the government here in Canberra on 17 June this year. Over the last two years this government has had tremendous success in negotiating free trade agreements with our Asian partners including South Korea, Japan and now China. Prior to 2003, Australia's only agreement was with New Zealand. Since then, Australia has entered into agreements with Singapore, Thailand, the US, Chile, Malaysia and of course Japan and Korea. In addition, the Minister for Trade and Investment, the Hon. Andrew Robb, recently announced the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations with his counterparts from 11 other countries earlier this month, which will deliver significant benefits to Australia, including new opportunities for our businesses, farmers, manufacturers and service partners in the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Australia has a long history of supporting trade liberalisation, and I am extremely proud of how well this government has built on that legacy. The government's FTA policy aims primarily at maximising the benefits flowing into Australia from the negotiation of these agreements. We know that the FTAs foster freer trade flows and create stronger ties with our trading partners. The FTAs can increase Australia's productivity and contribute to higher GDP growth by allowing domestic businesses to access cheaper inputs, introducing new technologies and fostering competition and innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FTAs do not just eliminate tariffs. They also address behind-the-border barriers that impede the flow of goods and services between parties, encourage investment and enhance cooperation, and can address other issues such as intellectual property, e-commerce and government procurement. FTAs can enhance the competiveness of Australian exports in the partner market and add to the attractiveness of Australia as an investment destination. FTAs promote regional economic integration and build shared approaches to trade and investment, including through the adoption of common rules of origin and through broader acceptance of product standards. It is therefore undeniable that the signing of a free trade agreement with China is a monumental achievement by this government that will benefit all Australians, now and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China is of course our largest trading partner, and this deal will result in increased market access outcomes in agricultural exports, resources, energy and manufactured goods exports, service exports and investment. We only need to look at New Zealand, which signed an FTA with China in 2008 which resulted in more than a tenfold increase in New Zealand's exports to China, to see the remarkable benefits of such an agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is a great day for this parliament because Labor has finally come to its senses and has chosen to support this historic agreement. I have to admit I find the timing of Labor's change of heart a little curious. As we all know, the CFMEU have been running a virulent and extreme campaign against the agreement, trying to spook the public about hordes of Chinese workers coming to our shores and stealing our jobs, or dodgy Chinese electricians endangering us in our homes through supposedly shoddy work standards—a shameful campaign of fear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only this week my office received a glossy package in the mail from the Electrical Trades Union entitled, 'China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: Original Documents with Detrimental Labour Impacts'. This campaign by Labor and the unions is one of the most disgraceful and misleading campaigns that I have had the misfortune of witnessing. The real tragedy of this xenophobic campaign is the effect it is having on people in the community. In September, for instance, I received an email from Bill Guthrie, a local resident from Mount Annan, who wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr. Matheson</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I spent thirty years as an Electoral contractor. If what Labor is saying i.e. that on a project worth more than $150 million the Chinese can bring their own workforce ... then someone needs to think about the future of their own kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I forwarded Mr Guthrie's email to the Honourable Andrew Robb's Office for clarification and here is the response:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Department of Immigration and Border Protection has made it clear that employers seeking to engage overseas workers under a labour agreement must provide evidence of labour market testing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the department will only enter into a project labour agreement where it has been satisfied that Australians have been provided the first opportunity for jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there we have it in plain English: employers will not be permitted to bring in overseas skilled workers unless there is clear evidence of a genuine labour market need as determined by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. There will be no reduction in wages for any workers under the FTA with China and the market salary rates and employment conditions that applied before this agreement will continue after it enters into force. Yet the ETU package claims that the FTA with China bypasses legislated procedures for labour market testing and establishing wages and conditions. I find it incredibly disappointing to have received a document like this, which illustrates why people like Mr Guthrie, a local resident of mine, have been so confused and apprehensive about the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you what this agreement means for the a2 Milk Company, a business in my electorate that employs many local people. The a2 Milk Company is currently the largest Australian exporter of branded fresh milk into China which it began exporting in August 2014. According to the managing director, Geoffrey Babidge, the growing reputation of the a2 Milk Company in Australia has been driven by strong word-of-mouth recommendations from Chinese nationals living in Australia to their friends and relatives in China. The company is very pleased about the opportunity the FTA provides in boosting access into the China market for their brand, which in turn will provide increased returns for our dairy farmers and more jobs in food processing on a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, the FTA with China will mean more jobs, more export opportunities and will be a major boost to our economy. I look forward to seeing my electorate of Macarthur reaping the benefits.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="139441" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr O'DOWD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  It is a pleasure to speak today on the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and related bill. I believe it is a fantastic day for Australia because we have come to an agreement with our biggest trading partner: China. Australia exported $108 billion in goods to China in 2013-14 and we imported less than half, about $52 billion, in the same year. The trade agreement will assist with future jobs and growth in all sectors. This agreement will have outstanding benefits for people in Australia, including people in Flynn. As you know, we are a bit of a powerhouse when it comes to a lot of these export products, through Gladstone port. It is a godsend for our agriculture industry. China buys more of our agriculture produce than any other country. There are markets worth over $8 billion in agriculture and farming. It is a very broad sector in Central Queensland and there will be big advantages for our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The President of the Australian National Farmers Federation, Brent Finlay, said the peak farm body is relieved that politics have been put aside in the interests of Australia's economic future. He went on to say, 'This agreement is a game-changer for Australian agriculture.' With that backdrop, in Central Queensland we can look forward to tariffs being eliminated on barley and sorghum. Beef exports tariffs of 12 to 25 per cent will be totally eliminated over the next nine years. Dairy tariffs up to 20 per cent will be eliminated in four to 11 years. There will be rapid tariff reductions on seafood, sheep meat, pork and horticulture, including macadamia nuts. It is certainly good news for my electorate, especially primary producers in the Central Highlands and the citrus growers in North Burnett and Wallaville.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry in Gladstone will benefit because China is our largest market for resources and energy products. Last year, Australia exported more than $80 billion worth of resources, energy and manufactured products to China. The FTA will immediately see 92.9 per cent of these products enter China duty-free. Most remaining tariffs will be removed after four years. When the FTA is fully implemented, 99.9 per cent of our resources, energy and manufacturing products will enter China duty-free. Coal, a big export product from my electorate, has a tariff on it and that will be reduced. There is a tariff on coking coal that will be reduced over a three-year term, along with the tariff on thermal coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate several people, but most of all Minister Andrew Robb for his role in securing benefits for Australia under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This has been worked on over many years. I would also like to thank Senator Penny Wong and past ministers from the Labor government, Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson. There was good support from Bob Carr and, of course, Bob Hawke. I congratulate everyone involved in this free trade agreement. I look forward to seeing the effects of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement as businesses in my electorate make use of the improved trading conditions. It does not stop with the signing of the agreements. They still need to be worked on, but the groundwork is done for us to succeed and reap value from this free trade agreement. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

To me, this is one of the most memorable bills I can remember coming through this place in almost eight years. It is something that has been spoken about for some time. It is something the people in the electorate of Parkes have been looking forward to for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Parkes is an export oriented electorate, with a large amount of agriculture, produce and minerals coming from the area. I know it has been a great frustration to producers in my electorate that the great market to the north was somewhat impeded by tariffs. In the last few years, New Zealand particularly has had an advantage because of their free trade agreement. We have things like a reduction on beef of between 12 and 25 per cent within nine years, 12 to 23 per cent on sheep meat within eight years, frozen sheep meat offal is to be reduced within seven years, and, as well, there are the hides and skins. The dairy at Dubbo is doing great work in trying to grow a market into China. They and all of the others will welcome this agreement. Businesses like Fletcher International abattoir at Dubbo, which produces a large amount of sheep meet that goes to China, will now be able to compete on a level playing field with our cousins over the ditch in New Zealand. That is going to be of great benefit to the people of western New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coupled with the free trade agreements with South Korea and Japan, and the upcoming Trans-Pacific Partnership, at last we are starting to see trade liberalisation on a scale that will put Australia at the centre of the large markets in our region and around the Pacific. To Australia, as an export oriented country, and to the export oriented area I come from, that is a good thing. The world has become a smaller place. In my electorate we now have farmers harvesting grain and marketing it on their smartphones as they are sitting in their headers. The world has become a much smaller place, and these free trade agreements, and this one in particular, will help us to cope with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the next challenge will be an agreement with India, a large emerging market to our north, a country that is growing and pulling itself out of poverty. They will have a need for access to the produce we grow and they will be looking for markets for things they manufacture. This is a significant milestone. It is a great tribute to many people. The final hurdle was overcome by Trade Minister Andrew Robb. I have great admiration for Andrew Robb. I think he has done a great job. Also, I congratulate the opposition for their agreement. I was disappointed to see the union campaign on the labour access issue. I believe that those concerns can now be put to bed. Australian workers can feel comfortable that their jobs are not at risk and that the upside of this is that it will lead to more employment and opportunities for the Australian people. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">I saw a recent article stating that, given his achievements, if Minister Robb were an athlete he would have won gold for Australia in the 100 metres and then the 200 metes, the 400 metes and the 800 metres, which would be a magnificent athletic feat in an Olympic arena, and his efforts are no less of an accomplishment. All acknowledgements should go to you for </span>
                    <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">what has evaded so many governments before ours. Congratulations to you, Minister Robb, as you enter the chamber to deliver your wrap-up on this significant bill.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The IMF recently has put out some global growth forecasts, and I think there have been 15 downgrades of growth forecasts. We are looking closer to two per cent over the forward estimates. But the constant in their formulaic equation is that the world needs growth, and the majority of that growth is going to be driven from China. So it should not be surprising to anyone that a country like Australia would be looking for closer ties with such an economic powerhouse, which is widely tipped to take over from superpower America. It is not a matter of if; it is a matter of when. All international commentators are united in the position that China is a growing powerhouse.</span>
                  </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">I associate myself also with the comments of the previous speaker, who spoke about where the next opportunity lies after China, that being India. I suggest that that is a real opportunity for our country.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">In having a look at why it took so long for the government to get this deal across the table, looking at the Australian Labor Party and their relationship with the Australian union movement from afar it perplexingly looks like the two are so desperately interwoven that the two are now indistinguishable from one another. With an agreement like this, with so many up-sides for my electorate and for the beef and dairy sectors—which I want to get back to before I conclude—we wonder why the Australian Labor Party, coupled with the Australian union movement, which ran a national ad campaign, wanted desperately for this free trade agreement to be stopped. You can only make the assumption that is not that dissimilar to the assumptions that have been made in the current royal commission on union corruption, union coercion, union thuggery, and union intimidation.</span>
                    <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">
                    </span>These are the tools of trade of these two parties. They are now interwoven and inseparable from each other, so we should not be surprised that we saw a Labor anti-fair-trade agreement which used the tools of coercion, intimidation, bullying and scare tactics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to my electorate of Wright, the Stanbroke pastoral company have their processing plant in the Lockyer Valley. They are outstanding performers. They stand to benefit personally, as do the workers of that company, as a result of this free trade agreement. Tariffs of between 12 and 25 per cent will be eliminated within nine years, including the elimination of the 12 per cent tariff on beef offal within four to seven years. You might think, 'Beef offal—so what?' but that is up to 25 per cent of the beef carcass. China's demand for high-quality beef is growing rapidly, driven by a growing middle class. The Stanbroke pastoral company, based in the Lockyer Valley, are currently sending boxed meats to China. This agreement will only boost their ability to expand the export of beef into China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch briefly on our emerging dairy industry as well, with the benefits that will flow through to my dairy farmers as a result of the reduction in tariffs around infant formula, fresh milk, ice cream, liquid milk, cheeses, butters and yoghurts within nine years. Mind you, we lag behind New Zealand in these negotiations. We would not be in this position if those on the other side of the House, when in government, were more proactive in this area. It makes my opening comments to Minister Robb all the more heartfelt. I have some of the largest horticultural growers in the country in my electorate. They, too, will stand to benefit from this trade negotiation—farmers like Matt Hood of Rugby Farm, Fabian Carnell of Mulgowie, Robert Hinrichsen and family, and Richard Gorman of Kalfresh. Their tentacles already extend into the Asian market. As we work through the bio-sanitary issues around product trade, it will only provide greater certainty for small businesses and farmers alike in my electorate of Wright.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more I could say about the free trade agreement in the time that has been extended to me, but I close by encouraging all of my farmers and all those in the electorate of Wright to take advantage of the opportunities that have been presented as a result of these wonderful negotiations. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="FU4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBB</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I rise to conclude the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015. The bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will implement Australia's tariff commitments in the agreement. These amendments are complementary to those contained in the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to this debate. This is a truly historic agreement for our country. I am pleased that so many members have highlighted in some detail the wide array of benefits on offer. I also again acknowledge those opposite for the bipartisan support they are providing both to these bills and to the free trade agreement. Given the bipartisan support that this agreement has secured in this place, any continuation of the hugely dishonest campaign that has been waged against the free trade agreement by the likes of the CFMEU and the ETU would expose just how totally disingenuous it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Negotiations on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement began in 2005. It is worth reflecting on the significant changes that have occurred in both our economies in those 10 years. In 2005, Australia was at the start of the mining boom and the global financial crisis was beyond the horizon. China was our third largest merchandise export partner. Today, China is our largest export market and our largest trading partner overall, with our two-way trade now worth around a staggering $150 billion. Our trade with China accounts for around 23 per cent of all our trade. China's economy has also changed significantly since that time. During the course of these free trade agreement negotiations, China has become the world's second largest economy. Tens of millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty, and its middle class has expanded substantially. China has also embarked on significant reforms to its financial system. Its economy is in transition from a manufacturing and investment focus to a more consumer and services based focus. Just this week, we saw how retail consumption in China was up 10.9 per cent on the previous year, which is substantial given the Chinese retail market is worth around US$4 trillion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This puts into some perspective the scale of new export opportunity that is opening up across a wide array of goods and services. Notwithstanding this record of extraordinary growth and activity over the last 10 years, the world knows that China still has a long way to go to reach its potential. That is why this free trade agreement is so important. The relationships, both ways, that we have struck to date are added enormously to by this free trade agreement. It does mark the beginning of a whole new phase of opportunity for Australia—and for China, for that matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, Australia is extremely well placed to help in some way to meet China's growing demand in areas such as premium food—whether it be dairy products, quality beef, fruit and vegetables, seafood, wine or processed food—and in value-adding manufacturing and across myriad services, including secondary school education, university and vocational training, financial services, health, hospital and aged care services, tourism and hospitality, construction, architecture and design, project management, water management, agricultural genetics, irrigation, environmental services and logistics—to name but a few.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement positions Australia to take advantage of these emerging opportunities now and into the future. ChAFTA represents an agreement of outstanding quality between these two highly complementary economies. My Chinese counterpart, Minister Gao Hucheng, has described the deal as 'the most liberalising trade agreement China has ever signed'. This is an achievement that speaks volumes about the commitment of both sides to maximise the potential in the trade and investment relationship. China has recognised, as it moves to a consumer based economy, that it needs the expertise of countries like Australia, especially across services, food production, food processing and high-end manufacturing. Our brand in China—and in much of Asia, for that matter—is gold standard when it comes to our service offerings across literally hundreds of services. China needs that expertise to help bring its own population, in a comprehensive way, to the same level of world-class service provision across lots of areas. It also means that Australian businesses large and small have been given the opportunity for first-mover advantage because we have concessions that no other country is yet to receive. Notably, it also affords Australia most favoured nation status in services and investment, which means Australia is guaranteed to secure better concessions that China affords to any other country in the future in these areas of services and investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been pleased to hear the almost endless supportive comments from businesses and industry bodies regarding the free trade agreement. For example, Brendan Pearson, Chief Executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The trade agreement with China is an unambiguously good deal for Australia. It is a high quality agreement that will deliver stronger economic growth, more jobs and better living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National Farmers' Federation President Brent Finlay said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ChAFTA is a game-changer for Australian agriculture: providing unprecedented access to the world’s second largest economy and underpinning the competitiveness of many of our key agricultural exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noel Campbell, President of Australian Dairy Farmers, said recently:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the ChAFTA is ratified this year, the dairy industry alone will see a growth in job creation across the value chain. This means more jobs for farmers and more jobs in processing plants and logistics. We expect that around 600 to 700 jobs will be created within the first year of ratification. The flow-on effects of this growth would undoubtedly benefit the rural and regional communities where dairy plays an important role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ChAFTA provides Australia with a competitive advantage over our major competitors, including the United States, Canada and the European Union. It also levels the playing field for Australia with regard to certain commodities, putting us on the same footing as or on an improved footing compared with New Zealand, Chile and South-East Asian nations that currently have free trade agreements in place with China. For our resources and energy sectors, ChAFTA eliminates all tariffs of up to eight per cent within four years, including for coal, worth around $8.3 billion within two years. ChAFTA provides greater certainty for our exporters by locking in current zero tariffs on major resources and energy products, including iron ore, gold, crude petroleum oils and LNG. Under ChAFTA, China will eliminate tariffs on 99.9 per cent of our resources, energy and manufacturing exports to China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to highlight the benefits of ChAFTA for Australia's services industry. We know services are an increasingly important part of our economy; 75 per cent of our GDP is derived from services, yet only 17 per cent of our exports. The opportunity gap is enormous. It is perhaps less well known that the Chinese services sector is now in fact larger than its manufacturing sector. But China has about 52 per cent of its GDP coming from services; the First World countries are up at around 75 per cent, as Australia is. And its services sector is already a major driver of GDP growth. China is already Australia's largest services export market, worth about $8.2 billion in 2014. And under this agreement we have the potential to very, very substantially grow our services trade with China, creating new jobs and prosperity for Australia and, in particular, new investment opportunities for our small and medium businesses to, again, properly develop their expertise and their service business into a market of 1.4 billion people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at financial services, which present an enormous opportunity for Australia. The Financial Services Council estimates that this agreement could potentially add $4 billion to our economy and create 10,000 jobs in the financial services sector by 2030 in Australia—10,000 new jobs in one sector alone. With the advent of the digital age and much greater and cheaper airline connectivity, combined with the significant advantage associated with being in the same time zone, an opportunity for small and medium businesses to establish a presence in China is now highly feasible. In ChAFTA, China has offered Australia its best ever services commitments in a free trade agreement beyond greater China. Most valuably, this includes new or significantly improved market access for Australian banks, insurers, securities and futures companies, law firms, professional service suppliers and education service exporters, as well as in health, aged care, construction, manufacturing, telecommunications and so much more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australia's first minister for investment I am pleased that this agreement improves opportunities for investors in both countries. Chinese investment in Australia has been growing strongly in recent years, up from $2 billion 10 years ago to around $65 billion at the end of 2014. ChAFTA will promote further growth of Chinese investment into Australia, in particular by liberalising the Foreign Investment Review Board screening threshold for private Chinese investors in non-sensitive sectors from $252 million to just over $1 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not underestimate the importance of the headturning effect of this agreement in China. Since our governments announced the conclusion of ChAFTA negotiations in November last year we have seen increased interest from Chinese businesses and investors looking for partnerships and opportunities in Australia. Australian businesses, too, are looking to seize the opportunities on offer for partnerships and investments in China. And, as I mentioned earlier, the opportunity for small and medium businesses is profound. It is an enormous opportunity to grow so many areas of world-class expertise, to grow our market into a market of an extra 1.4 billion people, compared with trying to further develop opportunities or find opportunities in a market of 23 million people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August I led a delegation of 35 Australian CEOs to Beijing. They and their companies are hard at work driving business that will boost prosperity in Australia for years to come. On that trip, vitamin supplements manufacturer Blackmores and meat exporter Sanger Australia each signed agreements with JD.com to sell their products on China's largest online shopping website. I think something like 300 million people are currently signed up to JD.com. It is a massive worldwide online shopping website. Australian products and services are meeting the needs of China's middle class, enabled by e-commerce and other emerging technology, and ChAFTA will help our competitive edge. The sense of anticipation within the Chinese business community was palpable. In support of this observation, I acknowledge the many contributions to this debate by members in this chamber. Some typical examples include that of the member for Lyne, Dr David Gillespie, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even the announcement of the trade agreement … has led to hundreds and thousands more cases of wine leaving the Hastings valley on the mid-north coast in the north of the Lyne electorate and heading to China. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Ryan, Jane Prentice, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the slowdown in mining, the service economy share of exports to China will only grow further. For the service economy, this agreement is crucial.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Longman, Wyatt Roy, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">the idea of starting an Australia business with the intention to sell to a marketplace of just 23 million people will seem somewhat archaic and retro. The opportunities the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will unlock mean … we will have access to billions of people …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Eden-Monaro, Peter Hendy, talked about Australia's oyster coast in his electorate, which has 'expectations of sales tripling', as the existing tariffs on oysters will be eliminated under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The member for Bass, Andrew Nikolic, noted the innumerable economic, social and cultural benefits of the FTA for both countries, adding:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I think history will see, in 20 years time, that these are the most profound changes of this era of Australian history, because trade integration is the beginning of a much deeper integration with countries that will shape the world in the coming years, and we absolutely must be part of it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The customs legislation we have debated is the only legislative change that parliament needs to approve for ChAFTA to enter into force. The Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 contains amendments to the Customs Act 1901. These amendments implemented Australia's obligations under chapter 3 on rules of origin, as set out in the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. These rules are essential for the purposes of determining whether goods imported from China are eligible for the preferential rates of customs duty under the free trade agreement. The bill also contains amendments to include relevant obligations on Australian exporters and producers who wish to access preferential treatment under the agreement when exported to China. Certain powers are also conferred on authorised officers to examine records and ask questions of exporters or producers of goods exported to China in order to verify the origin of such goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Customs Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 contains amendments to the Customs Tariffs Act 1995 that will implement Australia's tariff commitments set out in the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The amendments in the two bills are complementary. The associated Customs Regulations, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulations and Life Insurance Regulations will also require amendment in due course. A ministerial determination under the Migration Act is also required. Implementing this agreement will require only minimal changes to Australia's current policy settings. It is crucial that we pass these bills without delay so that this agreement can enter into force as soon as possible. Many business leaders have urged early entry into force to allow the benefits, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, to start to flow. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the work of JSCOT in conducting its extensive inquiry into ChAFTA. I would particularly like to acknowledge the former chair of JSCOT, the member for Longman, in chairing this inquiry and congratulate the member for Hume on his election as chair of JSCOT and for tabling the committee's report earlier this week. Members of the committee held public hearings around the country, which allowed many organisations, companies and individuals in the community to have their say on this important treaty. I welcome JSCOT's majority recommendation that binding treaty action be taken to implement the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The committee made a number of other recommendations regarding implementation of ChAFTA after entry into force, which the government will consider closely in due course.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The China agreement rounds out the third in a trifecta of trade agreements the government has concluded with our three largest export markets. Already Australian businesses are seeing the benefits of our agreements with Korea and China. Together these agreements have the potential to transform our economy, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, including 12 countries, covering 40 per cent of global GDP, promises to further enhance the competitiveness of our economy and deliver new markets and generate new jobs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it is important to note that this outcome was the best part of a decade in the making. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge the contributions made by my predecessors on both sides of the House. Negotiations commenced under the Howard government, when Mark Vaile was Minister for Trade. Mark Vaile was followed by Warren Truss, Simon Crean, Craig Emerson and Richard Marles, all of whom share in this outcome. Pleasingly, this demonstrates bipartisan support across successive Australian governments for our relationship with China. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge all of those officials and negotiators from my department who have dedicated so much time, effort and professionalism over a long period to help secure this outcome for Australia. After 10 years, it is rather a large alumni. It includes Jan Adams, who has provided outstanding leadership, along with her highly talented team. It includes our Ambassador to China, Frances Adamson, and her predecessors. I would also like to thank my own staff for their efforts, their great dedication and their great support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few holes in this Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and problems in this agreement, and I want to draw attention to one of them and seek to try to close it. That is a hole that exists regarding people being brought in to work in Australia, the conditions under which they do that and whether there are any limitations on it. Broadly speaking, there are two sets of ways in which people can be brought into Australia under this agreement and under our migration laws. One set that has been the subject of recent debate and discussion between Labor and Liberal and has been the focus of articles is around work agreements and large projects. But there is another stream that allows people to be brought into this country under these provisions and to work here, and that is through the usual standard business sponsor arrangement, where a business will sponsor someone to bring them in or potentially bring them in under subclass 400 visas—short-stay activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know under this agreement, because it is very clear in its terms, is that the starting point of this agreement in article 10.4(3) is that unless it is specified otherwise in the annexe—and I will come to the annexe in a moment—there will be no more labour market testing. This means the starting point is that you do not have to advertise locally for a job before you can bring someone in under this agreement. There have been some amendments reached between the government and the opposition about large-scale work agreements, project agreements and the like. What I want to do is try to close a loophole that exists with respect to a second set of people, and that is those that are referred to in the annexe and those that are called 'installers and servicers' or 'contractual service suppliers'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation is this: despite all of the agreements reached between Labor and the coalition, under this agreement, unless we amend it today, it will be possible for businesses in Australia to bring in an unlimited number of people to work in Australia without having to advertise locally first, provided that they call them either 'contractual service suppliers' or 'installers and servicers'. There are a number of other criteria that they would have to meet but they will not have to advertise locally first. If that loophole is not be closed, then all these other protections that have been negotiated are next to worthless, because there is now a separate way for businesses in this country to bring people in, provided that they call them 'contractual service suppliers' or 'installers and servicers', given that the opening words in 10.4(3) say that there is not going to be labour market testing for them anymore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing that this set of amendments does is to put into legislation one of the protections that has been supposedly negotiated. At the moment, when it comes to those larger-scale work agreements, the only protection that has been negotiated between the government and the opposition is to issue a new regulation. Everyone knows that what a minister regulates one day they can take away the next, and I for one am not prepared to put labour protection solely in the hands of a coalition workplace relations minister or a coalition immigration minister. Those protections ought to be in law. So the second component of these amendments is to put that protection about a party work agreement back into the front part of the legislation rather than in regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sensible set of amendments that will close the loophole. As I say, the way these trade deals are negotiated means that we are presented with 'take it or leave it', so you do not have the opportunity to amend the agreement itself, but we do have the opportunity to amend our migration laws. That is something that the minister has said he is going to do with respect to regulations, and so the proposal to this House is that the government and the opposition agree to close one further loophole. We say that you have not gone far enough, but in the way that you have indicated you want to do with project agreements and work agreements, let's do it as well with these other categories, these contractual service suppliers. If we do not close the loophole, it will mean that someone can come in and work as a nurse or an electrician without the job having to be advertised locally first, and they could do it for up to four years. That, I think, is something that most people would not agree with.</span>

It is also disappointing that the member has not sought a briefing, where we could have clarified in a matter of minutes those comments and serious misrepresentations. It has gone on for so long. It worried the Chinese in a way that should not be the case. Here is a country that feels so proud about the quality of this agreement—a country that feels it has demonstrated to the rest of the developed world that it can do a world-class agreement, a high-quality agreement across goods, services and investment—and about taking our relationship to a further level. We hear this parroting of misrepresentations again and again and again, creating fear in the community. It is unacceptable, I have got to say. It is about time, after months and months and months, that some responsibility was shown by everyone in this House. I just reject the comments that have been made by the member for Melbourne, and I do wish that he had bothered to come along and get a briefing. He would have found out that the misrepresentations that have been peddled by a bunch of union thugs are wrong and wrong and wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no case for the amendments that have been put by the member for Melbourne. I reject them out of hand. I would have been very grateful had the member for Melbourne took the time to come and find out the substance and the protections embodied in this agreement. At no stage did we move outside of the worker protections that currently exist as government policy—and existed under our predecessors, by the way—because we were determined that we would not have something that would create fear and concern amongst the Australian community. We went to great lengths to ensure that. But what did we get? Endless misrepresentation by the unions, and now the member for Melbourne is still perpetuating those misrepresentations. It is unacceptable. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is creating a great deal of confusion in China, and yet the member for Melbourne would be the first person to say that we should as a government be doing everything possible to build peace and stability in our region, especially with our major neighbours such as China. We have heard this misrepresentation, this fearmongering, this dog whistling, for months—serious dog whistling. The member from Melbourne should be ashamed of himself. I do feel that we all have to grow up in this chamber and recognise the things that are very important for our country. The opposition have been involved in negotiating this deal for 10 years, and I am very pleased that they have agreed to support this bill in a bipartisan way. I totally reject the amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  It seems that the era of reasoned debate in this place and judging issues on their merits did not last very long under the new leadership. The suggestion that we cannot have a reasoned debate about closing loopholes when that is exactly what the minister has just been doing with Labor for the last week is offensive. They want to have a debate about advertising locally, and the minister has just written a letter to the Labor Party, to Senator Penny Wong, saying he is prepared to discuss that in some respects. But when we get up and ask whether we can extend discussion to a couple of others matters all of a sudden there are claims of dog whistling—and that is offensive. The minister should know better; the minister should be bigger than that. We should be able in this place to have a reasoned debate. These are issues that we have been raising for some time. If the minister chooses only Labor as his dancing partner and says he will talk to them and chooses not to talk to other members of this parliament, that is a matter for the minister. But people have been raising these issues for some time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am putting forward what I believe are reasonable amendments based on a report from Dr Joanna Howe, senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide Law School, who has gone through this agreement and the amendments and said, 'This would be a sensible amendment to make.' I think we should have the right to come to this place and say, 'Well if you can change (a) and (b) in the agreement, we would like to change (c) as well' and not be accused of being offensive or being racist. That is just minimising the minister's standing and minimising the status of debate in this House. I am a member of an electorate that has a substantial Chinese community, and I have said at press conferences there are good things in this free trade agreement that should be supported, but what we do not like is the fact that when we come here and get told as a parliament take it or leave it—and the way treaties are discussed and negotiated means people like us and people who have genuine concerns never get a chance to input into them—it means we are left to come in and try to fix the holes at the last minute like this. We should be entitled to do so and we should be able to do so with respect. We should be able to do so in a dignified manner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When anyone in Australia says 'I just want a bit of analysis and I want to be sure that the safeguards are there,' it does not mean they are xenophobic. I and many in my electorate want more trade with our neighbouring partners and are happy to talk about how we do that. People just want to know that there will be protections there at the end of the day. When we come here asking for that we should be entitled to be treated with the respect that our constituents who are for globalisation but want it to be happening on terms that protect important parts of our way of life deserve. We should be entitled to be treated with dignity when we come and raise these matters.</span>

What disturbed me most was that the first thing he said when he stood up was that if you go and look at the chapter on the infrastructure facilitation agreements it says that you do not need labour market testing. Over months of debate I and others have sought to answer many questions in all sorts of forums, in many speeches, and that has been the key misrepresentation by the unions from day one.</span>

                    </a>  I did not interrupt you; if you listen you might form a different view. That one key misrepresentation has become a lightning rod. Everyone knows, with three minutes of investigation, that the signing of the infrastructure facilitation agreement at the start of a project in no way changes the need for labour market testing when the project starts. Why would you have labour market testing two years before the project starts? You do not even know what labour is necessary at that stage. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Melbourne perpetuated this myth with his first comments when he stood up, and that is what irritates me. This debate has been going on for months and months and months and these misrepresentations have been going on, and you have not bothered once to come and get some clarity. I would have given you any amount of contact with the department, whatever you wanted. You have taken the view of one person with a particular reputation in this area from an Adelaide university and that is the basis of your argument. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have responsibilities in this place, and one is to do the best job we can to inform ourselves before we jump to our feet—not to come in and, with weasel words, continue to raise fabricated concerns that have been perpetuated by $10 million to $12 million worth of advertising by the union movement. I say to the member for Melbourne: if we want to have a reasoned debate, and I agree that is very much the case, then we need to be as informed as possible and, if we have queries, take the opportunity to walk down the corridor and say, 'I'd like a meeting.' And you will get it every time. You will get it. This is such an important issue that I talk to anyone and everyone to try and inform people of the detail.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we have not changed our agreement with the Labor Party. Again, this is sleight of hand or maybe a misunderstanding. The fact of the matter is that not one word, not one commitment, not one element of the agreement, the MOU or the side letter has been changed—none of it. It is as it was signed off on in June. None of it has changed. What we have done is provided an assurance to the Labor Party that what is already in the agreement will continue to be in the agreement, that it will not be changed by government fiat some years down the track. If it is to be changed, it will go as a regulation before the parliament and it will then be allowed or disallowed by the parliament. That is an assurance that what we have agreed, the worker protections that are in there, are satisfactory and there is no reason for people to fear for their jobs or their salary levels, or to fear that cheap labour will come in. As I said to you earlier, Member for Bandt, nothing has changed, absolutely nothing. But in an act of good faith, with goodwill on both sides, we have sought to provide the assurances that the Labor Party needed—that what is in the agreement, which they accept, is not to be changed but is binding on our government or any government, for that matter, unless there are changes put to the chambers as regulation for approval or disapproval.</span>

Firstly, as well as a number of other issues, this is something that our relevant spokesperson has been pursuing in the Senate since day one, so this ought to come as no news to anyone—because we have been pursuing it with the department, pursuing it with everyone. Secondly, I heard what the minister said about IFAs in his opening words, and the scare campaigns, as he calls them. The minister may not have heard what I said in my opening words: I am not talking about those. I am talking about the other stream of visas, apart from IFAs, and the fact that that is not dealt with in any of the matters that have been traversed with the Labor Party in their agreement. I take it from what the minister says that there is an acceptance that I am right—that the holes that are there with respect to non-IFAs, just the ordinary stream of visas, still remain and are not dealt with in the exchange of letters.</span>

If that sort of logic is going to prevail, so be it. As I said, I think the best thing would be for the member for Melbourne to come and avail himself of some information about what is and what is not in the agreement, how it will work and how binding it is. This agreement is a rolled gold, rock-solid agreement which will protect workers, protect their jobs and protect their salary levels. In fact, it is going to create tens of thousands of jobs in the years ahead. Perpetuating this sort of fear campaign—and that is what it is, to be brutal about it—continues to create uncertainty and to undermine the confidence that is being generated daily by this agreement. It just detracts from the opportunities that are there for the taking and from which all Australians can benefit.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  The coalition is today providing better support for young Australians by amending the means test for youth payments. As many parents, students and teachers in rural communities across the country will know, these tests have been a barrier to higher education for our kids. At last, our students will be the beneficiaries of common sense changes to youth allowance in order to let them be judged on their merits and not on their ability to pay. Education must be about the books not the bills—for students and parents. The system, as it stands, has prevented hundreds of young people from accessing payments and kept others from receiving the support they need. Whether through an adverse assessment of the family actual means test or the family assets test, some students are being left out in the cold in terms of the support that they are eligible for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Social Services Legislation Amendment (More Generous Means Testing for Youth Payments) Bill 2015 will change the lives of hundreds of families living in rural communities in three key ways: (1) it will mean that the family farm is no longer included in the application for youth allowance; (2) families will no longer have other children kept out of means test and thereby make other children ineligible or eligible for less; and (3) it will mean that, when they do gain access to their youth allowance, students will benefit from a higher rate. For rural and regional families, supporting a child in further education is expensive. It often means that the child has to move away to university or to a TAFE to learn a trade. These young Australians cannot just nip home for lunch or to do a load of washing. The cost of living is something that they face up-front and in full. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider this, as we are nearly at the time of VCE exams: a student who is currently studying at a college in Wannon will no doubt take some well-earned rest after the gruelling experience of year 12. If they have done well and kept their head down, they might get into their preferred university in Melbourne or Geelong, some distance away from home. But these offers will only be sent out in January with classes starting in February. This gives our country student a month—maybe six weeks—to move their life to a brand new city. While some students their age will be making the same move out of home, few will be doing it hours of travel away in a different city. They have to pay rent, they have to try to find part-time work, they have to be able to try to get home and they have to do it between getting an offer in January and sitting down to their first class in February. All of these costs—rent, fuel et cetera—add up for these young Australians. Providing youth allowance to these people is incredibly important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If our young students from rural areas are to be given the kinds of opportunities provided to those in the city, common sense must be applied to the challenges that face them. If we want to give our students the best start we can give them, with an equal opportunity for rural students, these measures will be passed. To the year 12s currently studying for their final exams at the end of this month I say good luck, but I also say that we will be with you when you are done. This bill will be with those students, if we can pass it this year—with the effects taking place on 1 January 2016. They are working hard for our future, so let us work hard for theirs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Warrnambool, in my electorate, we recently held a forum to discuss the challenges to accessing higher education for rural communities. I was joined by Senator Bridget McKenzie and representatives from the Department of Education and Training and the Department of Social Services in engaging with students, parents and teachers on this issue. The overwhelming view was that there are significant financial barriers to accessing further education for school leavers from rural and regional areas. I take a moment to thank Senator Bridget McKenzie for the work that she has done in highlighting this issue and conducting forums across the country, making sure that students, their parents and communities have had the ability to have a say on this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At that Warrnambool forum, Rural Industries Skill Training Chief Executive, Bill Hamill, told the hearing that living away from home expenses concerned regional parents more than the fees to go to university. Very simply: the cost put on these students is far greater than those on their city counterparts. In relation to another major aspect to these changes—the dependency on parents after school—passing these changes will see fewer students having to rely on parents to pay for these living away from home expenses. Again, education should be about books not bills. It is particularly important for those parents who will, at stages in their lives, be dealing with this issue not just for one child but will sometimes have three or more children in higher education at the one time. In putting forward this legislation, the coalition government is doing just that. We are cutting regulation and red tape out of the support system for students and parents. By removing the family assets test, for example, around 4,100 more students will become eligible for youth allowance payments for the first time. This will mean each of these young people will on average get an extra $7,000 each year to help with their cost of living. This is a significant increase which will mean that their ability to focus on their books rather than on their bills will be the dominant theme of what they do throughout the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This money can go towards paying bills, getting home to see family and buying all the things that are needed to take up a trade or a degree. Education is so important, and this will help in this regard. Each one of these 4,100 students already knows that this is what their time studying should be focused on, and now their government, thanks to the coalition government, knows it too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also change parental income tests in relation to applying for youth allowance. Making this system more common sense and including all family tax benefit children in the family pool will mean that 13,700 families will have children who will become eligible for around $1,100 more in their payments each year. Around 5,800 families who currently miss out on payments due to the combined higher taper rates will also become eligible for an average payment of around $1,300. The coalition government's common sense has meant that families and students will benefit from these changes and these benefits will be felt strongest in rural communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not underestimate the importance of this move. Sure, it is not exactly where we want to be when it comes to ensuring that students have the ability to know what, if they want to pursue tertiary education, they can do so in a way where the cost burden on them or their families will not be a consideration in whether they should go on to tertiary education. This bill helps get us part way down the path. I must congratulate and thank the former minister for social security for the way that he consulted with members from regional and rural communities in bringing about these changes. Both he and his office were prepared to engage, listen and take advice from those members in regional and rural communities for whom this issue is significant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only through that listening that we have got to where we are, but it will require us seeing how these changes work, looking and learning from them and then looking at other aspects. For instance, there are still some anomalies for those who defer to get independent youth allowance and the time frame for which they have to defer, which means that in some cases they are better off deferring for two years rather than one year before they take up tertiary studies. We all know from the statistics that, the longer they defer, the larger the percentage that will not go on to do tertiary education. While taking a gap year is one way of overcoming the expenses of relocating to get to tertiary education, sadly, it also means that we lose people from getting a tertiary degree. As we have seen from the previous bill that just went through the parliament—the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement—for us to capitalise on agreements like that, we need to be able to do so across the board, whether it is in the services sector, the agriculture sector, the manufacturing sector or the mining sector. In particular, when it comes to the education sector, we have to make sure that our students right across this great nation are all getting the type of tertiary education that they deserve and that cost is not a factor in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude by thanking all the people in my electorate of Wannon who have made submissions to me, who have written to me, who have campaigned for change in this area, who have not let go of their campaign to ensure that there is greater fairness and social justice in ensuring that people across the board can get access to tertiary education. I have had letters from families pointing out how they have had to make significant sacrifices to get their children to tertiary studies. I have heard other stories of families having to sit down with their kids and explain to them that their financial circumstances mean that they will have to defer, work and get the money themselves if they want to go on to tertiary studies. Students have said to me how they would have liked to be able to return home more often to see family but the cost of fuel or the cost involved in getting home has meant that, whereas they would have loved to get home every couple of months, they are restricted to doing it every three to six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That community feedback has meant that my passion to see change in this issue has grown from day 1—grown since that dreadful time when the previous Labor government first made those shameful changes discriminating against country students some six years ago. This bill goes part way to addressing that, and I commend and congratulate all the regional and rural MPs, both National and Liberal, on the coalition side who have worked in unison to make sure that we have got the outcome that we have got before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring that our young students have the choice to get to tertiary education is something which is vital to the future of this nation. We have to ensure that our children are going to have the skills and the education to set them up for life in a globalised world in the 21st century. Our businesses are not just competing across state boundaries and communities; they are competing now across the globe. We have to make sure that we are innovative. We have to make sure that we are agile. Above all else, we have to make sure that our students have the education they need to ensure they will succeed in the coming years.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOHN COBB</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  Today I rise with pleasure to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (More Generous Means Testing for Youth Payments) Bill 2015. I welcome the introduction of this bill to the House as it will, as it says, mean a more generous and consistent system of assessment for families with dependent young people who qualify for a variety of youth income support payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my responsibility is primarily to regional and rural farming families, I would like to focus on the benefits of this bill for them. The reform will remove the family assets test and the family actual means test from the youth allowance parental means test arrangements. It will align parental income test exemptions for youth allowance with existing arrangements for family tax benefit part A and it will remove maintenance income from the youth allowance parental income test. It is extraordinarily important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes will come into effect from the beginning of next year—in other words, at the beginning of the next education year. At the start of 2017, a separate maintenance support income test for the treatment of child support like that currently applying to family tax benefit part A will be brought in. From July 2016, where a family has a dependent child who receives an individual youth payment that is parentally income tested and younger siblings who qualify for the family tax benefit, the family pool for the youth parental income test will include all FTB-eligible children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to higher education is one of those obvious areas wherein the further away you live from everyone else the more disadvantaged who are. I am the first person to put my hand up and say, 'If you want everything you can get in a city then do not come out and live where we are.' But, where possible, we do have to give an opportunity to those who are in isolated areas to have an education. While I accept that we have a far better lifestyle in regional Australia and an awful lot of advantages, obviously education and health can be—and I stress 'can be'—somewhat disadvantaged. While that will always be the case and cannot be avoided, I think we have a duty, as much as is reasonable and possible, to improve that access and make it less onerous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will particularly benefit our rural and regional families whose children are looking to continue studying beyond year 12. At the moment, some young people coming from farming families are missing out on youth allowance due to the asset testing currently in place. It makes the decision to go to university a tough one for many young people as in almost all cases they would have to move away from home. It can be very expensive and it can be very difficult to find a job quickly, especially in some university towns where there are obviously a lot of students competing for jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the family assets test youth allowance will allow around 4,100 additional payments. This will be the first time these young people will qualify for annual payments of around $7,000. As somebody who was involved in the education of seven children, I can tell you that they can do a lot with $7,000. Young people in the bush deserve a fair go. I hesitate to say we deserve the same access to education as our metropolitan counterparts, but we do need the encouragement and, as much as possible, the assistance of government and the taxpayer to get that access. This bill ensures that, in large part, that access can become available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 1,200 more young people will be receiving youth allowance for the first time. As well, we will be increasing payments for around 5,000 existing students by about $2,000 a year. These changes mean rural and regional farming families will not have their assets counted towards the means test of their dependent children. This is a practical measure as the assets of farming families and others are not always a good representation of their income. As somebody who has depended upon agriculture my whole life and who probably will for the rest of it, I can tell you that farming families are capital bound and income poor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are already of a lot of pressures in rural and regional areas. Things like drought and isolation prove huge hurdles. The bill will at least help remove one of those challenges by allowing a younger regional person to choose if higher education is what they need or want. These young people should not be prevented from achieving their potential on account of the privilege of being born in the bush. They have a huge amount to contribute to our nation, and they do. If there is one thing that people in remote areas do it is contribute to the nation way above their weight. There are not many of them, but they produce a heck of a lot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an investment in Australia's future, and it is particularly an investment in Australia's future for those in our society who do populate rural, remote and regional Australia and who we want to keep doing that. Let them go and get educated, learn their skills and then go back out to where we need them. Let then use that extra knowledge and experience to be even greater contributors to Australia than they currently are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to represent those people. My original electorate has some of the most remote places in Australia attached to it. It looks like the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton, is going to pinch all that country soon. If he does, I know he will be just as proud of that part of the world as I have always been. It is just magnificent to be out at Tibooburra and go and see the School of the Air situated in the most remote town in New South Wales. It has got 150 people—it has got two pubs, though. We do need people from that part of the world to go to Sydney to get an education and go back out there and make Tibooburra an even better place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  Education plays an integral role, a vital role, a crucial role in developing vibrant and sustainable regional communities. It is absolutely critical that we get everything right with education, and certainly the Social Services Legislation Amendment (More Generous Means Testing for Youth Payments) Bill 2015 goes part of the way towards doing that. Of course, there are so many other things that we need to do as far as education is concerned, and we, the Turnbull-Truss government, are getting on with the job of doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to educational opportunities increases, lifts and raises the aspirations of young people and of regional communities. It is an individual thing; it is a collective thing. There is a significant divide between rural and regional students and metropolitan students, and it is not just the Great Dividing Range. It is not just that great sandstone curtain that divides the Sydney-Wollongong-Newcastle metropolitan areas from the rest of New South Wales. There is a significant divide between country folk and their metropolitan cousins. Rural and regional communities have long suffered the consequences—economically, educationally and socially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures are alarming when it comes to education.    Only 17 per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds from regional areas have a bachelor's degree or higher qualification, compared with 36 per cent from the same age group who live in the capital cities—those who live within those big city lights. In remote areas, that figure is only 15.4 per cent. We just heard from the member for Calare, who has fiercely represented many of those remote areas. He mentioned the member for Parkes, who also has. When you look at the proposed boundaries for Parkes under last week's Australian Electoral Commission redistribution, he will be representing more than 400,000 square kilometres. If it were a country, Parkes would be the 60th largest in the world under the new boundaries. So he will represent—and has represented in the past—many remote students very well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A student from regional Australia has only a 33 per cent chance of attending university, compared to a 55 per cent chance for students from major metropolitan areas. I see the member for Rankin is nodding. He understands. He gets it. As Australians, we all understand the tyranny of distance in modern society, but its significance has not been replicated across policy. Distance has created the significant divide between capital cities and regional Australia, resulting in what I would argue are policy inequalities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals, both in opposition and in government, have been working hard to bridge the gap and to maintain a strong voice, as they always have, advocating in the best interests of regional young people, because that is what we do as National Party members, whether we are sitting on the opposition benches or whether we are, indeed, sitting on the government benches and are able to help formulate policy and help with the financing aspect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Fiona Nash has led the charge for years. With all due respect to my colleague opposite, I have to say, against Labor, that in the past government they made it extremely difficult and unfair for regional students to access youth allowance. This was due to the changes that were made during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. Regional students struggled immensely in those six years to afford tertiary education because of what I would argue, what I would say and what I rightly believe were unfair changes made to independent youth allowance. It demonstrates how completely out of touch Labor was with regional communities in those six years between 2007 and 2013. A sustained campaign led by regional communities and the Nationals in coalition eventually forced a Labor government backflip.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Riverina, access to youth allowance can be the determining factor for students and their families—and we have to include families in this because it is not just about the student. It is also about the cost that it brings to bear on what are often farming families, on what often are families with small businesses. Sometimes, under what were Labor's unfair policies, it meant that only one student from a family was able to go to university. The family was only able to afford one. Students need to be able to pursue a tertiary education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have three children. Georgina, who is now a secondary high school teacher at Griffith, was fortunate. She studied at Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga and was able to live at home. Alexander, who is an accountant, is studying a course at the moment through Charles Sturt University. My and Catherine's youngest son, Nicholas, is doing an electrical apprenticeship next year, and I have always argued and always will argue that a trade certificate is every bit equal to a diploma or a degree. My children were fortunate that they were able to stay at home, but many country students do not have the good fortune to be able to do the courses that they want to do in their home town and therefore are forced to go elsewhere and to work many, many hours doing a job to help pay their way. It creates good time management skills but it also creates hardship for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals recognise and understand there is a serious inequity which exists between regional and metropolitan students when it comes to accessing tertiary education, hence this bill before the parliament this afternoon. It costs between $15,000 and $20,000 a year to send a child away to a university or college of technical and further education, a cost which is greatly experienced on far more occasions by families living in regional Australia, outside of those bright city lights. The Nationals have been fighting hard for the establishment of a tertiary access allowance, a policy we developed prior to the last election. This proposal was designed to directly assist regional families and students needing to relocate significant distances to undertake tertiary studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past three months, the Chair of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, Victorian Senator Bridget McKenzie, has been travelling to all corners of regional Australia to host regional higher education forums to discuss the barriers that regional, rural and remote students face when accessing higher education. The 20 or so forums that Senator McKenzie has held across the country will provide—and have provided—innovative ideas and inform policy going forward to better support students from regional and remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 July I held a forum at Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga with students, teachers, lecturers, career advisers and parents to discuss regional barriers our local students face. The media turned up as well, which was good because it meant that the awareness message was able to get out there. The common theme from the Wagga Wagga forum was the financial barriers regional students face when pursuing a tertiary education. I am pleased to say that the measures contained in this bill will help to alleviate and address some of the concerns and issues raised on that day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals in government will continue to    push for equity and fairness for regional students. In coalition negotiations, Prime Minister Turnbull made the commitment to Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Nationals Warren Truss to implement a plan to address the financial barriers regional students face in pursuing higher education pathways. This is very important. It is a huge win for regional students and families and a direct result of the Nationals delivering a strong voice for regional Australia in the coalition, as we have always done and as we will continue to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget, in May this year, the coalition announced the measures contained in this bill to assist families and to encourage more young people, particularly from rural, regional and remote Australia, into further study. Students from asset-rich but cash-poor farming families will be more than $7,000 a year better off following the removal of the family assets test when considering eligibility for youth allowance. That is important because some of these rural, regional and remote families might be asset rich but, particularly in north-west New South Wales and southern Queensland, they have been in drought conditions for four years, and that was after only a couple of years of good seasons, preceded by a decade or more of the Millennium Drought. So they have had tough times for going on 14 of the past 16 years. When they are asset rich but cash poor, it is a bit difficult to send young Johnny or young Mary off to university for a better future, for that tertiary degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For farming families and small businesses across the country, this removal of the family assets test will mean the value of farms and trusts will no longer be considered when people apply for youth allowance. That is an important measure. It will benefit around 4,100 dependent young people who will qualify for youth allowance. That is 4,100 young people who are going to get access to a better future and possibly a better life because of this legislation. This is a game changer for many young people, who will now qualify for the very first time. It is a positive change for the families in the regions who have for far too long been disadvantaged due to the application of the family assets test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been the member for Riverina since 2010, following Kay Hull, a strident advocate for a fairer deal for young students. I know how great a priority she placed on this. I see the member for Forrest up the back, ready to speak, and she knows how important this is, because she attended the meetings that I attended when we discussed this with the relevant ministers. When it comes to this issue, she has been a strident advocate for fairer measures for many, many years, and I know she will continue to be a great advocate for young students in her regional area in Western Australia. Mrs Hull told me of the importance of this. I always knew how important it would be, but the number of phone calls, letters and emails that my electorate office received when I became the member for Riverina in 2010 and the number of people who pulled me up in Wagga Wagga, Griffith, West Wyalong, Tumbarumba, or wherever I went throughout my electorate, showed that this was an issue that was so important to people. I am glad that this legislation is before the House today so that we can do something positive about it. It is a positive change for families in the region. They have been far too long disadvantaged by the application of the family assets test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the removal of both the family assets test and the family actual means test from the youth allowance parental income test, the assessment of a young person's access to youth allowance will be based on a fairer measure of family income. Simplifying the parental means test will provide additional assistance for farming families—and all those others in regional areas too; they are not just farming families. Regional Australia is transforming, but farming families and small business are the great drivers of regional Australia. This is making the system fairer for students who need the support the most. Treating the family farm or business as income is illogical. Many farming families have significant assets on paper, but this does not translate to the bank balance. It is the same for small business, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly. You know that, coming from the electorate of Hughes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When a farmer's son or daughter is accepted into university, the cash-poor farmer cannot just sell half a paddock or hock the tractor to fully fund the extent of relocating their children to attend university. That is why it is important that the measures in this bill are implemented. They will greatly benefit young people and make a difference to families who the face geographic challenges of living and working in rural and regional Australia. I commend the work of the regional coalition MPs for the development of these measures. The government is doing what it can to lift higher education participation rates in country areas and allow regional students to be more competitive with students in the capital cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is concerning that, of the one-third of the Australian population living in regional Australia, only 21 per cent make up Australia's university population. We need to change that and this bill will help. There is still a lot of hard work to undertake to close the gap between regional and city students. We must continue to work hard—I know the member for Forrest will—to increase participation rates in tertiary education and to address the unique challenges facing regional students. The removal of the Family Assets Test as well as the decision to remove the Family Actual Means Test are positive first steps in making the system fairer for regional and rural young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the work done by Senators Nash and McKenzie, the member for Gippsland and others. The Nationals will continue to fight for fairness and deliver positive outcomes for young people across regional Australia in this parliament.</span>

It is not the ultimate solution, as we have heard from other speakers, for all of the issues surrounding the provision of support for students throughout rural and regional Australia, but it is a step along the way. It is another step made by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that is really critical. Other members and the previous speak spoke very eloquently about the demand for this in our rural and regional communities. There is no question that, when I travel throughout my electorate, it is one of the most common issues that families and young people talk to me about. In fact, only last week I was at Cape Naturaliste College and that was the issue that the staff and students were wanting to know most about. As members know, prior to coming into this place, this was an issue that I was working very hard on because it is so important. Young people in rural and regional areas really need the opportunities to carry on and, not only follow their dreams, but to gain the skills and the education they need to come back to our rural and regional communities and help those communities grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a battle of regional MPs on this side of the House for as long as I have been in this place. It was my motion, on 28 October 2010, which called on the then Labor government to reverse its decision to discriminate against regional students in the changes that they had enacted, and they were discriminatory changes. Members on this side could not simply sit back and allow that to continue. The motion that I put was the first defeat on the floor of the House for an incumbent government for a long, long time and represented, I thought, a low point for Labor when they were in government. Labor had, as it is so prone to do, disadvantaged regional Australian families and students to by diverting funds meant for Youth Allowance into outer metropolitan seats that they thought were Labor strongholds in which they were desperate to find an electoral advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a two-year campaign in 2010 and 2011 to right the disgraceful discrimination that the previous Labor government had arbitrarily inflicted on students and their families, the Labor government were then shamed into making some changes. It was clear that what they had done was affecting rural and regional students and their families in a dreadful way. I met so many young people who had changed what they were planning to do with their futures. There were young people who did not bother to pursue their higher education dreams because they knew that their family could not afford to keep them in a metropolitan area to pursue their education. It was tragic. The one thing we have never been able to calculate was how many of those young people had to take an alternative pathway or never pursued their higher education dreams. That really, really hurt me at the time. I met parents in supermarkets who were literally crying: 'My husband and I have both taken a second job. We can't do any more, but we still can't afford for our young people to go onto higher education.' We need to encourage these great young people. They have every right to pursue higher education and go onto whatever it is that they are best suited for and want to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government changed the rules in 2012 so that students described as 'inner regional' and 'outer regional' would be treated equally in applying for independent Youth Allowance. On the surface that sounds good, but in reality 'treated equally' probably means 'treated equally badly'. The Labor government told the Australian community that they would end their discrimination, but hid another slap in the face for students and parents by dumping the 'independent' part of the independent Youth Allowance. Students are classified as 'independent' but they are not dependent on people, including their parents, but the Labor government added a Parental Means Test to a student classified as 'independent'. Many students look to take a gap year to earn enough money to be considered independent. It especially applies to regional students, the vast majority of whom have no choice but to move away from home to pursue their higher education studies. They have boarding costs, accommodation costs, of tens of thousands of dollars. They are the sorts of costs that metropolitan students who live at home do not have to worry about and neither do their families. It is a massive impost on rural and regional families that metropolitan families simply do not have to face, which is something unfortunately that the Labor government repeatedly ignored; they ignored our kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the stories over and over about families wondering if they could afford to send their children to tertiary education. The most heartbreaking thing was the families who said to me, particularly when they had more than one child, that they had to decide which one of their children they could actually afford to send on to university. Parents said, 'We actually have to choose which one of our kids can go to university.' That is a heartbreaking choice for any parent. Equally, it is a heartbreaking choice for a child who knows their family cannot afford to send them and they say to mum and dad, 'No, mum and dad, I'm actually going to do other things. I'm not even going to try. I'm going to take a different pathway, go on to do VET or go to work.' That is exactly what happens. That was really a tough time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The payment of youth allowance is subject to an assets test. Youth allowance is not payable to a person if the assets test applies to the person and the value of the person's assets if that is more than the value limit. From January 1 2016, the assets test under part 2.11, division 2, subdivision AB will not apply to non-dependent young people. This is really an interesting thing: 'non-independent' is an interesting way of saying 'dependent'. Dependent youth allowance recipients will no longer be assets tested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the family assets test will allow around 4,100 additional dependent youth allowance young people to qualify for the first time. Can you imagine what this means to those young people? It is the first time for their family. They are going the opportunity that they otherwise would not have had. That is for 4,100 young people—how awesome is that? That is a great result. They will be able to access annual payments of more than $7,000 a year, meaning that small business families and farming families will not have their assets counted towards the means test for their children claiming youth allowance. It is an important reform and a step in the right direction. But it is for dependent—that is, non-independent—youth allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes also impact on the income test component of youth allowance for a small section of the community. From 2016, there will be no parental income test exemption for young people with a parent who is receiving a New Enterprise Incentive Scheme Commonwealth allowance or qualifies for a low-income healthcare card. The proportion of young people living in regional areas in this category who are seeking to study is not necessarily really high, but 4,100 young people is a great result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the family actual means test will see around 1,200 more young people receiving youth allowance for the first time, as well as increasing payments for around 4,860 existing students by approximately $2,000 a year. In addition, the changes will remove maintenance such as child support from the income test equation and step 3 of the parental income test involves working out the person's combined parental income. There are other changes in this particular bill. They are all particularly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I wanted to go back to is that around 5,800 families, who currently miss out on payments due to the combined higher taper rates, will also become eligible for an average payment of around $1,300 a year. With a commitment from the government of $262.7 million over the forward estimates, this bill will bring extra support to thousands of families in various ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But as I said earlier, I am sure that rural and regional members' offices—and there several of those members in the chamber now, such as the member for Corangamite—would be the same. They would have the same issues in their electorates of young people who are desperate to go onto higher education but whose families are in a situation where they simply cannot afford for that to happen. I see that we have other local members from Western Australia as well in this place. Equally, right around the large state of WA, this is a common issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to understand is that we have got a lot of great young people and they do want the opportunity to go on to higher education, but they find it particularly difficult. Accommodation costs are only one part. The other things that I would mention are some of the challenges of living away from home. It can be particularly difficult for young people who head off to the city for the first time. They do need support when they are actually living away from home. If you are a student who lives with mum and dad at home, you live in a metropolitan or urban area and you are having a tough day, when you come home you can let off steam and you can find support because the people around you love you. They will put up with you saying some pretty harsh things if you are really under pressure because of your exams. I see the new member for Canning here. He will also have young people affected by this issue of youth allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the students come home, if it is their family they are coming home to, then they are going to have someone to listen to them and to support them. When they are living away from home, this also is not necessarily easiest for them because the people around them are other students. They might be people completely not related to them. They do not have that same opportunity for support. There are a number of issues that face young people who come from rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have thought long and hard on this. I had a group of people from my electorate who came to a meeting with the two departments and actually talked about the major issues facing them with youth allowance. The debate is the same; it is ongoing. I will keep fighting on this. Yes, this is a step. But just as we said earlier, it is the first step and an ongoing step. I will continue my fight for rural and regional students right around Australia who have to move away from home to pursue their higher education dreams.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  The new Prime Minister claims that he has fixed the NBN, but that is a myth. Let's have a look at the scoreboard. The cost of his second-rate NBN is up. He promised he could build it for $29½ billion; it is now up to $56 billion. It has almost doubled. The time that it will take to build this second-rate network is also up. It said he would build it by the end of 2016. It is now going to take until the end of 2020, so the time has more than doubled. But the financial return for taxpayers has gone down. He promised it would be 5.3 per cent; now it has gone to as low as 2.7 per cent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we found out that this new Prime Minister, to make this second-rate network work, has bought almost 2,000 kilometres of new copper—enough copper to connect to Australia to New Zealand. Welcome to the 21st century!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this more in sorrow than in anger because I know the Prime Minister well and the people of Australia have high hopes and high expectations of him. They want him to succeed as Prime Minister, but they wanted him to succeed as communications minister as well and he let them down. He has failed them. He has not fixed the NBN. If he has fixed the NBN, he has done about as good a job as the 'fixer' Christopher Pyne did at fixing education— and we know just how good a job Christopher Pyne has done.</span>

I would like to congratulate John Bowler, who was elected convincingly as Mayor of Kalgoorlie; Dennis Wellington, who was easily re-elected as Mayor of the City of Albany; and Victoria Brown, who was elected as President of the Shire of Esperance.</span>

Of course, councils have their own responsibilities for planning, roads, parks, tourism, development and attracting investment. I again congratulate those elected representatives who were successful on Saturday, commiserate with those who were defeated and thank those individuals who put their best foot forward to serve their local communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  The Prime Minister of this country wants us to think he is some kind of technology guru at the same time as he builds an NBN out of old 2c coins. When you go to the detail of his second-rate NBN, as the member for Blaxland did a moment ago, you see it is half as good for twice the cost. For many people in my community, the Prime Minister's stewardship of that portfolio has meant a much longer wait. They said it would be faster and cheaper and finished by 2016, and all those promises have turned to dust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In different circumstances people in my community would have welcomed the announcement on Friday that there were some suburbs from my area added to the list, but my community knows better. They are not mugs. They have been let down before. They were told before the election that everyone would have it by the end of 2016. Now they have a much longer wait. They were told that two-thirds of the 58,000 homes in my electorate would be connected; two-thirds of those 58,000 were wiped off the map.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of them see this new plan, as we do, as a plan for the election and not a plan for the construction of a first-rate NBN. After all the delays and all the disappointments, we are now supposed to believe that they will connect more than half the country in just two years, but only if it starts after the election. We had a forum in my community with the member for Blaxland. We heard lots of concern from people who just want one thing from this government—a first-rate, first-class NBN for my community, like you promised.</span>

These shows demonstrated that the community and volunteer spirit is alive and well in my electorate of Canning, and I would like to thank the following people for their continued commitment to ensuring these events are a great success. Firstly, there is President of the Hills Orchard Improvement Group, Bruno DelSimone, who alongside his committee put together the 32nd Karragullen Expo. It was a fantastic day and I was privileged to be able to present a number of awards at the event and recognise the contributions of the wider Hills community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there is President of the Waroona Agricultural Society, Mr Eric Walmsley, and Mr Peter Ward, who were kind enough to give me a personal tour of everything the Waroona Show had on offer. Special mentions go to 2015 rural ambassador Kirstin Waller, who is an excellent role model and a fine example of the rural work ethic, and Lisa Gliddon, who took out first prize in open decorated cakes with an amazing tribute to our ANZACs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the President of the Kelmscott Agricultural Society, Mr Vaughan James, also provided a personal tour at the show. I had the opportunity to see a number of exhibitors. However, a special mention goes to Craig Alford from Armadale Mower World and founder of Ride to the Other Side, who I am proud to be able to continue to support in his fundraising efforts for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and Australian Rotary Health's mental illness research. Congratulations to all who contributed.</span>

Rebecca has been involved in the Elephant Youth Day, a day held at Wodonga's La Trobe University on 15 October, organised by the Wodonga Youth Leadership Program, a team of four leaders who work closely with five Wodonga high school students who are in year 11. They formed a subcommittee to create an event for students in Wodonga schools in years 9 to 11.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day consisted of four guest speakers talking about their personal life experiences to inspire the students to live with a happier, healthier mind. They equipped the attendees with the skills to cope with their up-and-coming VCE pressure or other pressure in general with being an adolescent. These young people will create a domino effect on the people who they influence, which, I believe, is the beginning of creating a great generation of leaders in Indi.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate the committee team—Rebecca, Quin, Brody, Ariel, Hannah, Jacqui, Lendel, Lindsey and Caitlyn—for their dedication in creating and planning the event for two months, with a total attendance of over 60 students from Wodonga Senior Secondary College, Victory Lutheran College, Catholic College Wodonga and Wodonga Middle Years College. I would really like to congratulate the committee on strengthening and uniting the Indi community of Wodonga. It is young people like these who will be our future leaders and they will place the breadcrumb trail to make finding the way a little bit clearer. In Indi, events such as this one make a huge— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

With my trusty stock steed Whiskey, I joined the marchers in Wallendbeen and Goulburn, having a great day riding. I also had the pleasure in attending the Breadalbane, Bundanoon and Thirlmere events—all with a great sense of pride. I know from speaking to many people who came to watch or take part in this event that this pride was shared right across the community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is 100 years since the original Kangaroo March took place. The re-enactment was not about glorifying war; it was about remembering those sacrifices, to learn from them, to help new generations learn of their history and to help them to understand the issues that shaped us as the nation we are today. Importantly, residents along the route learned something more of their collective past.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second-rate NBN that the Liberal government is offering is more expensive and relies primarily on outdated copper. Instead of future-proofing the country and rolling out fibre-optic cable in areas where the existing copper is in bad shape, the Turnbull government goes out and buys more copper. The 1,800 kilometres of copper that nbn co has purchased will last about five months. And what happens after that, no-one knows. They do not even know!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At estimates the other night, nbn co admitted that they would need to purchase more copper but there would not be enough manufactured to date. According to nbn co, the committee should not worry about this because, 'It won't affect the rollout. It's a supply issue. It's something that we'll deal with.' Well, let us hope they can deal with it, because there is not a lot that they appear to know. They do not know how much of the existing copper network needs to be replaced, and they do not know whether the amount of copper they need will be available to buy. But the Australian public is being told that this will not affect the rollout at all. It is a shambles.</span>

Talk about a shocking example of cart before the horse! This government is a joke when it comes to the NBN, and it needs to restore Labor's original plan.</span>

That issue is the contamination of perfluorooctane sulfonate which has leached across all the way from Fullerton Cove through to the Tilligerry Creek.</span>

What needs to be addressed are health issues and water bore sampling, and, importantly, the mental health issues which are exacerbated for those whose incomes have been stopped, whether they are commercial fishermen or those who produce chickens, eggs or beef. All have been stopped from earning their income by this contaminant. So I say to the Department of Defence: listen to what is being said by all sides of politics, because all sides of politics at one time or another have been responsible for this issue. It is not a political issue; it is bureaucratic bungling. The government needs to step up to the plate. I met with the Prime Minister on Tuesday night. I met briefly with the Minister for Defence. More needs to be done. We just cannot keep playing the waiting game and exacerbate the situation for those who have lost their income. More work needs to be done and there needs to be better coordination, but, importantly, relieving the stress for those who have lost their income must be a matter of priority for this government, because it is not the fault of those people that they have lost their income due to this contamination.</span>

If that recommendation is accepted, it will ensure that steel continues to be made in my electorate at Port Kembla, the biggest steel producer in Australia. Over the last two months, the unions and management of BlueScope have worked hard to secure the savings which will ensure the productivity and the future viability of BlueScope. I know that I speak on behalf of all MPs, particularly all Labor MPs—in fact, all parliamentarians—when I say: quite clearly, the entire parliament is calling on the board and the chairman of BlueScope to do the right thing. We can continue to make steel in this country, we can continue to be a steel manufacturing nation, but we need the backing of the board.</span>

He put in place a four-point plan which included tough procurement rules, cracking down on unfair dumping and unfair competition and putting in place tax incentives. We have had over a month with the new minister in place and has had the opportunity to respond on behalf of myself and the member for Cunningham to do the right thing. There is an important meeting in Sydney on Monday. We are expecting the government to do the right thing and that includes the New South Wales government and the federal government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  I rise today to provide an update to the people of Kariong about the progress of our commitments to them. Construction is underway on the long-awaited 'missing link', the M1-M2, or NorthConnex, which could save 15 minutes in valuable travel time for commuters between the Central Coast and the Sydney CBD. We have provided $675,000 in the federal budget towards making the Woy Woy Road and Langford Drive intersection safer, a project that now rests with Gosford City Council to finalise and build. I would urge council to deliver on this commitment and fix this road as a matter of priority. Three thousand local residents signed a petition calling on this dangerous intersection to be fixed and I share their concerns about the delay in getting this done. After all, the money has been in the federal budget for the last two occasions. So I have to ask: what are we waiting for?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also rolling out the NBN to Kariong, with construction to start in the first half of 2016. This is great news for the people of Kariong as services are usually available around 12 months from when construction begins. Kariong is also benefiting from our Safer Streets program, with $180,000 to install CCTV at the Kariong recreation area, Arunta Avenue shops and at the corner of Mitchell and Langford Drives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I advise that I am hosting a community BBQ at Kariong and I am looking forward to chatting to Kariong local residents over lunch and a drink. I just hope my listening skills are much better than my cooking skills!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  The PM pledged before the last election that he would speed up delivery of the NBN, but he has in fact delayed the rollout as he has struggled to get his second-rate copper wire plan out of the box. He also promised that those with the worst internet would be his top priority, but that is not happening. Many suburbs in the Perth electorate are in the two lowest bands for broadband speeds. Other than new developments, not one house and not one business will be connected to the NBN in this term of government. Some of the worst affected suburbs include Bedford and Embleton, and they have no chance before 2019. The residents are angry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Last Friday, I had the privilege of opening the Veterans Centre Sydney Northern Beaches at Dee Why RSL Club. The event was well attended, with triservice representatives, veterans and many community leaders. The Veterans Centre is the result of the vision and years of hard work by chairman, Commodore Graham Sloper AM RAN, Retired, and his team, together with centre manager veteran, Ben Webb. Its first home in 2012 was RSL Lifecare, but a generous partnership with Dee Why RSL Club has meant a modern suite of rooms has been provided in the club to enable an independent, holistic, regional service to veterans using the hub-and-spoke model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the period since the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, the need for greater support for veterans and their families is more acute than ever. The tragic loss of so many to suicide—253 since 1986; 25 this year—highlights the need for such a centre. Often when medically discharged, many veterans feel a great sense of loss being separated from the ADF, which had provided for them in so many ways. Ben Webb's own story—struggling first with physical injury, then with depression and PTSD, which he has overcome to be centre manager—is a great example and inspiration for others facing similar problems on their journey to recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centre offers both casework and advocacy services, as well as social and recreational activities, including: veterans and partner meetings, lawn bowls, yoga, bush walking, BBQs and other social activities. It is the hope that this model will be followed in rural and regional areas to give veterans the help they need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When he worked out that he could not destroy the NBN he got the coalition to give it a big group hug. He promised that he would deliver it by 2016 and it would be faster, cheaper and would have a speed of 25 megabits. With the NBN, everything Malcolm promised turned out to be the wrong way. The speed should have gone up but it went down. Costs should have gone down but they went up. The rollout should have gone faster but it went slower. The suburbs with the worst broadband connections had to wait the longest, while the best suburbs were getting the NBN.</span>

The PM is getting some of his own frenemy treatment handed back to him—and I am not talking about Andrew Bolt, who wrote, 'Malcolm Turnbull [is] … delivering less than he promised for twice the price.' I do remember, as will everyone in this place, who was up there saying that this project—a project that had been demonised—was a great project, kicked off by Labor? It was none other than the member for North Sydney, who said it was the right thing to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Unlike the opposition we are not here to play politics but to talk about issues that matter to people. I want to bring to the attention of the Australian Parliament the issue of continuous glucose monitoring. There are type 1 diabetic children in my electorate whose families have to pay subsidies to the tune of $5,000 a year, if they can afford it, because the Australian government is not paying for continuous glucose monitoring. If these children, particularly those who are under 18, can have access to this technology it helps them to monitor their blood glucose levels so that they can then monitor their insulin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently the program costs $900 for the monitor and $75 every five days for the pads that have to go on the children. The federal government should use its buying power to try to bring down the cost of this technology, and we should have a look at how we can subsidise it. If we invest in this technology it will help children to manage their blood glucose levels better and it will translate to their having fewer presentations at hospitals with the complications of diabetes. This will cost us only about $25 million a year. This is money well spent. These are the things that the federal government is concentrating on and talking about, because the health of our children is something we really care about and it is something we should be doing something about. The $25 million would be well-spent.</span>

In an unprecedented attempted invasion of privacy the commission served a 'notice to produce', signed by the royal commissioner, on the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, demanding access to all membership application forms and payment methods for the 2013 renewals of membership. This would disclose the name, home address, telephone numbers, email addresses, date of birth, gender, whether the member is Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, whether the member wishes to join Rainbow Labor, which could out people who are not yet open about being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex, their political history, their union affiliation and their income.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a low use of high office. It is a disgraceful, shocking abuse of power. We already knew that the Liberals' $80 million royal commission was a political witch-hunt designed to smear and slander the Labor Party and the labour movement, but this latest indecency goes beyond an assault on the unions. It is an attack on the fundamental democratic principle of freedom of association. This taxpayer funded inquisition is now attempting to break one of the foundation stones of Australian democracy. Australians will not stand for this, and the Liberals should be ashamed of knowingly, gleefully, aiding and abetting this travesty. The Prime Minister should bring it to an end immediately.</span>

What if I put a proposition to you that enhances apprenticeships, that is carbon neutral, that is world's best practice environmental activity? What if I put a proposition to you that enhances job opportunities in regional Australia? What if I put a proposition to you that makes every Australian feel good about what they do and when they do it? What proposition can I put to you that gives the opportunity for communities to grow and the opportunity for jobs and education in regional areas? What proposition can I put to you that joins us all together as one in support of my support for the CFMEU in my area? What proposition is there that joins us all together? I will tell you what it is. Do you want to give me an hand and tell me what that proposition is? The proposition is this: the one thing that can join us all together in regional Victoria in my seat of McMillan, in the Gippsland area, is to lean over your desk, in every workplace in Australia, and open up a ream of Australian-made paper. That is how good we are. It is a great opportunity—take it!</span>

Under the notice to produce, the details that this commission has sought are the names, the addresses, the mobile, work and home phone numbers, the email addresses and whether or not they are members of a trade union. They were asked to provide that information to the royal commission for 9,000 Victorians, many of whom may be public servants, who may not wish these matters to be disclosed, members of the Australian Defence Force, or police or nurses, and they do not want these matters to be disclosed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:00</span>):  The opposition leader seems determined to run a scare campaign on stand-alone measures. On this side of the House, we are focused on implementing an entire package of reforms that will ensure the way we are delivering support for families is sustainable and better targeted. The revised package introduced by the Minister for Social Services must be considered in the context of a range of Australian government family payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grandparent carers, for example, are eligible for a number of Australian government family payments, such as family tax benefit, parenting payment and childcare benefit, if they meet the eligibility requirements. For those grandparents on an income support payment, grandparent childcare benefit helps with the cost of raising children. Under this benefit, grandparents currently receive up to 100 hours a fortnight of free child care. In addition, if the child meets the criteria of an orphan, the grandparent carer may be eligible for a double orphan pension. Grandparent carers could also obtain a non-income-tested foster child healthcare card for the children in their care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that single parent families and families where a grandparent is the carer have particular challenges when it comes to child care. That is why we will continue to provide a supplemental payment of $1,000 a year to those families while a child is aged between 13 and 16. In addition, all eligible families with a youngest child under one will receive an extra $1,000 a year. So the government is committed to supporting parents in raising their children. We are also committed to ensuring the family and childcare systems remain targeted, sustainable and effective in the long term by reforming family tax benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The package will help pay for the $3.5 billion Jobs for Families package. If Labor are supporting the Jobs for Families package, which the member for Jagajaga on one occasion said must be paid for somehow, I would invite them to announce how they plan to pay for it if they do not agree with the plan that has been laid out by the Minister the Social Services.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:03</span>):  I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that there are many innovative industries, many dynamic entrepreneurial businesses, in her electorate that are looking forward to the enhanced opportunities to trade with China. Today, the legislation enabling the implementation of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement has passed this House. It is important for Australians, and Australian businesses in particular, to have confidence that the parliament works—and it was working today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all understand that the Chinese economy is in transition from a resource intensive, investment led growth to one that is premised on greater consumption, particularly of services. Just this week, we saw Chinese growth moderating to 6.9 per cent in the third quarter, still a very high figure, off a very big base. But we also saw growth in disposable incomes of 9.2 per cent and retail sales growing by 10.9 per cent from the 2014 quarter. And online retail business in China has surged 35 per cent year on year to the point where online retail is bigger in China than it is in the United States, and that is a gigantic opportunity for Australian businesses, at every level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elsewhere, the government is ensuring that it is doing everything to deliver a more innovative economy, to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the free trade agreement. We know on this side of the House that this is the most exciting time to be an Australian. We know that the opportunities available to Australian businesses are now, thanks to the hard work of the trade and investment minister, opening up these new markets. The only limits on our ability to seize those opportunities are our enterprise and imagination—and Australians have plenty of that, and they have plenty of courage. The fearfulness and anxiety that the opposition peddles every day is not being listened to by a confident nation or by confident businesses that want to get in and have a go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been consulting extensively—for example, on equity crowdfunding. We will be introducing equity crowdfunding legislation by the end of the year. That will enable new businesses to raise money using the power of the internet in a much more affordable fashion, a vital reform. Honourable members are familiar with the way in which we reversed the Labor government's catastrophic changes to employee share schemes, which did so much damage to the start-up sector, an extraordinary blunder which was even acknowledged as such by the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, may I say that, last night, at the Prime Minister's science prizes I was so pleased to award prizes to two great science teachers—because it is those teachers, right with Australians in their youngest years, who are building the foundations for our future prosperity. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Is the minister seriously suggesting that a grandparent carer should go back to work and put a 15-year-old child in child care?</span>

I must say that during that interview I had mistaken the question for one about FTB part A. But honestly, if after the number of interviews there were yesterday the most important thing on your mind is mistaking a question about FTBB for one about FTTA—fair enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the issue raised, about grandparent carers, is a live and fair issue. There are two issues with grandparent carers under the FTB system, both A and B. The first issue is one that is very difficult to tackle and that needs to be given further policy attention, and that is that when an FTB grandparent carer is not the legal carer or guardian of the child then the money that is paid under FTBA and FTBB flows to the legal parent and may never reach the hands of the grandparent who is actually caring for the child. That is a very large problem that we have to work through, as a government and as a parliament, and fixing that problem is not easy. The secondary problem is the one you have mentioned, and unequivocally what we are doing here is trying to increase workforce participation—</span>

Those that are now looking at having a reduction because of the fact that their child is turning 13 represent a very small number of the 1.3 million. But we are saying that there have to be proper incentives in that system for those parents to re-enter the workplace once their child turns 13. We would acknowledge that grandparent carers are probably the cohort for which ability to re-enter the workplace is more limited compared with other cohorts—not without—</span>

I also commend the House, including those opposite, who are supporting the passage today of the implementing legislation for this huge job-creating agreement. Australia has a rolled gold reputation throughout Asia for premium clean, green and safe produce and food that not only extends to fresh fruit and vegetables and agricultural products but, importantly, also extends to processed foods. The food processing sector makes up one third of Australia's manufacturing sector—a fact that is misunderstood. ChAFTA will open doors for Australian exporters large and small in processed food. For example, tariffs of up to 30 per cent on our processed food exports will be eliminated—everything from honey, fruit juices, pasta and canned fruit and vegetables through to wine, chocolate, biscuits and cakes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to cite one excellent example from the small country town of Coleraine, in the member's electorate. Coleraine is four hours from Melbourne, it has sand greens on the golf course, and you do not want to blink if you are driving through. It is also down the road from where my wife, Maureen, grew up. In Coleraine you will find Fiona Wall Fine Foods—biscuit maker extraordinaire. From humble but ambitious beginnings, Fiona's business began exporting two years ago. Fiona is already exporting Anzac biscuits and choc-chip cookies to China—a pallet load every month—despite paying tariffs of 15 to 20 per cent per box of biscuits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As result of our FTA, these will be eliminated and, as a consequence, as Fiona has said: 'The phones haven't stopped ringing. It's really exciting.' She is confident that one pallet load a month will become a shipping container a fortnight. She said, 'I'm looking at signing a deal for access to another hundred stores in Shanghai because of confidence in our product and the free trade agreement.' She also plans to expand her business into other fine foods, including dried fruit, nuts, muesli and wine. Fiona employs 12 people in a town of 1,400 but is looking to double that number off the back of the free trade agreement. She predicts that next year is going to be a stellar one for her business.</span>

Yesterday, when the minister was queried about his cuts to family tax benefits that will hurt grandparent carers, the minister answered, 'The point being made here by Labor is a fair point.' The minister then confirmed grandparent carers will be $2½ thousand a year worse off. Does that mean the minister designed these cuts to family tax benefits in full knowledge that they would leave grandparent carers around $2½ thousand a year worse off?</span>

What history has shown is that very often one of those decisions is to either engage or engage more in the workplace. The old-fashioned and ridiculous assumption that members opposite have is that if you are a single-parent carer or a grandparent carer then your engagement with the workforce has somehow ended, that it is over, that your life is over and all that is left for you is caring.

                  </a>  Of the 1.3 million FTBB families, 3,700 of those are registered as grandparent carers. They are the people who are formally legally guardians of children. As I noted in the question previously, there is a whole other cohort who are actually looking after children and do not benefit at all from FTBB, because we find it as a government and you found it as a government very difficult to identify their status as a carer. It is very often natural parents who have little to do with the children that are receiving the funds. That is a real problem. The problem of 3,700 people having a greater incentive and having a government trying to enable them to enter the workforce is a much smaller problem. But, if it is a problem that you wish to discuss with me, that kumbaya hand of friendship is open.</span>

That is what we do: get a better return through the farm gate so that businesses that are present in his electorate such as Frewstal Pty Ltd, a lamb processor employing 400 people, will get better access through reduced tariffs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the 15,000 small businesses that are in Mallee are associated with the agricultural sector. They have the capacity to employ more people. There is one business alone that this year has exported 200 containers of citrus to China, and they expect to be exporting more next year because of the free trade agreement that this country and our government have put together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or it might be the fact that 75 per cent of the nation's table grapes are grown in the Mildura area. These grapes are going into the Chinese market and getting a better return. It is a labour-intensive industry that is employing more people, earning money for our nation and bringing more money back to the farm gate for our farmers. Select Harvests, the largest almond producer in Australia, is vertically integrated. It is producing nuts and muesli. They will get greater access into China. Almonds are our largest horticultural product, earning $522 million a year. That is looking like it will grow to about $600 million next year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is real growth happening under this government. This is real delivery happening under this government. It is happening right now. It is being facilitated by the hard work that this nation and this government have put towards negotiating these agreements and getting them through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The growth is not just in almonds. It is, as we explained yesterday, also live cattle who start their journey down in Melbourne. Those southern cattle producers can also get access to another market in the live cattle trade. It is also in areas in other seats, such as that of the member for Petrie. Fishermen in the member for Petrie's seat are fishing for spanner crabs. Spanner crabs will also get a reduction in tariffs. Those fishermen are looking forward to an expansion of their prospects by reason of these free trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have always said, whether you are living by the sea or on land, it does not matter. This nation has delivered via this government a vision of a great outcome, a greater return to the farm gate and a greater return on the trawler. We have a plan. You are seeing that plan. We are most definitely delivering on the plan so that we can get more income for our nation, a better style of life, a better future and, all in all, a better return.</span>

The family tax benefit system has been growing very substantially. The government of the members opposite made $7 billion worth of savings by pausing indexation on FTB part A and FTB part B. They made $6 billion worth of savings by removing the indexation of FTB rates to pensions. They made $2.5 billion worth of savings by not proceeding with the additional increase to FTB part A payments. So let's not pretend that members opposite have not also looked to make expenditure restraint savings from the FTB system. That was $7 billion plus $6 billion plus $2.5 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, like members opposite, have recognised the need to make savings inside the system. We have recognised that need. There are two ways in which we are making savings inside the system. You may want to describe the first way as a snake, as I did, because I think it is a fair description. There are savings. We are phasing down and removing an antiquated supplement system through FTB savings. That supplement system was designed to pay debts which are now no longer the problem they used to be. We are phasing that down and removing it and we will put the savings back into FTB A so that families will receive $10 more a fortnight. That is a ladder. When families receive more money—</span>

He is somebody who is a tremendous local advocate for clean air and clean water and also a real advocate and fighter for jobs in his electorate and across New South Wales more generally. Both of these things come together in the China free trade agreement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As members know, China has enormous air quality and water quality challenges. The great task of bringing hundreds of millions of people out of poverty comes with it challenges and pressures to do with air quality, water quality, land quality and pollutants. These are real issues that affect hundreds of millions of lives. That is why the Chinese energy efficiency, water quality and air quality market is, on the best advice that we have, worth up to a trillion dollars a year.</span>

                  </a>  It is the most huge and unprecedented market for air, land and water environmental services in the history of the world. Against that background, Australia is well positioned. We know that we export about $1.6 billion worth of environmental goods and services a year. In New South Wales we have firms such as Envirolab, one of the Asia-Pacific's leading testing firms with regard to air quality, water quality and acid sulphates. They have the opportunity to move into this Chinese market. At the moment we only penetrate it to the extent of about $113 million a year. But in what is potentially a trillion dollar market, the bills passed today to enable the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, as pioneered by the extraordinary trade minister, give us the opportunity to dramatically expand jobs in New South Wales and, indeed, in each state and territory of the country. We can become one of the world's great exporters of environmental services, environmental equipment and environmental testing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the free trade agreement bring? It brings us preferred access in terms of our manufactured goods by removing the tariffs on Australia's environmental goods. It brings us preferred access in terms of our environmental services by opening up opportunities for Australian firms such as engineering firms in Tasmania and Solahart in New South Wales. We have other firms right across the country that can participate in this market. In so doing, they do two things. They provide jobs for Australians, they provide opportunities and they provide us with the ability to be a world leader and innovator. Even more importantly, perhaps, they offer an improvement in quality of life, air quality and water quality for hundreds of millions of people in China. Today is a red-letter day for Australia— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  has no benefits under the proposals that we are bringing in. So let me talk you through where there are very significant benefits. Had that single parent written that letter during the time of the Labor government, when they took out $7 billion, $6 billion and $2.5 billion, when they were all stick and no carrot, when they were all snake and no ladder, they would have been correct that there would have been no upside for that parent. But under the proposals that we are bringing there are a range of benefits which can very much engender workforce participation and make that parent better off. Let me explain what they are.</span>

                  </a>  That parent who already works will find her child care $30 a week better because she will receive $30 more each week under the childcare package that has been put together. That will be $1,500 a year. That is a very significant increase in the welfare for that person. Indeed, it is a situation where workforce participation for any parent, but that parent particularly, can grow, where they will be enabled and encouraged to increase their participation. Whilst we are phasing down and ending supplements, we will be reinvesting $10 a fortnight back into family tax benefit A. The question is designed to pretend that a parent in that situation does not avail themselves of two streams of family tax benefit: B, paid for the family, which we are ending when the child is 13; and A, where we are reinvesting much of the money, making it $10 better off a fortnight. That adds up in a year. The individual parent can also choose, by virtue of the childcare package, to engage in the workforce or to work more. You are assuming that every person in that situation is perfectly passive and leaves their situation exactly as it is—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:37</span>):  I thank the member for Reid for his question. He knows more about small business and more about business than certainly anyone on that side of the House, and those on this side of the House who have that experience will know that he has been a great success when it comes to his experience in business. What he knows and what we all know is, in a strong and competitive economy, the consumer must be at the top of the tree. The economy must be directed towards the consumers, for them to have the most choices possible, and they need to be in the driver's seat of our economy. The economy must be able to respond to those demands, and they need to have as many choices as possible. That is what is necessary to ensure we can have strong growth in our economy and we can have jobs growth in our economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the government acted. The Turnbull government acted to increase choice and to empower consumers in our economy through our response to the Murray review. We are giving Australians greater control of their own savings for their retirement through superannuation: through greater choice of funds—not having those choices directed by unions and others—through greater choice of products, and particularly encouraging them to take on the annuity-style products which will ensure that they will have an income stream in their retirement years, and through ensuring that there is even better advice available to people about these decisions and there is stronger governance of superannuation funds, which continues to be opposed by those opposite. You have got to ask yourself the question: why would they oppose having better governance of people's superannuation? They must think it is their money. We know it belongs to those who have saved for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we will legislate to ban profiteering card surcharges and we will introduce a fair dinkum test so you can only charge what you have been charged yourself, as a merchant. This has been warmly welcomed. Choice have said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We have long campaigned for a better banking system in Australia and the Federal Government's decision today to crush sky-high credit card surcharging delivers on a big priority for consumers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Turnbull government has done. We will act to ban, through legislation, these profiteering surcharges. Today I met with the head of the ACCC to get that process underway. We will do this as quickly as possible. We will work with businesses who will be affected by this decision, to ensure that there is a very fair process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of our broader plan to grow jobs and to grow the economy—whether it is a consumer focused competition policy or ensuring tax system changes that encourage people to work and to save and to invest, or the innovation statement which will be delivered later this year, or the $50 billion worth of infrastructure spending, or strengthening the budget. All of this, together with the free trade agreements which have been completed by the Brownlow medallist of ministers in the parliament, the Minister for Trade and Investment—this is how we are growing the economy and growing jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What we are saying on this side of the House with respect to grandparent carers, single-parent families and couple-parent families is that we must devise the architecture of the system so that taxpayer funds are being applied in a way which creates the greatest enablement and incentive for workplace participation. That 3,700-person cohort we are talking about are not all of age pension age. A very large number of them are—</span>

                  </a>  You know—surprise, surprise—on this side of the House we say that at 50 or under 50 there is a great importance in maintaining engagement with the workplace. That is good for you; it is good for your family; it is good for the nation. So we simply do not accept whatever assumptions you do and you work under. What we are doing is devising a system that provides, by having an alignment between the way in which we fund child care and the way in which we transfer taxpayer funds to family tax benefit recipients, the greatest possible incentive to work. I would put this question: when we saw, as we did under members opposite, that you took $7 billion out of the FTB system by indexing income thresholds, which you did in 2008-09, which you expanded in 2009-10, which you continued in 2011-12, which you continued in 2013-14; when you removed the indexation of FTB rates from pension indexation, which you did in 2009-10, which took $6 billion out of the system; when you failed to proceed with additional increases to FTB part A payments, which took $2.5 billion out of the system, which affected grandparent carers and affected every single family on FTB, but there was nothing ancillary or in relation to that that helped any of these people—nothing in child care, nothing for children under one— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This government understands that Australia's prosperity and economic growth depends upon seizing new opportunities. We understand that the government must be flexible and responsive to opportunities that promote investment into Australia and that we must be internationally competitive.</span>

I want to thank the executives from Disney and Marvel who flew from Los Angeles to Canberra for the announcement. Secondly, Twentieth Century Fox will bring Sir Ridley Scott to Australia in 2016 to direct his next <span style="font-style:italic;">Alien</span> film. These two films are expected to inject over $300 million of offshore investment into Australia, deliver many thousands of jobs for Australians and use the services of more than 6,000 Australian businesses. Film tourism, as my colleague the Minister for Trade and Investment well knows, is an increasing drawcard for overseas visitors, so the spin-off for tourism will be significant too. We do have the evidence for these expectations.</span>

For this production Australian companies created new, innovative technologies that are now being used around the world, enhancing our international reputation for innovation. A Melbourne based company, XM2 Aerial, designed drones to carry heavy cameras in the production of this film and they are now being used around the world. Botany Cranes in Sydney developed and manufactured specialised camera platforms; they are now being used around the world. On-Crete, a Gold Coast company, developed a cement render which revolutionised set building; that is now being used worldwide.</span>

I will not say 'surprisingly', but it was a first science event that I have been at with the huge number of people where there was a standing ovation for the Prime Minister after his speech. I think it speaks volumes about the support for our innovation agenda in the science community and the opportunity to grow the new economy in Australia to match agriculture and mining as one of the staples of our economy in jobs and growth.</span>

The PM's prize for science, worth $250,000, was won by Professor Graham Farquhar from the ANU, who lives in the member for Eden-Monaro's electorate. He has successfully modelled photosynthesis to create new water efficient wheat varieties.</span>

He works from the University of Newcastle. He has created something called the Jameson cell, technologies that use trillions of bubbles to capture and use coal dust that would otherwise be wasted. It is estimated that he has saved the Australian economy $36 billion because of the Jameson cell over the last few years. It has actually—</span>

As the honourable member knows, the government's policy is that the question of whether same-sex marriage will be legalised in Australia will be determined by a vote of all Australians by plebiscite, in fact, after the next election. The mechanics for that plebiscite will be the subject of careful consideration by cabinet and then, of course, consideration by the party room. We will deal with this in the traditional manner of a traditional cabinet government. I thank the honourable member for her interest and when the government has more to say on the mechanics, we will do so.</span>

We will give every single Australian a vote. You will not; that is the difference. Under our approach, every Australian will have a vote. I know the member for Sydney said yesterday that it was not democratic to give every Australian a vote. Let me tell you, it is perfectly democratic; it gives everyone their say. What sort of latter-day Leninism approach to democracy is it when the people do not get a say?</span>

As the member is no doubt well aware, there are 8,280 children from 5,950 families who attend 100 approved childcare centres in his electorate. They are the people who will be subject to all of the benefits that we can offer them if we can find a way to pay for improved child care and improved weekly payments for child care—a simpler system. The reforms in FTB that are before the House will pay for that improvement in child care for the people in the member's electorate. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the member may also know is that, when the Productivity Commission inquired into this very issue, they found 165,000 respondents in Australia who explicitly stated that they wanted to work more but that there were disincentives to do so. They are the 165,000 Australians for whom members opposite have no plan. They are Australia's forgotten people. They are the people who want to re-engage in the workforce, who want to work more and who want the benefits of the childcare package that we wish to move through this parliament, but members opposite wish to stop the mechanism for paying for those benefits. The very, very old-fashioned view held by members opposite does not accord with the way in which modern Australian families improve their circumstances. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at 2011, there are some excellent datasets kept by the ABS on maternal workforce participation. In 2011, about 54 per cent of mothers were engaged in the workforce. In 1994—not that long ago—that was only 40 per cent. There has been a 14 per cent increase in maternal workforce participation. These are the people that the coalition seeks to assist by finding a way to pay for reformed and better child care. These are the people that members opposite have absolutely no plan to assist. With the reforms to FTB that are before the House, families with children under one year will get an extra $1,000 from 2016-17—that is, 1.3 million families from 2016-17 who will benefit from that extra $1,000. About three-quarters of the 1.6 million FTB-A families plus 22,000 disability support pension and youth allowance recipients will be $10 better off a fortnight—all of them better off a fortnight. Families with incomes between $65,000 and $170,000 will be $30 better off a week in terms of their access to child care. Supplements will be phased out, and that is the way that we will pay for these very, very important reforms. </span>

He thinks so little of the people of this country that he does not believe we are capable of having a civil debate on a matter of this importance. He is so frightened of public debate that he wants to shut the people out. I thought that he would be saying, 'Don't have a plebiscite; it costs a lot of money.' That is a good point; it does cost a lot of money. But, no, his opposition to a plebiscite is because he does not want people to be able to express their views. He is worried that, in a free debate, there may be some views expressed which he finds unpalatable. Let me tell you, I have great faith in the decency, in the common sense, in the humanity and in the wisdom of the Australian people, and, if there are unruly voices heard, they will be drowned out by the common sense, the respect and the general humanity of our people. We are capable of great things in this country. </span>

It was a pleasure to be with her in her electorate for the opening of the Karratha Airport upgrade recently—a terrific infrastructure project undertaken by the local community to improve their connection with the rest of the country. That is one of many substantial infrastructure projects being undertaken in Western Australia at the present time. The Commonwealth is contributing substantially to that under our $50 billion infrastructure program. Indeed, we will be spending around $800 million in Western Australia this year alone, and we have about  $5½ billion commitment to Western Australia for infrastructure programs under the current agreements.</span>

In the member's own electorate, the 75-kilometre upgrade of the Great Northern Highway between Muchea and Wubin is currently underway, and that will make a really big difference to the people travelling those vast distances in Western Australia. We have another $385 million project for upgrading work in that area. There is $218 million for the North-West Coast Highway, and those sorts of projects will make a real difference.</span>

But there is a double problem with this particular claim, because these were projects that Labor intended to fund from the proceeds of the mining tax. Indeed, we have the word of the former Treasurer—when asked about what would happen if the mining tax could not raise enough money for these infrastructure projects, he said, 'Well, if we don't have the revenue from the tax, then we can't make the investment.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  A few weeks ago, the member for Wentworth casually sauntered out into one of the courtyards here in Parliament House and he announced to the Australian people that he would be cutting down a first-term Prime Minister. What was the reason he gave to the Australian people for this move? He told us that Australia was not receiving the economic leadership we needed, and, hence, he needed to replace the Prime Minister. It was quite extraordinary: the putative Prime Minister was saying that the cabinet of the government he had been a senior minister in for two years was letting Australia down when it came to the economy. The Labor Party has been pointing this out for two years; we have been making that argument. Malcolm Turnbull, the now Prime Minister, made the argument, and the majority of the Liberal Party agreed with him. They had come around to the point of view that they were not giving Australia the leadership it needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was the Prime Minister's answer to this question—his secret weapon on the economy? It turned out it was the member for Cook, his new Treasurer. This was his appointment to turn around the malaise in economic policymaking in Australia. Well, we finished today the first full sitting fortnight of the Turnbull government with the new Treasurer, and we have seen a performance over the fortnight that makes the old Treasurer look good. Who would've thought the member for Cook could make the member for North Sydney look on top of his brief! Who would've thought that he could make the member for North Sydney look like a paragon of competence in his first outing as Treasurer in the House! But he managed to do it. So it has been quite clear through this fortnight that, if the member for Cook is the answer, the Prime Minister has asked the wrong questions about the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, let us look at the new Treasurer's performance when it comes to the budget. The whole raison d'etre of the Abbott-Turnbull government is to fix the budget. They told us they would get back to surplus, and that was the whole reason for their being elected. And one of the new Treasurer's first moves—right out of the blocks—as new Treasurer was to say: 'Australia does not have a revenue problem.' It was only a spending problem, he said. We have heard that before, because the member for North Sydney used to say that standing here and he used to say it standing on the other side as well, that Australia did not have a revenue problem. But then he came to office and he brought down a budget, and he brought in a GP tax, a petrol tax and a deficit levy—all revenue measures. Yesterday, the former Treasurer gave his valedictory speech and he begged for high-income superannuation concessions to be reined in. He even called for reform of negative gearing. They would be revenue measures. The former Treasurer had worked out what the new Treasurer is yet to work out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At question time we asked the new Treasurer: how much did revenue fall between the 2014 and the 2015 budgets? The answer could qualify as simply bizarre, because he came to the dispatch box to tell us about spending. That was his answer to a question about revenue. I will concede this: spending under this Treasurer is running at GFC levels—that is true. We concede that and we agree with that. But then the new Treasurer tells us that we should reduce spending to the same proportion it was in 2007 under the Howard government, which was 23.1 per cent of GDP. So from 25.9, which is high, to 23.1. That amounts to $45 billion a year in cuts that he says the nation needs to embrace. Let's consider just how big that would be. The age pension in the budget is $44 billion and he wants $45 billion worth of cuts. He could abolish the age pension. That would be one way to do it, and with this government you would not put it past them. They have already had a go at the pension, on several occasions. That just shows the magnitude of this Treasurer being completely out of his depth. No wonder he is confused about when they are going to get back to surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We asked him when Australia would get back to surplus. Quite clearly, he thought it was a trick question. He was not happy to answer that question, because he could not answer. We will forgive him that. You have some question times that are better than others. He was asked again on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Today </span><span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">how</span>, the next day, so he had 24 hours to think about this. In an interview which I think would be an equal tie with the Minister for Social Services for the biggest train wreck of the week, he told us that we will get back to surplus 'in the future when we get to that point'. That was his very detailed answer. It would not be in the past—he cleared that up; we will get to the surplus in the future. That is the new position of the Abbott-Turnbull government. We have had several. We were told there was going to be a surplus in the first year. That has been and gone, as has every year afterwards. Then we were told at the end of the forward estimates that it would be in four years. That is no longer the case. Then we were told it would be at the end of the decade. Then the former Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, said it did not really matter when we got back to surplus. Now the new Treasurer says, 'It does matter and we'll get there in the future at some point.' That is the fiscal strategy of the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer is all talk when it comes to economic growth. He told us, 'You should be focused on economic growth like we are.' If you were the Treasurer in the Abbott-Turnbull government, would you be talking about economic growth? I do not think you would be boasting about the performance. Again, we asked the Treasurer: was growth for this financial year revised up or down in the Abbott-Turnbull government's last budget? We did not get an answer to that. He could have tabled a document or he could have tabled a graph of growth under the Liberal government. He could have tabled this graph showing growth going down under this government. He chose not to do that.</span>

                  </a>  There is no adrenaline rush. We will get to confidence in a minute, the member for Fraser. He could have tabled that, but he did not. Is it any wonder that growth is down when confidence has been so down on this government's watch? Business and consumer confidence is down. Westpac's Consumer Sentiment shows consumer confidence remains down, even after the recent change of management, the coup, where the first-term Prime Minister was cut down by the member for Wentworth. It remains down by 12 per cent on the election. The index has been under 100 for 18 out of the last 20 readings, which means it is in negative territory. Confidence remains down because of the lack of confidence in the economic management of this government. The backbench showed lack of confidence in the economic management of the Abbott-Hockey government and the nation has lack of confidence in the economic management of the new Treasurer, and we are continuing to see that play out day after day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had two years of failed leadership—two wasted years under the Liberal-National Party government. We were promised an adrenaline charge to confidence and all we have had is two wasted years. There has been two years of arrogance, two years of false starts, two years of missed opportunities and two years of prejudice and cuts, exactly the opposite of what the Australian people were promised. The performance has been so bad over two years that the government cut down their Prime Minister, because they were told that economic management was not up to scratch. That was the campaign pitch of the member for Wentworth: economic management has not been up to scratch and he said he had a new plan to fix it, and that new plan was the member for Cook. The new plan is not working either. Plan B turns out to be as much of a shocker as plan A. What we see is that the member for Cook is clearly not up to the job. The arrogance is there, the insults are there and the lack of confidence is there, but we do not have an economic strategy to promote growth and opportunity. We do not have an understanding of the budgetary pressures on Australian families, and we saw that play out with the sterling performance by the Minister for Social Services today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I am meant to constrain my remarks to the Treasurer, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, but I am sure you will not mind if we point out for just a moment that this is a cabinet-wide problem. One of the most senior ministers in the government—the Minister for Social Services—is clearly not on top of his brief and is arrogantly lecturing to Australia's families and Australia's grandparents that they have to go back to work or they should put their 15-year-old in child care, bizarrely. No wonder the Treasurer thought he had a good day, because the Minister for Social Services finally got to his feet and finally the Treasurer looked like one of the more competent ministers in the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fairness, I do not hold the new Treasurer responsible for all the economic problems in this nation; the entire Liberal-National Party government of the last two years created these problems. The new Treasurer needs to be on top of his brief if he is going to get on top of the incompetence of the last two years. The new Treasurer needs to show that he has the empathy and the understanding of the issues. The new Treasurer needs to show that has an understanding of the full details of his portfolio if he is to turn around this mess, this two year mess of economic management, which sees growth down, confidence down, investment down, unemployment up, the deficit up and debt up. Can this Treasurer turn this around? Can this Treasurer fix the mess of the last two years? The evidence is in, and the answer is no.</span>

It was matched only by the enthusiasm of his own members sitting behind him for that monologue style of his—that very loud monologue, which I know the member for Hughes struggled to hear! So make it a bit louder next time and maybe the member for Hughes will pick up what you were saying. It is as if the shadow Treasurer has not received the memo about what is needed in the Australian economy, because he is talking in the same way that he has talked over the past two years, using the same old language the Australian people have indicated they do not want to hear any more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want to hear a government that is talking about promoting economic growth. The shadow Treasurer ridicules the concept of growth and why we need growth in the economy. But economic growth is at the core of this government's agenda. It is at the core of improving our way of life and improving our standard of living. It is a given fact, which the Prime Minister reiterates time and time again, that Australia cannot afford to stand still and that we must grow our economy, to provide the jobs and higher incomes and the greater prosperity and financial security that we all deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we sit through this kind of monologue from the shadow Treasurer—really just ranting at us for 10 minutes—it really is not very constructive in regard to how we are going to improve our economy and what we are going to do to improve our standard of living. This week we have been able to come to an agreement on free trade—finally, the Labor Party has been able to stare down their union friends and say that they want to support the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. They have said they are finally going to stand up in the face of the false advertising campaign the CFMEU is running around the country and say, 'We support free trade with China because it will produce jobs, growth and prosperity.' That did not cross the shadow Treasurer lips in his presentation about the economy. Why wouldn't he get up and raise the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the benefits we have worked together as a parliament to deliver to the Australian people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, one of the first free trade agreements China has signed in the world, will be one of the great enablers of Australian prosperity for the 21st century. It will set up all of our children and grandchildren and it will deliver more jobs and prosperity than any other single measure taken by a government in Australia's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, we did not hear one note of optimism cross the shadow Treasurer's lips in his presentation—not one hope, not one dream and not one ambition. There was just a simple memo from the past that he has not got the message from the Australian people that they expect better of this parliament and they expect a government that will deliver better in relation to the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, the Treasurer has been working very hard on a national platform for economic growth. That is what we are all about in the Turnbull government: working collaboratively with some of our most important partners, the states and territories, to deliver the growth and prosperity we need. What does this mean? There are a number of pillars the Treasurer talks about, and none of these crossed the shadow Treasurer's lips, either: having a tax system that is fit for purpose, and I think everyone in here understands what I mean when I say that; and, competition policy that encourages the states to undertake necessary and long-overdue microeconomic reforms that we all know we need. If the shadow Treasurer does not want to listen to me, he can listen to that great reforming Treasurer Paul Keating, who said in a famous answer given in this house:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I guarantee if you walk into any pet shop in Australia, the resident galah will be talking about microeconomic policy.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, perhaps the resident galahs in the opposition could listen to the great Paul Keating about microeconomic reform. It is certainly the intention of this government to work collaboratively with the states to ensure that, in collaboration with the states, microeconomic reform is at the centre of the Turnbull government's agenda. That means infrastructure, involving the private sector, assisting the government, and recognising that there are infrastructure shortfalls that cannot be funded by government alone. No government can commit the amount of capital required to deliver and meet the state and federal infrastructure challenges all over our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this government brought in the asset recycling scheme. The shadow Treasurer said that the former Treasurer was no good. The asset recycling scheme, which is being enabled by every single state and territory is of course providing the capital from the federal government, providing the microeconomic reform, and delivering capital from the public and private sectors to enable infrastructure funding. As the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said time and time again this week in response to every negative question the Labor Party has thrown at us, when you want to fund something you have an obligation, a responsibility and an onus to tell the Australian people how you will fund that commitment. It is not 'somehow' or 'anyhow'. It is not an obscure request for detail. It is a vital component for any promise or commitment from any government or any serious member of this place or serious senior politician.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the 'somehow' for Labor is always missing. So, when we talk about infrastructure in our national platform for economic growth, when we talk about funding the critical infrastructure shortfalls that our nation has, you have to be able to enable private sector capital, you have to be able to have public and private partnerships, and you have to enable asset recycling. That is what the Turnbull-Morrison government is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through our free trade platforms, we are also working very hard on exports and new markets. With the free trade agreements, whether it be with Korea, Japan or China, this is the government that has progressed and signed all of these deals. So, criticise it all you like. Speak with us about your ideas on the details. But it is the Abbott and Turnbull governments that have signed these agreements. It is the Turnbull government that every single day is speaking about the new opportunities in emerging markets in our region. It is the Turnbull government that is pursuing government of the 21st century that recognises the need to modernise our laws, our tax system and our federation so that we can take advantage of the free trade opportunities that exist in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we saw that at the forefront of the government's agenda is a stronger financial system. We already have one of the strongest financial systems in the world. It is the case that the Howard-Costello years produced a strong financial system through world-leading prudential regulation of our economy, from APRA, which enabled our banks to be in the best place in the world in the lead-up to the most serious economic challenge that faced us, namely, the global financial crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we saw a considered measured approach on the financial systems inquiry and the Murray inquiry response. We saw the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer outline in detail exactly how this government will ensure we have a very strong financial services system into the future. What is most pleasing about that is that, for once—and I recognise some of the shadow ministers opposite—we did not have the usual snarkiness that we saw from the shadow Treasurer in this debate today. We did not have the usual sniping and attacks. We had, again, a collaborative approach from the opposition and the government on this. They recognised that the government has made common-sense responses to common-sense recommendations about our superannuation system and our financial services system that will enable a strong financial services sector into the future. Never mind that they do not agree with us about very important matters like independent directors on super boards.</span>

                  </a>  I know you do not agree, but I note today that APRA is pushing to complete the journey on this to have a majority of independent members on superannuation boards. It is not the government's position, mind you; the government's position in legislation is to have just one-third of independent directors in place on superannuation boards—prudent management of superannuation funds. And yet the Labor Party opposes such a common-sense, middle-of-the-road approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to all of these points, a strong budget that maintains our AAA credit rating and responsibly allocates money to the key drivers of growth is vital to the national platform for economic growth that the Treasurer is implementing. Last of all, but not to be discounted—not to be dismissed, because it is a central focus of the Turnbull government and a central focus of the Treasurer in his approach to all of these economic matters and the national platform for economic growth—is innovation to stimulate an agile economy so we can meet the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities. What you will see in the national platform for economic growth is that innovative approach brought forward by government so that we have a government for the 21st century—the government that the Australian people want, that is agile, that is responsive and that is capable of taking up all of these opportunities in our region to ensure that we have jobs and growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a pleasure to rise today to talk about economic matters because it allows me to highlight the government's national platform for economic growth. It is the Treasurer's intention to make sure that this economic agenda is not derailed by negativity. It will not be derailed by the negativity of the shadow Treasurer. We must accept the good ideas when they come forward. Our aim is to put the ideas forward that will meet the challenges of the 21st century—to ensure that we have a tax system that is fit for purpose, to ensure that all Australians can work, save and invest, and to ensure that everything that we do as a government meets the needs of the 21st century and the modern changing economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  Ahead of an AFL game at the MCG, Michael Nuciforo and Robert Crocitti were driving around East Melbourne looking for a place to park. As they put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As we drove past parked car, after parked car, after empty space that required a parking permit … It then hit us. Wouldn't it be great if we could just knock on someone's door and ask to park at their place for a small fee? … The more we thought about it, the more it made sense … We don't need more parking spaces, we just need to utilise the parking spaces we already have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parkhound is one of the many sharing economy services that have emerged in Australia over recent years. Uber, Lyft and Sidecar are transforming transport for many Australians and offer the potential of dealing with traffic congestion. Victorian freeway speeds have dropped from 68 kilometres an hour to 45 kilometres an hour over the last decade as our roads have become increasingly choked. Airbnb offers the opportunity to better deal with the challenge of housing affordability. At the same time as we have house prices to incomes at record highs, we have 10 million spare rooms across Australia. Pawshake and PetCloud offer opportunities to have your pet looked after in a friendly home. Airtasker, Freelancer and Sidekicker offer opportunities to find someone who can help mow your lawn or, most popularly, put together some new IKEA furniture. GoGet and DriveMyCar offer chances to let people share cars rather than clogging up our cities with more vehicles. Vayable offer local tours. EatWith offer a home-cooked meal. Camplify, based in Newcastle, is a sharing economy service that recognises that the typical caravan and campervan owner only uses them three weeks a year. These services have, in many cases, been put together by Australian innovators and entrepreneurs—people like Chris Noone from DriveMyCar, Tristan Sender from GoGet and Justin Hales from Camplify.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcome the sharing economy, but we also believe the sharing economy should play by some basic rules. Today, along with Bill Shorten and Ed Husic, I announced Labor's sharing economy principles. Firstly, primary property is yours to share. When Australians use their own homes, cars or goods to deliver services, then rules and regulations specific to the sharing economy should apply. Secondly, the new services should support good wages and working conditions, because there is nothing that Labor believes in more than making sure that workers get a fair deal. Thirdly, we believe there should be fair tax for everyone and that sharing economy services should pay their fair share towards supporting the government services that all of us enjoy. Fourthly, there should be proper protections for public safety and we must ensure that there is an environment that supports insurance. Fifthly, access for all allows Australians with disabilities to benefit from sharing economy services such as UberASSIST, which provides opportunities for people with disabilities to access a disability accessible car. Finally, the new services should play by the rules, and those rules, once put in place, need to be firmly and appropriately enforced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor came forward with these principles off the back of a discussion paper I announced in the National Press Club in March which garnered more than 500 submissions. We have moved on the issue of the sharing economy because the federal government has not. Just as Labor have taken up the challenge of policymaking in cities and in innovation, so too we are doing it in the sharing economy. You see this with other Labor governments across Australia. In the ACT, the Barr government is engaging with the regulatory structures surrounding Uber and ensuring that taxi drivers see a 75 per cent cut in their license fees and that ride sharing is appropriately regulated. In Victoria, the Victorian government is working with Airbnb to allow new opportunities in a disaster relief situation. Where people want to open up their homes and offer a free room to someone affected by a national disaster, Airbnb can facilitate that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the CBR Innovation Network, which hosted us today—the founder, Sarah Pearson, the chair, Tony Henshaw, and the companies that we met today: Made For Me, HACT, The Creative Element, Dilkara and SolarBare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sharing economy offers great potential for Australian innovators. It also offers the chance to tackle big challenges such as congestion and housing affordability. We need to get the rules right, and that is why Labor is leading on the sharing economy. We believe the sharing economy can work for workers, for consumers and for taxpayers alike. If the government will not lead, Labor will.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance regarding the economic leadership of the Treasurer, and do so with great pleasure. I thank the member for Fraser for that contribution—but I am not quite sure what topic he was talking about there, because the MPI is in relation to the Treasurer. It was totally off topic. We on this side of the House are very committed to a stronger economy. We are committed to running a surplus and committed to providing more jobs. I know that is foreign to the members opposite, particularly to the member for McMahon and the member for Rankin, who were responsible, with the member for Lilley, for something like six record budget deficits, year in, year out.</span>

                  </a>  And why is that? I will come back to that. But we are committed to a surplus. One thing that unites the coalition and the Liberal and Nationals parties is that we want to return the budget to surplus after eight years of deficits, started by Labor, spending billions of dollars—billions of dollars squandered on all sorts of things. It is time to return to surplus, and on this side of the House we are very committed to doing so. We are also very committed to ensuring that there are more jobs in the Australian economy, and we will never stop. And you are right: there might be people who are unemployed, and that is not good enough, and we will continue to work on that. We had a five-year target and a 10-year target, and we are on our way to achieving that. And every member on this side of the House is committed to more jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next week I will be running a job seeker boot camp for the people of Petrie. I have invited along something like 25 employers and about 50 local people who are unemployed—not just young people but older Australians as well—who can come along and have the chance to mix with employers and find out what it is that employers are looking for when they are hiring. These are positive steps. I know the member for Corangamite regularly talks to young people in her electorate as well about what they can do to achieve their goals and contribute to this great nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committed, of course, to lower taxes and higher productivity—and not just within the Public Service and not just within government, but we are helping businesses achieve better productivity by reducing red tape. Since we came to office something like $2.l billion worth of red tape has been cut. Paying less tax is good for the economy and is a due reward for the hardworking men and women of Australia who must save, work hard and invest. And we want to reward them. But what is Labor doing? They are increasing taxes. They are saying no to everything.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Rankin says we have not come back to surplus. But what have they done? How has he voted on budget saving measures to help Australia return to surplus so that children and young adults like those up there in the gallery and in my electorate of Petrie are not paying, for decades to come, for the way of life of Australians today? They have done nothing. The member for Rankin and every member on that side of the House has done nothing. They have voted against every saving measure. In fact, they have voted against their own measures. I am sure the member for Rankin and other members over there have said, 'We're going to save this; we're going to vote for that.' I think they said it would be $3½ billion worth of savings before the last election, and they have not passed one of their own. The hypocrisy of this MPI and of the actions of those opposite in this House is unbelievable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at ChAFTA. Finally, today they said yes. For months they have been saying, 'No, no, no, no, no.' They remind me of that historic British comedy <span style="font-style:italic;">The Vicar of Dibley</span>. I do not know who here has seen <span style="font-style:italic;">The Vicar of Dibley. </span>Do you remember Mr Trott? He always says, 'No, no, no, no, no, no no—yes.' That is the Labor Party. That has been the Labor Party, for months, on ChAFTA: 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no—yes.' That is the member for Rankin and every member on that side of the House. They need to get their act together. And, finally, I would say that they need to make the savings.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Australian people and to the people of Petrie: we live in the greatest country in the world—Australia is a wonderful country—but do not let the Labor Party come back to office. We cannot afford these members opposite. They have learnt nothing in two years. When the next election rolls out they still will have learnt nothing. We need to return to surplus. Australia will continue to be the greatest country on earth with the coalition in charge.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  It is the end of another big sitting week in Canberra. Lots of things have happened this week, and I think one of the most important, if we are honest about it, is that we are finishing the week with one less member in this place than we started with: the member for North Sydney has moved on. And for all the disagreements we had with the member for North Sydney, for all the substantial policy problems we had with his budgets and his approach to the economy, I think as he takes that long and winding road back today—the three- or four-hour drive from Canberra to North Sydney, with all his stuff packed up in the back of the car—he will probably take some quiet satisfaction that his replacement is no better than he is. And when the social services minister goes back to his office today and closes the door and curls up into a ball and rocks back and forth and mutters to himself about what happened to him in question time today, he can also take comfort from the fact that he is no worse than the Treasurer. And when the major projects minister goes back and wonders how he got caught defending a hole that was dug and a photo taken before the hole was filled back in again as a major project, he will at least thank his lucky stars that he is not going as badly as the Treasurer of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer fails to understand, when we ask him in question time whether growth has been revised up or revised down—that is pretty important for a Treasurer to know—and when he is asked what his plans are for the surplus and when we might have one. He says, 'In the future'. We are going to have one in the future. Then he gets up, in an answer to a question from the member for McMahon, and accidentally confirms that the spending of those opposite is actually higher than the spending that we left them with, which blew out of the water—completely torpedoed—all the rubbish from the member for Petrie, all the rubbish from those opposite about spending in this economy. He got up and in a big whoops moment decided that he would confirm that they are bigger spenders than we were in government. But more serious than all the gaffes and all the gobbledygook from the Treasurer is his failure to provide economic leadership, and that is what this MPI is about—his failure to convert his campaign of undermining the member for North Sydney into a plan for the economy of this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From time to time, when ministers get up, it is possible to bluff, bluster and bumble your way through question time, but it is not possible to bluff, bluster and bumble your way to jobs, growth and opportunity in this economy. It has been two years now and a picture has emerged of their economic management. That picture ain't pretty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The numbers do not lie. As the member for McMahon ran through, we do have some sickening numbers in the economy at the moment: growth at 0.2 per cent in the June quarter; annual GDP growth of just two per cent, well below trend; since the government's first budget we have seen annual GDP growth trending downwards quarter after quarter; five consecutive quarters of declining living standards; unemployment up to 6.2 per cent; 800,000 Australians out of work; consumer sentiment down 12 per cent from what it was at the election; a budget deficit which has doubled in the last 12 months; and real wages growing at their slowest rate since the ABS began measuring wages growth in our economy. That is the economic record of those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country we need to rebuild our economy an create jobs that last. That is the main task of this parliament at this time in our nation's history. Our economy is at a key juncture. We are in a transition in this economy between one where we have relied for a long time on the high prices that people will pay for our commodities to one that will rely more heavily on innovation and human capital, the sorts of things that the member for Chifley has been on about for as long as I have know him. We do need to focus on those things. Our remarkable quarter-century of growth in this country is at serious risk. If we choose the wrong path, if we get it wrong, we will lose that legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our choice, as the Leader of the Opposition says, is to get smarter or get poorer. Getting smarter means investing in science and technology. It means teaching and training our people for the jobs of the future and growing our economy in a way that ensures that there is enough opportunity to go around. That is the task of this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead we have a Treasurer who is not up to the task, who does not have a plan to do those things that we need, a Treasurer who was sacked from the board of Tourism Australia unanimously. He got 200 grand more as a payout than he was entitled to and refused to pay it back. He is a guy who got refused an adviser's licence by ASIC. That is the Treasurer of this country. He has a seriously chequered record. No wonder there is no plan for the future of this country or this economy with this Treasurer in charge.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  I have not spoken in an MPI for a while and I note with interest that I haven't really missed much! It is quite ironic that the topic, as always when I come to these MPIs, is that the Treasurer does not have an economic plan—this on the day that we agree and pass ChAFTA in this house. This government has had a strong record over its first two years through ChAFTA today and through the Japanese and Korean free trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I admire the member for Fraser and the wonderful oration he gave in his policy announcement this morning. Yes, it is about the future, but it is also about today. It is also understanding the structural budget deficit challenges that we actually face. The thing about ChAFTA that is ironic is that it is also about learning that at times that the problems are big enough you need bipartisan support for some things that are in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have a structural budget deficit. I have said this and will say it till I am blue in the face. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>belled the cat. In the next 40 years we will grow in the age bracket of 65-plus at three times the rate that we will grow in the age bracket of 0-64. You had the Leader of the Opposition earlier in the week stand up and ask why we would have the audacity to increase the retirement age, though the opposition when in government had done exactly the same. It is because we are living longer and larger portions of our life are spent in retirement, not earning or paying tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you can do two things: you can bury your head in the sand and hope that the future is going to save you or you can confront the problem today. I disagree completely with the member for Rankin but I do congratulate him on his promotion. The Minister for Social Services today belled the cat again. He stood at the dispatch box and explained that we are prepared to take the tough decisions we need to but balance with common sense. He explained that at stage in the six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government the opposition when in government were confronted with the same hard decisions. At times like that, we, like the opposition have today with ChAFTA, worked wit them to make tough calls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know when the light is going to switch on with the opposition. There are people over there that I have a lot of time for and who are quite switched-on people. At some stage they are going to have to tell us what they are going to do differently and how they are going to pay for it. We are getting close—within 12 months—to the next election. It is fine in opposition to spend two years pooh-poohing everything that the government wants to do and opposing for the sake of opposing, but at some stage they have to offer solutions beyond five-minute orations from the member for Fraser.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have so far as it sits today a $62 billion black hole. They want to spend—though we cannot actually get them to answer whether they do or not—$80 billion more than us on health and education in the next 10 years. They will not answer that question; they just want to criticise the fact that we will not spend $80 billion more like they want to but then will not say whether they will or will not. The shadow foreign minister wants to spend $16 billion more than we are in our forward estimates in foreign aid over the next 10 years; but, so far, over the same 10-year period they have proposed two revenue measures. One is a multinational tax package which they will not release the PBO budgeting on that will raise $9 billion over the 10 years. The other is a superannuation tax which moves the goalposts on people who have invested in their retirement in good faith under the rules of the day. That is going to raise $14 billion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LAUNDY:</span>
                  </a>  Jim, the numbers do not add up. You have got $23 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. There is $62 billion in a black hole. You have got $80 billion that you will or will not—you may answer the question at some stage in the next 12 months—spend. And there is $16 billion. That 62 is over the forward estimates. It was 57 but jumped to 62 in the last week. Before estimates the rest are for 10. So when you take the black hole for the forward estimates and spin the number out, it comes to somewhere in the order of $150 billion to $200 billion that you will not tell us how you are going to pay for. This is the problem we have. The reality will bite at some stage, and the people of Australia will work it out and value a government that is prepared to take the tough decisions that we need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  We have been talking a lot about leadership and economic leadership. We have been looking at the leadership, in particular, of Malcolm Turnbull. We have looked this week at some of his track record on leadership. We reflected on the fact that on the biggest project he has had to deal with he said he would deliver it faster and cheaper—but he has not. He has basically breached his promises. It is not being rolled out faster. It is being delivered slower. It is being delivered at double the cost of what was predicted. And the download speed target of 25 megabits per second by 2016 was not met. He has failed on every measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened as a result of that failure on one of the biggest projects in the country? He got promoted! I have been wondering why Malcolm Turnbull keeps saying, 'It's a wonderful time to be alive.' It is because if you stuff up a project like that you can become Prime Minister. That is agile, right there! He said that he needed to be the Prime Minister to provide economic leadership. Here is the test. As has been outlined by my friend and colleague that member for Rankin, the stats are devastating. We have an unemployment level now of over 800,000 people out of work, higher than it was during the GFC. We have wages flat as a tack and hardly growing, about the flattest they have been since records have been collected. Growth is not high enough to cut into that joblessness figure and it is not expected to be any time soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the size of the deficit you will see that, despite those opposite saying that they would come in and bring it down, it has gone up. There have been, for example, five quarters of declining living standards. That is worse than it was during the GFC. Confidence is down as well. When you look at consumer sentiment measured by the Westpac confidence measure you will see that it is 12 per cent below where it was at the election. That is where things are at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about economic leadership. We have a climate where people know that their living standards are declining and that wages are not growing at a rate to help them meet the cost of living. Also they are worried about, for example, what will happen next if they lose their job. What is the economic leadership provided by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer? What is their answer to give people comfort and to make people feel that they will be all right? Their answer is to bring in a bigger GST and cut penalty rates. This is the leadership being shown by those opposite. When they have been asked this week how they will deal with all those problems and deliver confidence, all they have had to rely upon is the financial systems inquiry—as if that is going to deal with all the issues that are on the table. We agreed with the financial assistance inquiry and we are working with the government on that, but they cannot claim that that is going to make any headway on the other issues I have mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It cannot be said, for instance, that a reliance on trade agreements alone, as good as they are, is going to fix all that. The Prime Minister said that he would provide leadership and do things differently. This is the test: what is he going to change? In the budget, for instance, those opposite have cut $80 billion in health and schools funding. What is he going to do on that? He said he is going to do the same thing. Everything has stayed the same. Everything is supposed to have changed but it has stayed the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of people on that side who feel they have been betrayed because they thought there was going to be something different. They thought they were voting for change, but the only thing that has changed is that they now have a different Prime Minister. But everything else, every other measure, is all staying the same. There are still the attacks on family payments. There are still the attacks on education and healthcare spending. There is still a commitment to that when we need to find a way to grow the economy, boost confidence and ensure that growth is not just limited to one sector.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I thank the shadow Treasurer for this opportunity to discuss the very strong economic leadership the coalition has provided over the last two years. How appropriate it is that he should pick today, of all days, to bring this up. To pick a day when a free trade agreement with the world's most populous nation has passed through this place highlights just how out of touch the Labor Party is. The coalition has concluded three free trade agreements that the previous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government could not do in six years </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Free trade is just natural trade. It is the normal default state of affairs for trade. People have wants, needs and desires—some demanding, others supplying. This is how it should be before meddling governments get involved for selfless or selfish reasons. Strong leadership is providing sustainable spending programs that deliver real and efficient results for all Australians. Strong leadership is about growing the wealth of the nation. Strong leadership is knowing that a rising tide lifts all boats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia must rely less on higher taxes to fund ever-increasing public expenditure. We have an expenditure problem, not a revenue problem. We must reduce the burden of tax on individual taxpayers as well as business, especially small business. Paying less tax is good for the economy and is due reward for the hardworking men and women of Australia. Tax is a disease—every economy needs a little bit, but too much and the economy dies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must encourage Australians to work, save and invest. If they work, save and invest to grow new business, open new markets and develop new products, they will be able to hire more Australians and promote more trade, especially with the growing middle class of Asia. We cannot wait for it happen and we cannot just expect it to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our coalition government have reduced real growth in government expenditure from the 3.6 per cent it was under Labor to 1.5 per cent per annum over the 2015-16 forward estimates. That is strong leadership. We have implemented a total of 332 budget measures out of a total of 402. Again, that is leadership. We are taking on the big end of town with respect to our response to the Murray financial services review. Again, that is leadership. At every turn there are examples of strong economic leadership from this coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> outlined how Labor's debt negatively impacts economic growth, wastes significant resources on interest payments and leaves Australia exposed in the event of an economic downturn. This is precisely why savings measures are so important. Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, savings measures have improved the budget bottom line over the relevant forward estimates period by more than $85 billion, with $64.3 billion in reduced spending and $20 billion in revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing in real terms is pro-growth policies vis-a-vis the infrastructure funding commitments, with responsibility achieved through fiscal consolidation. Yet Labor continues to block about $13.6 billion in budget repair measures which we have put forward. This only demonstrates that Labor is not responsible, capable or credible when it comes to economic management. I do offer the opposition one suggestion. It is simply this: park the politics of envy and put forward some real solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a terrific day for the many businesses and families in my electorate of Tangney. Today I am particularly proud that our government has a plan and is getting on with the job of providing strong economic leadership.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance which talks about the failure of the Treasurer to provide economic leadership. If you want to see how the Australian economy is tracking, just look at some of the key indicators—indicators that some of my colleagues have referred to but which I will repeat just to create the picture. Unemployment is up from 5.8 per cent when we left office to where it is now at 6.2 per cent. The underutilisation rate is above 14 per cent. The annual GDP growth rate is tracking at around two per cent and trending downwards. The projected budget deficit was $17 billion when we left office. It went to $35 billion in just 12 months, and I understand that as at last month it was about $48 billion. Government spending is at 26 per cent of GDP and government revenue is at 23.5 per cent of GDP. A particularly interesting indicator is that in the last six months the Australian share market index has fallen from 5,900 to 5,300.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures paint a very clear picture, and the picture is that the Australian economy is struggling. The government excuse will always be that commodity prices have fallen, that the Chinese economy is stalling and that we need to make tough decisions. They are weak excuses which simply do not stand up to scrutiny. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Have a look at the US, the UK and New Zealand who, during the GFC, were tracking with much more difficulty than Australia. The US economy is growing at a rate of 2.7 per cent, the UK economy at 2.4 per cent and the New Zealand economy at 2.4 per cent at the moment. Regarding their unemployment rates, the US is 5.1 per cent, the UK is 5.4 per cent and New Zealand is 5.9 per cent. All are lower than Australia's rates. That is despite the Australian dollar falling from 92c when we were in office to 70c against the US dollar, despite the three free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China that members opposite keep talking about and despite the fact that the GFC is now behind us. It is not surprising that Westpac consumer sentiment shows that, since the election, consumer confidence in this country is down by 12 per cent. That reflects the message that I get every day while I am out there talking to people and businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is good reason for that consumer confidence to be down. Yesterday the member for North Sydney, in his valedictory in this place, applauded Labor's NBN policy because he understood the productivity gains and the industry efficiencies and how we can connect with the rest of the world much more easily. Indeed, the Prime Minister today referred to it in terms of the importance of online trade. He understood the importance of having a high-speed, fast broadband in this world. It is no longer a luxury; it is an essential piece of infrastructure. Yet what do the government do? They stall the rollout, they provide an inferior service and the country goes backwards and becomes a joke. Why? It is because the government simply do not understand the importance of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Which other advanced economy has trashed its manufacturing industry sector as this government has—and for no better than ideological reasons? None. Other countries value their manufacturing industry sector. Indeed, the USA and UK economies are both growing their manufacturing industries rather than trying to push them backwards and downwards. This government is putting ideology ahead of sound economic management. Which other smart economy would even contemplate spending $50 billion on buying submarines from overseas when Australia has the capability to build them here, when we have Australian ship workers who are losing their jobs and when it actually makes economic sense as well as military sense to build the subs here in Australia? No other government would ever even contemplate that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government simply does not get it and simply does not understand how to manage an economy. The Turnbull government, now with a new Treasurer, has clearly lost control of its budget. Its simplistic and desperate solution is to cut government spending with no understanding and no compassion for the consequences. It is pinning all its hopes on the China free trade agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to that, it is interesting to see that the ink has barely dried on the Japanese and Korean free trade agreements and they have been relegated to the waste bin in terms of the commentary we hear from members opposite in this place. They never talk about them anymore. It is all about how the Chinese free trade agreement is going to save this government. They might hope it will, but it is going to take more than that to do so. What the economy needs is policies that are based on common sense, policies that will show some leadership. When it comes to that, this government has clearly failed to provide the economic leadership that will provide confidence to the rest of the Australian community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  It is a great opportunity to talk on the MPI when our colleagues opposite put up something about economic management. It is like shooting ducks. Unfortunately, members opposite seem to have a bad case of economic amnesia. They criticise us any time a difficult decision is made in this House. That is the job Australia gave us. We went to the 2013 election promising to get our debt under control. And as soon as we start doing that they go weak at the knees. They are not prepared to do anything apart from spend more money. It is really easy to spend money, particularly when it is somebody else's. Margaret Thatcher had it right: the trouble with socialism is that they spend everyone else's money and then, when the money runs out, the whole system collapses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have just got to look at what the net debt was for Australia in 2007. It was a negative debt. We had $29 billion in the positive, having inherited $96 billion in the red when the Howard government came to power in 1996. The debt trajectory that we inherited when we came into responsibility for the Treasury was trending at reaching $666 billion by 2023. That is 26½ per cent of the GDP in federal government debt. This is often compared to government debt in other countries, but a lot of those other countries do not have a similar system to ours. They might have a unicameral system and not necessarily have states. If you add Australian federal government debt to state and local government debt, we are up there at $710 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the winds are heading in the wrong direction in the world economy, you really have to have a government that has got its books in order. That is why it is so important. When the GFC came along, what kept us in place? We had a sound banking system and we had next to no debt. Admittedly, guaranteeing the stability of the banks was a good call. I supported that. But spending billions and billions of dollars—which is a permanent debt that we and all Australian taxpayers have to pay back—to get dodgy school halls and pink batts and to have nothing else to show for it was just a crime. No-one would mind if the Labor government had built the freeway from Sydney up to Brisbane, or the Bruce Highway, or even the inland rail. But no—pink batts and dodgy school halls; that is what you got for your money. It was just a waste of money. So, when they try and have a go at us for economic mismanagement, I just laugh. They have no runs on the board except for growing our debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I admit we have taken some very difficult decisions. This afternoon's question time dealt with the family tax benefit B changes. The reason we are making those changes is that we are trying to get people back into work. Someone has got to pay. That is what no-one seems to be prepared to say when they promise X, Y or Z because they think it is a good idea. They do not say who is going to pay, and the answer is, more often than not: it is the taxpayer. Currently, government securities on debt are over $402,636 million. That does not include residential backed mortgage securities, so you can put a bit on top of that as well. Thank God the Future Fund was isolated, because they would have spent that too. They did try back in 2012. They had a little nibble and tried to get a little bit, but fortunately they were not allowed to get hold of the Future Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">GDP growth at two per cent is meant to be a crime. That is fantastic if you realise that our economy is linked to China, which has had a massive slowdown. We have a huge linkage in the commodities and, of course, commodities have come off the boil because China has come off the boil. It is a no-brainer. So it is not that surprising. But job ads grew in August and September. Unemployment, despite all the losses in the mining sector is still level at 6.2 per cent. That is pretty good, considering. There have been 118,000 jobs created in last year. That is a good figure. The participation rate is up, at 65 per cent. So, even though we have got more people who are getting the confidence to go back into the economy, our unemployment rate is staying the same. We have got 900 jobs on the Pacific Highway— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The ATO has a substantial presence in Perth and, for the past 23 years, has been located in the building, where it has a lease in place. The ATO has substantially reduced the amount of space it will retain in Perth, in line with the agency's off-ramping strategy. The reduction in space equates to a saving of $59 million, excluding GST, over seven years, representing an excellent outcome for the Commonwealth.</span>

Subject to the approval of the project by the parliament, the fit-out is expected to commence in early 2016 with staged, practical completion scheduled from mid-2017.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  It is my great pleasure to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (More Generous Means Testing for Youth Payments) Bill. This bill is about standing up for rural and regional families, it is about fighting unfairness and it is about helping young people go to university or pursue other forms of tertiary study. It is about addressing a really terrible statistic that we have in our country at the moment where 25 per cent of young people live in regional Australia but only 18 per cent make it to tertiary education. One of the principal reasons that there is such a battle is the cost of moving to a metropolitan area to study, and it is not just the cost of study, it is actually the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on the terrible situation of when I was a candidate for Corangamite in 2009-10 when the Youth Allowance was absolutely botched by Labor. I heard the very excellent contribution earlier from the member for Forrest who was one of the leading advocates against Labor's Youth Allowance. After many, many months of campaigning and pointing out the terrible unfairness of what Labor had done it was overturned. Of course the problem was not fixed. For me, as a candidate back then, working particularly in Colac, which is a very important regional centre in my electorate, as it is now, there were many families who were angry and who felt completely left out in the cold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud of this bill because it demonstrates that, in contrast to members opposite, we place a huge priority on standing up for rural and regional Australia. I say that in the context of some of the debate we have heard in the House today, most particularly on the NBN. Now that we have announced our three-year NBN rollout, we are getting on with the business of delivering the NBN. Labor ran a hysterical campaign but the truth of the matter is that, under Labor's scheme, the rollout would have been delivered some six to eight years later. It would have cost around about $30 billion more and it would have left people in my electorate in the suburbs of Belmont, Highton, Waurn Ponds, Wandana Heights, Grovedale and Marshall out in the cold. When Labor's three-year rollout was announced when they were in government, the southern suburbs of Geelong—the biggest regional city in Victoria—was completely excluded. It was an absolute demonstration of a failure to care for those who most needed the government's help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the southern parts of Geelong there are many, many people and it is a very large growth area. There are many, many families who have not been able to access fast broadband. With the announcement last week that we are rolling out the NBN right across all of Corangamite and across all of the Geelong region, including the federal electorate of Corio, we are incredibly proud that we are getting on with the job of delivering the NBN. I want to make the point that the member for Corio has been, perhaps, a little bit fuzzy with the truth in relation to the representations he has made on this issue. He talked about parts of his electorate being on the rollout map. The former member for Corangamite Darren Cheeseman supported former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and then did the big U-turn and moved across to Kevin Rudd. So of course that caused a huge fiasco and left Corangamite out in the cold on many other issues. It was badly managed as not one contract in the federal electorate of Corio was signed, because any NBN contract that was signed was honoured. While there was some FTTP delivered in Armstrong Creek, not one contract in the federal electorate of Corio was ever signed. That is a really good example of families, seniors and young people being left completely out in the cold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another very telling example is our Mobile Blackspot Program with $160 million, and more to come, and we are investing in regional communities to fix mobile blackspots. I am incredibly proud that 10 of the mobile base stations are based in Corangamite. In relation to the carbon tax, not only was that a terrible tax for every household, but it was a shocking tax for farmers and manufacturers. It resonated so negatively throughout Corangamite, which is a fine agricultural region. Of course it is a great day in this House with the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement being passed. That is so symbolic of our government's focus on standing up for farmers, agriculture, agribusinesses, food processors, small businesses and exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it is wonderful to see that Labor has come to its senses after a dishonest campaign by the union movement with the Labor Party was just bobbing along in its wake. It did not pull up the union movement on some of its claims. I have to say that a couple of members opposite also made some terrible claims. But this is so symbolic of our capacity to stand up for regional Australia and to look at our future jobs growth and the opportunity to explore new markets. It is a great day. It is also a great day for young people, because this is a very important bill and it is a bill being supported by those opposite. I am very pleased about that. It is a bill that demonstrates, as I say, that once again we are standing up for young people and we are standing up for those who want to attend university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have heard, these measures aim to more closely align the parental means testing arrangements for youth allowance with the arrangements for family tax benefit part A. In introducing the measures, the government has recognised the need for a simpler, fairer youth income support system that focuses on families who need assistance. The measures acknowledge that low-income families, who were disadvantaged under the previous means testing arrangements due to duplication and multiple tests being applied concurrently, will no longer have that same level of disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was incredibly unfair to be including the assets of farming families in the test, families who may have had large or significant assets on paper—because of their ownership of a farm or a farming operation—yet who may have very little income and are struggling to meet the basics of raising a family. The new tests that are being put in place are very much welcome. We have heard that there perhaps is more work to be done, because we need to make sure that every young person—no matter where they live in Australia—has the same opportunities to go to university. Attending higher education is so critical. We must give our young people every possible opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, the family actual means test and the family assets test will be removed from the youth allowance parental means test arrangements. From 1 January 2016, this will make youth allowance parental means test arrangements consistent with those for family tax benefit part A, which has no family actual means test or family assets test. The family tax benefit part A family income test and the youth allowance parental income test do not apply where a parent is in receipt of an income support payment. However, the youth allowance parental income test includes additional exemptions, with youth exempted from the test where a parent concurrently hold to low-income healthcare card or is assisted via the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no strong policy reason for these additional exemptions. They will be removed by the measure. Most lower income parents will have qualified for exemption from the family and youth payments income test because they were eligible for and receiving an income support payment. Accordingly, parental income test exemptions for youth allowance will be aligned with existing arrangements for family tax benefit part A. On 1 January 2016, also maintenance income will be removed from the youth allowance parental income test pending further reform of maintenance income on 1 January 2017. Similar changes will be made to the ABSTUDY parental income test in the ABSTUDY policy manual.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those listening to the debate, some of these changes are difficult to follow because they are often very individually related to particular families. But the net result of this is that more young people will be able to access the youth allowance and that is absolutely fantastic. More young people will be able to go to university. It will mean the difference between thinking that they have missed out on a huge opportunity and going to university feeling that they have the support that they so deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to just add that from 1 January 2017, the treatment of child support will be further reformed by applying a maintenance income test to youth allowance parental income test, like that which is currently applying to family tax benefit part A. Child support payments are assessed differently for family tax benefit part A and youth allowance. The family tax benefit part A maintenance income test only takes into account the contribution of child support payers to the cost of children and young people attracting FTB part A for a parent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This contrasts with the current rules for youth allowance, which can double count the contribution non-resident parents through child support in some circumstances. This is because child support of all children is included in the parental income test regardless of whether the child is in receipt of youth allowance or not. Similar changes will be made to the maintenance income test for the ABSTUDY living allowance in the ABSTUDY policy manual.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, as I have spoken about, this bill demonstrates the government's focus on standing up for rural and regional Australia. I want to say that to all those families in Colac, Beeac and Birregurra, which are all parts of the west of my electorate. There is also a wonderful university my electorate, Deakin University, which is doing incredible work. It is being rapidly recognised as one of the best universities in Australia. It is dynamic and it is doing incredible work—particularly in future fibres—across all sectors of study: engineering, health sciences, law, commerce and medicine. I am incredibly proud of the university that I have my electorate and I am incredibly proud of this bill. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  For five years now, I have been a patron of the Belconnen Magpies Aussie Rules football club. It is a club with a proud history—originally known as Turner Football Club, then the Bees and then the Blues. Then, after its merger with the West Canberra Football Club, it became the Belconnen Magpies in 1987 and moved to its headquarters in Kippax in 1991. Although I have not gotten to as many games as I would like to this year, I did get out to 'The Nest' at Kippax to see the Magpies' convincing 118-35 victory against the Ainslie Tricolours on 29 August. The ACT AFL competition grand final was held on 19 September. Playing in both the first and second grade matches were, of course, the Magpies. Alas—despite a thrilling semifinal victory against Tuggeranong on 5 September—the first grade side was narrowly upset by Queanbeyan, 95-71. The Magpies second grade team also fought to the end, but ultimately went down to Tuggeranong 87-39.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014 year was a tough one for the Belconnen Magpies. Fighting in the highly competitive North East Australian Football League, success was elusive, and the club was ultimately relegated to the ACT AFL competition. The Magpies now find themselves towards the top of the pecking order in the ACT. The club has amply proven its worth and, during the entire normal season, the first grade side was undefeated. The players, staff and entire club—especially coach Jeremy Rowe—can be incredibly proud of their efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me indulge the House with a few of their season highlights. First and second grade both claimed minor premierships, finishing top of their respective ladders. Third and fourth grade missed out on making the finals, but each fought tough and creditable seasons. Statistically, the first grade side was by far the best attacking and the best defending team in the competition. In terms of individual achievements, first grader Chris York had a breakout season, kicking 80 'sausage rolls' in 15 games. Club stalwart Lex Bennett played his 200th first grade game for Belconnen against Queanbeyan on 30 May—only the sixth player in the club's history to achieve this milestone. The Magpies field teams in a range of divisions and in both genders. It was great to see them winning the girls youth competition, defeating Ainslie Black 21-10 in the grand final, with Alexia Hamilton winning best on ground for the Magpies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twelve Magpies players were selected for the 2015 AFL Canberra representative squad: James Bennett, Alexander Bennett, Ryan Turnbull, Daniel Jordan, Jack Baker, Dom Bunyan, Luke Wharton, Chris York, Isaac Taylor, Jacob Taylor, Daniel Posch and Ryan Bradley. Further afield, former Belconnen Magpie Jack Steele debuted in the AFL for Greater Western Sydney against North Melbourne on 19 June, putting in one of the team's best performances. In the women's sport, former Magpies player Elise O'Dea and current defender Heather Anderson were selected in the AFL women's draft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An improvement on their sometimes antisocial namesake, the Magpies have swooped on social causes this year, throwing the energy of the club behind a number of community initiatives. During their first set of home games, the Magpies collected donations for a rare cancers charity and held a minute's silence before each game, with players wearing black armbands in honour of Canberra mother Rachael Netting, whose husband, Paul, played more than 300 games for the Magpies. Rachael passed away earlier this year after a battle with cancer. During the match against Ainslie that I attended, the Magpies dedicated their games and a special function to raising funds for Lifeline Canberra. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At their presentation night on 17 October, a range of well-deserved awards were handed out. In the women's grade, I acknowledge Emma Hampton, Hannah Wallett, Melissa Campbell, Katie McGinty, Jess Sibley and Heather Anderson. In division 1, I acknowledge James Bennett, Chris York, Dom Bunyan, Daniel Jordan, Isaac Taylor, Lexie Bennett, Tim Smith and Jack Baker; in division 2, John Love, Ben Turnbull, Jon Dunn, James Kenna, Matthew Newman and Jeffrey Dowdell; in division 3, Josh Visser, Jeffrey Dowdell, Geoff Kay, Bradley Fleming, James Michelle and Jack Sheers; and in division 4, Rory Markham, Pat Ryan-Baker, Joe Quarmby, Tom Arthur and Eric Parkin. Among the rising stars, I acknowledge: Joshua Fitzpatrick, Elliott Jordan, Joey Pisciotta, Michael Pisciotta, Aiden Wenke and Aiden Ledson. For the plaque winners: the Frank Goddard Rising Star Award went to Luke Wharton, life membership went to Lex Bennett, the Len Sheedy Memorial Award went to Paul Gunn and the Alan Phillips Memorial Award went to Jeremy Foster. Inducted in the hall of fame were Brendan Read and Darren Denneman. The Rachael Netting Most Determined Award went to Melissa Campbell, and the Townley Award for Service to Senior Football went to Phil Batten. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope 2016 will bring even more successes. Perhaps a Magpies grand final win and a Labor election win in the same year. I cannot imagine a happier thing for a Canberra based Labor politician than to see a Shorten government and a Magpies victory in the same year.</span>

This weekend will see businesses, community organisations, sporting clubs and individuals come together for a heath check at the Rotary Club of Ulverstone West's Health and Wellbeing Expo. Together with Australian Rotary Health and beyondblue, the Rotary Club of Ulverstone West organises and hosts Tasmania's largest annual health and wellbeing expo for families in my electorate of Braddon and beyond. This event helps the community to connect and access both mental and physical health services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One in six people in Australia will experience depression at some stage in their lives and one in four will experience anxiety. This means that, in my electorate of Braddon alone, over 18,000 people have had, or are battling with, depression, and over 11,500 have experienced, or are dealing with, anxiety—staggering figures. Unfortunately, many of these people do not seek help, sadly leading, all too often, to suicide. Of the 65,000 Australians who attempt to take their own life each year, it is estimated that a high percentage are battling undiagnosed depression. I urge anyone who is battling with depression or suicidal thoughts to get in touch with beyondblue on 1300 22 46 36.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health and Wellbeing Expo happening in Ulverstone tomorrow provides the opportunity for members of the community to access free health and wellbeing information. Exhibitors at the expo will range from mental health services like beyondblue and Rural Alive &amp; Well, to physical health services like Hearing Australia and Lungs in Poor Shape, and community services like the central coast men's shed. In conjunction with this event, Mayor Jan Bonde of Central Coast Council will be the Hat Day ambassador for the event. Hat Day is an annual initiative of Australian Rotary Health, with money raised going to research helping Australians with mental illnesses. As Hat Day ambassador, Mayor Jan Bonde will use her impeccable taste to judge the hats that will be on display at the expo. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This expo is an important part of connecting our businesses, community organisations, sporting clubs and members of our community with each other to support each other and those around us. As part of this event, I look forward to joining members of the community at the sold-out beyondblue gala dinner on Saturday evening. Speaking to the 200-strong crowd, mental health guest speakers will be promoting awareness of all facets of mental health, including youth suicide prevention.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health and Wellbeing Expo and beyondblue gala has grown rapidly in the six years since it first began. I congratulate organiser, and my good friend, Lindsay Morgan and the whole team at the Rotary Club of Ulverstone West, beyondblue and Australian Rotary Health on what I am sure will be a fantastic event at the Ulverstone Civic Centre tomorrow from 10 am to 3 pm.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is well known that in October everything turns pink to raise awareness and money for breast cancer. Tomorrow in Burnie, Pink Ribbon stalls will be set up to collect donations and sell ribbons for the Cancer Council's research into better treatments and prevention of breast cancer, as well as for support services and prevention programs across the state.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day in Australia, around 50 women are told they have breast cancer or a gynaecological cancer. Sadly, around 12 Australian women will die each day from a women's cancer. I doubt there is a person in Australia or in this chamber, probably, who has not been affected by cancer, whether personally or through having a member of their family or a close friend or workmate being diagnosed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I am attending, along with many others in my community, the Unite in Pink Breakfast being held next Tuesday morning. This breakfast, hosted by local personality Katy Pakinga, is a chance for the community to come together to support Tasmanian women affected by cancer. We are joining together to support those who are currently fighting and those who have fought this horrid disease, whilst at the same time raising awareness and money so we may reduce the number of women who will have to fight this battle. I encourage anyone who can to buy tickets to this great event by calling 64258602 or visiting cancertas.org.au, or to support your local Pink Ribbon stall by making a donation—a good donation—or by buying and wearing a ribbon.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  A week can be a long time in politics, and this week the government announced their new package for Family Tax Benefit and their new plans to cut Family Tax Benefit for many, many families here in Australia. What we have learned today and in the past couple of days is who this change will impact. What the government is now proposing is: when the youngest child in these families turns 13, they will lose Family Tax Benefit part B—and you might remember that this policy was, first, when your youngest child turned six. That has now been knocked off, and the government has come back with a new plan to cut it when the youngest child turns 13. So it will see these families lose about $2,500 a year. These are low-income families—these are single parents; these are grandparents who are caring for grandchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In choosing the age of 13, does the government think that children become cheaper once they become teenagers? Anybody with teenagers will tell you that is not true. I myself do not have children, but, from the constituents who I have spoken to, children quite often, they tell me, become more expensive as they get older, as their needs and wants and school activities become more expensive, and as they start to become young adults and start to think about what they would like to do beyond school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that these changes are about workforce participation, and that this will encourage these families, these people who are currently at home caring for children, to re-enter the workforce. But it fails critical tests. Are there suitable jobs available? Will there be decent after-school care? What is the cost of that after-school care for families in this situation? We are already in the midst of a job crisis, particularly in regional areas where the availability of suitable part-time work is rare, particularly for people who are raising children. Quite often these families might work in hospitality or in retail, in aged care or in other caring professions. These are some of the other industries under attack by this government through proposals to cut penalty rates and proposals to make it harder for these people to get hours and to continue to work in their industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have heard today in Senate estimates and what we heard today in question time was that the department estimates that about 136,000 single parents will be affected by this change. There will also be about 4,000 grandparents who are carers will be affected by this change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to grandparents who are caring for their grandchildren, from what the minister has said on TV, in other media and in this chamber, I do not believe the minister understands who they are. Perhaps he has not met one. These people are the unsung heroes in our community. They are, by definition, caring for their grandchildren because their children are not able to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you meet these people they all have a story to tell, and it is usually from some quite heartbreaking circumstances that they have ended up becoming the primary carer of their grandchildren. On the weekend, when I was doorknocking in North Bendigo, I met a lively household; there was a grandmother, and four children running around: one was in high school, two were in primary school and the youngest was in kindergarten. I asked her what it was like this time around, and she said: 'It's a lot harder. I raised four of my own; now I have my four grandchildren to raise.' I asked about her daughter, and she said: 'To deal with the situation, I've had to become cold. I've had to cut my daughter off, because now I have to care for my four grandchildren. I'm a mother all over again. And it is harder the second time around: I'm not as fast; I'm not as young; and life is a lot more expensive these days.' Then there is Neil and his wife, caring for their granddaughter because they lost their daughter not that long ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are real people with real stories whom the government is now going after. They are unlikely to return to work because some had already retired; others have retired early to take care of their grandchildren. These are people who deserve our compassion and respect, not these cruel cuts that the government has put forward in this proposal. I call on the government to rethink this measure and change it before this House comes back together.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  So many Australians, including in my electorate of La Trobe, are greatly concerned about young people entering the path of violent extremism. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the men and women of the Parramatta police station, those involved in the awful incident where a young boy had been radicalised and shot a serving member. Endeavour Hills had the same situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violent extremism is an issue which people in my electorate have raised with me, asking, 'What can you do about it?' including from the Muslim community. I saw a lady by the name of Dr Anne Aly being interviewed on the Sky channel one night. Dr Anne Aly is an expert on counter-terrorism and she is a Muslim. I thought I should touch base with her. I asked, 'What would you recommend we do?' She said she has a program called MYHACK where they conduct a hack-a-thon, which involves young people coming up with ideas to stop other young people entering the world of violent extremism. I would love to thank Dr Anne Aly and also Alim Abdullahi and Sarah Awan for coordinating the MYHACK program in my electorate of La Trobe. We had three teams. It went for 48 hours and the teams came up with practical solutions of how to counter violent extremism. The three teams did an incredible job. I am proud to say that the Australian government contributed federal funding for this. We also had support from Google and other key sponsors. The concept was to pretty much come up with something to stop young people being radicalised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Project 1 called themselves The Loop. The Loop was designed to connect young Muslim teens with influential and like-minded role models—Loop ambassadors—to create a communal sense of inclusion and constructive goal-setting. This was a modern, innovative take on classical mentoring programs which allowed young Muslims to connect with influencers online, thus providing them with genuine alternatives to influencers like those in ISIS trying to get young people to be radicalised. They did a fantastic job with their project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second project to come out of Melbourne's MYHACK is called Podium. Podium is a content platform used to highlight and share creative forms of self-expression by Muslim youth. It provides a safe space for young Muslims to go, share their stories without fear of retribution and ask questions about their faith in a modern context. It was great. I was particularly impressed that the project has now been kindly sponsored by Infinitas Asset Management. They will merge it with a similar project in Perth. I would also like to thank PaVE for also getting involved to support Podium. They plan to take the team to Tokyo, Japan, with YouTube. PaVE stands for People Against Violent Extremism. Congratulations to group 2, who have clearly done a fantastic job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so excited about the winning project. They call themselves The Formers Network, or TFN. They came up with a fantastic initiative for people who have been involved in violent extremism, whether it be white supremacy or people who have become Muslim extremists—it does not matter. Their focus was to get formers and also victims to tell their stories on a website: why they do not want to go down the path of being an extremist and also with regard to being a victim. I again congratulate the Loop team, Olivia, Mohammad and Faseeha; and the Podium team, Jack, Farzana, Anushe and Eleanor; and The Formers Network, Connie, Gulsoom, Ali and Isobel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of parliament it was great to see predominantly young Muslim people get so excited and so involved in trying to make sure that they can be the change agents to stop other young Muslim people and other young people from being radicalised. It is absolutely fantastic. I am keen to work with Dr Anne Aly to get more of these projects in not only my electorate of La Trobe but all across Australia. This is such a fantastic way to stop violent extremism.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I would like to pay tribute to a good friend of mine who passed away on 15 October this year, Donald Wallace Livingstone. He was known as Don to all of us. Don was the Queensland state Labor member for Ipswich West from 1989 to 1998 and from 2001 to 2006. Don was born in Kingaroy on 1 October 1948. He left school at 14 years of age and came to Ipswich at the age of seven. He worked in a variety of different jobs. Working in the power industry, he became active politically and joined the union. He became a councillor, then known as an alderman, in the Ipswich City Council in 1985. He was elected on that great day in Labor history, 2 December 1989, when Wayne Goss ended 32 years of conservative rule in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Don's favourite sayings was, 'Hey, numbers beat logic any day.' I can recall him saying that on the way to state conference at his Yamanto home, with his grandchildren running around, over a cup of tea with a cinema-size TV facing him. I heard it from Don recently at St Andrews hospital in Ipswich and the Ipswich hospice as he courageously faced his mortality. With Don it was all about the numbers. He knew the numbers. He knew the number of dollars he needed as a state MP for Ipswich West for projects and community groups in his electorate. He knew the number of votes at each polling booth in Ipswich West at every election and how they voted, this way or that. He knew the numbers and the names of those he described as red-hot Tories. He was a master. For the Queensland state Labor conference, ballots, pre-selections, AGMs, branches and party units, Don certainly knew the numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite his illness and infirmity, recently he asked me back to his hospital bed so we could talk and check the numbers for a recent internal Labor Party AGM. Despite his failing health, he attended his own Ipswich northern suburbs branch because Don knew the numbers mattered. Don could be hard and tough, but he could be sentimental and emotional as well. He was devoted to his wife, Cheryl, his daughter, Karen, his son-in-law, Matt, his son, Graham, and his beloved grandchildren. He told me many times that his greatest regret in leaving this earth was that he would not be there to see his grandchildren grow up. His eyes always twinkled and became moist when he laughed and his voice would break.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was loved and loved in return. He loved his community. He was a great community champion. Yesterday, 300 people paid tribute to him, and I am pleased that I was there yesterday with the mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, his good friend, my campaign director, Peter Johnstone, and former Queensland cabinet minister Robert Schwarten, who paid tribute to Don's life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Don's successful stint as a campaign director in Ipswich, my first in-depth conversation with Don was when, curiously enough, Don asked me for his vote, even though I was involved in the Ipswich state electorate helping David Hamill win his seat—I actually lived and still live in Flinders View, in Ipswich West. When I told him I would have to speak to David about that, Don had a smile across his face because he knew that David was delivering the numbers for Don in Ipswich West. So he left my home in Flinders View very happy indeed, because he knew how I would vote. I accordingly cast my vote for Don in the preselection. It was then that an acquaintance became an alliance and I have been his political ally and factional mate for all of that time. He was a mate and a mentor to me and to many other Labor politicians in Ipswich.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who can forget Don in his four-wheel-drive out in the country with his good mate John Staines, 'Stainsey' to his friends, with Labor signs everywhere, street meetings, door knocking, trailer behind—you name it, this dynamic duo was everywhere. Both of them are probably now in political glory plotting the numbers and campaigns in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don was relentless, unyielding, dogged and determined—he was all of these things. The votes he got in rural communities was simply amazing for a Labor candidate. I wish I could get those numbers, I can assure you. At the last state election, Don was there in Ipswich with his good mate Barry and his son-in-law, Matt. I think at one stage everyone on Don's campaign seemed to have the Christian or given name Barry. On one of his better days recently Don said he was looking forward to the 2016 Ipswich City Council campaign because, 'I may have half a campaign in me yet.' So Don was campaigning till the very end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We loved Don. He was a mate. People opened up with him. Rest in peace, comrade. You have done the Labor Party and the union movement very well indeed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  Housing its people is a fundamental duty for every government. This is why, as chair of the House Standing Committee on Economics, I commenced a home ownership inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a free enterprise system the marketplace operates best when unrestrained by government. Some may argue that the marketplace should have no encumbrances at all from government. When the inquiry started, however, many advised that negative gearing should not be touched, the suggestion of the use of superannuation funds to buy a home was stupid, and more, all of which flew in the face of the very reason to hold such an inquiry in the first place. The reason was simply to get all the facts on the table so an informed course of action can be taken—comprehensive analysis not inhibited by ideology or self-interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument that negative gearing should not be tampered with finds perfection in the counter-argument that the government should not interfere with the marketplace. This is a convenient position for those in the marketplace who are already advantaged by such measures—or, interference, if you will. When the housing market has worked best, the major factors have counter-balanced to establish stability and the stakeholders reasonably contained to an appropriate place. In this ideal situation, the number of properties investors could purchase was limited by their capacity to fund negative gearing losses against other income. This provided affordable rental accommodation for those who could not buy property. Investors constrained by their funding capacity left abundant opportunity for home buyers to compete with each other for their piece of the Australian dream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when investors are advantaged by deductibility of all expenses and a preferable CGT discount, and home owners are not subject to CGT, and interest rates are significantly higher than rental returns, the housing market enjoys a stable period. It should be noted that the differences in tax treatment between investors and home buyers in no way equates to a free market and is far from a level playing field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, interest rates, at historically low levels, have had a profound impact on the housing market. We have seen the previous status quo destabilised by the uneven playing field now presenting a grade that is too steep for the home buyer. This impact has seen unsustainable price rises in major markets and the dominance of investors over home buyers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Real estate prices are driven by speculation on continuing price rises over rental returns, resulting in prices of properties having no fundamental economic basis. An increasing cohort of investors can now speculate, through their ability to acquire properties unlimited by negative-gearing costs, as their rental returns now exceed the low interest rates. However, many lack the capacity to fund any increases in holding costs, should interest rates rise. The resultant need to sell would no doubt drive a very significant event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such an event will have a very far-reaching impact, from the over-extended investor needing to sell large portions of their holdings urgently, to the new investors—the teachers, nurses, police officer and ambulance drivers—who have limited capacity to fund an increase in interest rates. Imagine a move from 4 per cent to 6 per cent—it is actually a 50 per cent increase. From the mortgage holder to the investor who has bought at the top of the market, to those who have lent, all are vulnerable to this highly volatile situation. It comes down to a matter of who needs to do what to avert a catastrophe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1996, the government authorised the RBA to act independently in regard to monetary policy, to contain inflation and to achieve stability of the currency, maintenance of full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. The lever, often referred to as a blunt instrument, was to set the prime cash rate. The problem of tension between these objectives, with one lever aimed at achieving a prime target, has often created a collateral impact contrary to the RBA's responsibilities. The RBA's actions to reduce interest rates to historic lows in order to maintain inflation within the prescribed range has created a collateral impact of over-stimulating the housing market, thereby producing this volatile situation. These interest rates have focussed investors not on rental returns but on rapidly rising prices, which speculates the price of homes out of the reach of many, who are reduced to renting and therefore funding the investors ever-increasing holdings. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  I rise today to speak in memory of two members of my constituency who have recently passed away. Denis and Daphne Guy grew up in adjacent villages in Hertfordshire, just north of London. During the Second World War, Denis trained as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, eventually joining No. 79 Squadron in Burma in the last weeks of the war. Although a RAF squadron, it contained many Australians and New Zealanders. The young Denis observed the way the Anzacs treated each other, concluding that they must come from a fairer and more humane society than the one in which he had grown up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the war, Denis stayed in the RAF, becoming a flying instructor, and married Daphne in 1947. They had a son and daughter, David and Diane. Denis spent two years recovering from TB and was then invalided out of the RAF, retraining as a technician in radio and, subsequently, television. In 1961, the family decided to emigrate to Australia. Denis and Daphne were compelled by their sense that Australia offered economic and educational opportunities, especially for their children. They were right. David and Diane both attended John Curtin High School and the University of Western Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Denis chose to settle in Perth because of its favourable climate—and he was right there too, because despite his earlier health problems he lived healthily until the age of 89. When the Guy family arrived in Fremantle, television was an exciting new technology and jobs were plentiful. The family lived in rental accommodation in central Fremantle but worked hard to save the deposit for a home. It was a time of financial strain, but the family recalls a household characterised by affection and laughter. At weekends they would go to the Winterfold estate in Beaconsfield and see what progress had been made on their new house, which they were able to occupy in 1963. Denis and Daphne spent the rest of their lives there while Denis worked for various television repair firms and Daphne was employed in the accounts section of the Mills and Ware biscuit company. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This story could be repeated countless times in my electorate and across this country, yet I would urge members to hold it in their minds as we go about our work. Denis and Daphne Guy were not famous or rich, but their contribution to my electorate and this country should be acknowledged and celebrated. Without the efforts of ordinary citizens like these—native-born or from elsewhere—nothing we do or say here can have any affect beyond it. We need to retain those qualities of Australian life and values which attracted Denis and Daphne as migrants to this country so many years ago. Their lives here reflected an implicit social contract—this country offering its citizens, old and new, opportunity and acceptance in return for hard work and social commitment. That contract must be reaffirmed by every generation of Australians and reflected in our work as representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently a simple and low-key commemoration of the lives of Denis and Daphne Guy was held in the family home with many of the people who knew them well. I am proud to have represented them here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="FU4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  I rise today to offer my support to, and raise awareness of, an important campaign in my electorate—the Grass Ceiling campaign. The campaign has been the brainchild of the wonderfully proactive mayor of the Bayside City Council, Felicity Frederico. In Bayside, one of the two municipalities in my electorate of Goldstein, 80 per cent of the sporting infrastructure was constructed before the 1960s—an era when female sport received very little attention. As a result, 96 per cent of the pavilions within Bayside do not have adequate female change facilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a major imbalance between supply and demand for sporting facilities. The Bayside municipality has 44 ovals yet only seven netball courts. This leads to over 200 netballers having a forced bye every weekend. What message does this send to young girls who aspire to play sport? Not only does it mean that a large percentage of existing netballers cannot play weekly; it also means there is no scope for growth in female participation. While this is a major issue in my electorate, I am also aware that the situation is replicated throughout our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has to change. The playing field must be levelled. If this issue is left to conventional drip-feed funding, a whole generation of females will miss out on local sporting opportunities, as it would take at least 15 years for a transformation to occur. We know how important it is for children and teenagers to be active. Communities are responding to calls to increase youth participation in sport. It is now up to governments to act on this too, by ensuring that we have the facilities to meet the demand for quality sporting fields for everyone, irrespective of gender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to read that the Victorian Minister for Sport, John Eren; the Victorian shadow minister for sport, Damian Drum; and the Victorian shadow minister for women, Georgie Crozier, have all agreed that this issue is important, and they have requested the reinstatement of the meeting of sport and recreation ministers as a COAG ministerial council, and for this issue to take precedence. As the member for Goldstein, I agree with this call and would also like to see this added to the COAG Health Council as a health initiative. This issue transcends party lines as well as levels of government. It requires bipartisanship and discussion between all three levels of government. It has my full support, and I will continue to pursue this matter with parliamentary colleagues at a federal level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mayor Frederico for raising awareness of this inequity which exists today. I would also like to thank the <span style="font-style:italic;">Leader</span> newspaper and their parent company, News Corp, for campaigning for action on this issue. They have put great effort into this issue. With the support of three levels of governments, I am confident we can see positive action.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  This morning I want to inform the House about a trial that I am seeking to establish for a Greater Geelong youth council, which would be a forum for constituents living in the electorate of Corio who are aged between 15 and 25. The aim of trying to establish a Greater Geelong youth council is to provide young people with an opportunity to engage on a regular basis with me as their local member of parliament. Unlike other constituent or community organisations, there are few opportunities for young people to voice their concerns and ideas and to lobby their local politicians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greater Geelong youth council would comprise two students from each secondary school and two students who are in higher education or employment. This forum would provide an excellent opportunity for students to develop their leadership skills and gain confidence and would give them voice to create positive change in their community. I will be writing to the principals of Clonard College, Covenant College, Geelong Baptist College, Geelong Grammar School, Geelong High School, Kardinia International College, Lara Secondary College, Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College, Nelson Park School, Newcomb Secondary College, North Geelong Secondary College, Northern Bay College, Sacred Heart College, Saint Ignatius College, St Joseph's College, The Geelong College, Western Heights College, and Deakin University and The Gordon. In doing so, I will be asking them to nominate two students, one to act as a delegate to the Greater Geelong youth council and one as an alternative who lives in the electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greater Geelong youth council will aim to convene the first meeting of this council in the 2016 calendar school year, with the help of our local principals, a number of whom have expressed their support for this idea of establishing a Greater Geelong youth council as a way to better convey the worrying concerns that local students have about their communities and schools. This council will provide an invaluable perspective of the youth of Corio and will help in bringing the concerns of future generations to the attention of me as a federal parliamentarian. The Greater Geelong youth council and its trial will be organised through my office. We are keen to commit to an initial meeting next year and to hear the views of those local students. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining to me, I would also like to take the time to wish students currently sitting exams and coming to an end of their secondary education the best of luck. I am sure they will make an outstanding contribution to Geelong and the Greater Corio electorate in their future careers. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Geelong Advertiser</span> at the moment is running a series of stories on the stress of VCE exams and ATAR scores called 'Worried sick'. I would like to tell all the students heading into their final exams that, while they are of course very important, life will go on once they are over, no matter what happens. I, as the member for Corio, and indeed the wider community are all supporting you. Good luck.</span>

The events will be a performance of a project entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">War </span><span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">etters</span>, which involves taking letters written by World War I soldiers and putting them to music. The two concerts to be held at Ku-ring-gai Town Hall are designed to share this important element of our history with the residents of Bradfield, with the second concert in particular targeted at schoolchildren. This project is a touching and thoughtful way to convey the memories and experiences of World War I soldiers to a modern audience. I want to congratulate Diana Blom, Elliot Gyger, Nicole Murphy and Larry Sitsky, the composers whose work will be performed, and I also want to acknowledge the work of Western Sydney University for their coordinating role in this project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rationale for the project is that letters written by those who were serving in World War I can offer us today a unique and important insight into their personal experiences and in turn into the devastating and transformative impact of World War I. This project has been funded under the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program and received $25,000. I want to congratulate the Bradfield Centenary of Anzac committee for their support of this important project and a number of other projects, and I particularly want to mention Major Rod White AM, RFD (Retd), who was chair of the committee, and Lt Col. Ken Broadhead (Retd), who was secretary of the committee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, the Centenary of Anzac is an exceptionally important national milestone because it marks the 100th anniversary of an event of enormous significance to Australia's national identity, the battle on the Gallipoli peninsula, where Australian and New Zealand forces came ashore in April 1915. Across Australia, throughout our communities we are in many ways commemorating and marking this important anniversary and reflecting on its significance to contemporary Australia, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">War Letters</span> project and the concerts to be held shortly in my electorate of Bradfield are important parts of that recognition. I encourage residents of Bradfield to attend these important concerts.</span>

The breakfast was called to celebrate the winners of the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science, and it was a real honour and privilege to meet those winners. I did not get the chance to see them last night because I was at another event. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to send congratulations to Professor Graham Farquhar for winning the Prime Minister's Prize for Science; Laureate Professor Graeme Jameson for winning the Prime Minister's Prize for Innovation; Dr Jane Elith for winning the Frank Fenner Prize for Life Scientist of the Year—it is great to see a woman there, Madam Deputy Speaker; Associate Professor Cyrille Boyer for winning the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year; Rebecca Johnson for winning the Prime Minister’s Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools; and Ken Silburn for winning the Prime Minister’s Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus of the last two awards is on education, and it was wonderful to meet with a number people from the Academy of Science who are engaged in a range of programs to bring science literacy to students at the high school level, at the primary school level and also at the preschool level. I spoke to Professor Denis Goodrum and his colleagues about Primary Connections, a program that has been going for 10 years which gives schools a range of resources and takes science students at primary school. Not only does it provide schools and teachers with their resources, it also gives teachers the skills to teach science. They are also piloting the Little Scientists program, which is based on a German model where very little children are introduced to the joys of science. I also heard about the Science by Doing program, which is also a fantastic program rolled out at the high school level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the breakfast I also had a chance to meet with a number of people who are involved in the early to mid-range career programs, particularly the SAGE program, which is targeting gender inequity for women in science. It was great to hear about the real advances they have made, particularly in getting greater appreciation and acknowledgement of women's career breaks in the ARC grant process and also in the other activities they are involved in to address the brain drain that we have here in Australia, particularly for those early to mid-career scientists. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was pointed out to me, science is life; it is not just for scientists. We are engaged in it in every way every day. It was wonderful to meet these extraordinary Australian scientists this morning.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  Some weeks there are events that make you proud to be an Australian and proud to be part of a strong community. There was an event last week at the Port Macquarie Swimming Club in the Lyne electorate that was an explosion of goodwill. The swimming club has been a great institution, producing many great swimmers over many years and forming strong young athletes over the decades, including world champions. Last week the Port Macquarie Swimming Club showed their community spirit by getting behind Tom Berryman in his fight against a rare and aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Port Macquarie Swimming Club put together a fun night to raise funds to help support Tom and his family. The club raised over $5,000 through 'a swim for Tom'. In this 'swim for Tom', patrons paid to come and swim a few laps for Tom. Tom is a highly accomplished swimmer and a great example of the resilience of our young people in this country. Tom started swimming at the age of 15 as a way to help with his asthma, but within his first year of competitive swimming he had made the state team. The next year Tom went on to represent Port Macquarie Swimming Club at a national level and he was training up to 15 times a week—in the morning, at lunchtime and after school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tom noticed a pain in his arm in the lead-up to the national age championships but continued to train. Even with this unknown pain, he pulled off two silver medals, which was amazing. Soon after that, however, he had a large tumour removed from under his arm and has been undergoing chemotherapy. Tom is still training and hoping to have his fitness back up to that same level so that he can make the national championships in Adelaide this coming March. I offer my great congratulations and admiration to Tom, his family, the Port Macquarie Swimming Club and all the people who jumped in the pool to raise funds for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my unfortunate duty to also bring to the attention of the House the passing of one of our local community's true gems. The beautiful Pam Yates left this earth after 70 years. I had known Pam for four years. She was a gem of a lady, a wonderful wife, grandmother, mother and surrogate mother to so many other children who have passed through the Yates household, whether in the Newcastle district, Bathurst, Port Macquarie or Alstonville. She was a lovely lady and everyone in the community knew her. I offer my condolences. We would like to publicly support Bill, because he is a gem of a bloke too, and Todd, Adam, Kirk and Karen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  I rise today in the House to acknowledge World Polio Day. World Polio Day is a very important occasion aimed at highlighting the need for the international community to focus on eradicating polio. Eradication is very close to being achieved, but there are still some final steps that need to be made to ensure that it occurs. If you go back to 1988, more than 350,000 people were stricken by polio every year. There were nearly a thousand new polio cases every day across some 125 countries. To many people in Australia, polio is something we hear about from overseas, but it was not that long ago that polio was a scourge in the Australian community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time we have seen, through the work of Rotary and through the work of a range of international organisations, an integrated campaign and effort to deal with this issue internationally. We have now reached the situation where there has been a reduction of some 99.9 per cent in polio cases, which is phenomenal. Members may be aware that there has only really been one disease which has been eradicated in our time, and that was smallpox. But we are now on the cusp of achieving the same with polio. That is why it has to be a focus. There are only two countries that have not eradicated polio—Afghanistan and Pakistan. It has now been over a year since a case has been reported in Africa. We can see that enormous strides have been made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing to remember is that with a disease such as polio, if you take your foot off the throat of this disease, it will re-occur. You have to put the infrastructure in place, you have to educate the communities and you have to keep the funding up to ensure that this disease is eradicated. That is where the Australian government has to play its role. We have a great reputation internationally as a contributor to campaigns such as this, but we have to maintain that commitment. We cannot look at it and say that it is under control and therefore it is now somebody else's problem to deal with. We have to play our role. If we play our role, as part of an international community and as part of a partnership between the private sector and government, we will see this disease defeated. We should also understand that the provision of the infrastructure to ensure that this disease is dealt with will provide an ongoing legacy for the poor communities who suffer from this incredibly debilitating disease.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr STONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I rise to tell the parliament and, through it, to remind the Australian people about the great work of a very old company, the food manufacturer Nestle. Nestle has a dairy factory in the Goulburn Valley in my electorate of Murray in Tongala—a small town of 1,800 people. Nestle acquired this factory in 1971 through a merger of Ursina-Franck, makers of Tongala brand dairy products in Australia. Nestle manufacturing began as a condensed milk company in 1866 in Switzerland. In 1867, the company developed Farine Lactee, the first manufactured infant food in the world. In 1908, their first Australian branch opened. Nestle and Tongala went through some difficult times in the recent millennium drought, but it has resurged to now be a place of real product innovation, excellence and export.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I once had a conversation in Japan with some confectionery manufacturers who prided themselves in producing some of the world's most sought-after fudge. I explained the name and nature of the economy of my electorate of Murray and they said, 'Of course, we know the region well.' Indeed, they regularly visited it. I was more than surprised, until they explained that they sourced what they long ago assessed as the world's highest quality condensed milk from a dairy factory in the small village of Tongala. They explained that, while the world had moved to condensed milks made from powders and other additives, the Tongala Nestle factory still made their condensed milk from whole fresh milk of the highest quality. This is why they stated they could make the world's best fudge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, Nestle invested $17 million to expand the Tongala factory with a new liquid-manufacturing unit. This transformed them into a state-of-the-art facility for Nestle's health science business as a manufacturing hub for Oceania, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. So Nestle Tongala now make specialised medical nutrition products, including hospital-grade supplements and tube-feeding solutions. These are used also in aged-care homes. And they also make the special packs for Maggi Stir Fry—to put real magic into your cooking—and they have just won an award for their packaging of these special products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tongala has world-class food manufacturing capability, quite clearly. Besides the 110 full-time workers in this Nestle factory, just up the road there is a world-class export abattoir, Greenham &amp; Sons, who supply ground beef for USA's hamburgers. And, now, there is a new liquid fertiliser production plant, SLTEC, that is innovating to provide new product for the cereal and horticulture sectors. Tongala is a tiny town. There are fewer than 2,000 people, but they have this extraordinary manufacturing capacity. They are exporting to the world. The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement comes as a very welcome addition to the recent Japan and Korea agreements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also congratulate Tongala' marvellous aged-care facility, which is under the management of a marvellous woman, Jean Courtney, and a volunteer board. All strength to Tongala, may every Australian country town be known for its excellence and be applauded.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  The Prime Minister BC—before the coup—in his previous incarnation as communications minister, promised all Australians they would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. I know you would know that, Deputy Speaker, because it is on page 6 of the coalition's April 2013 policy document, <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he coalition's plan for fast broadband and an affordable NBN</span>. On current estimates released by the government, the people of Moreton will be waiting until 2018 to get Mr Turnbull's second-rate NBN. Not only is the NBN rolling out slower than promised; it is much more expensive. The original costings for the second-rate NBN were $29.5 billion, as priced in the April 2013 document. The cost has now ballooned to $56 billion. Malcolm's mangled monster has doubled in cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreton residents are concerned about the very poor internet service they have at present, and further delay adds insult to injury. Under Labor's NBN, 93 per cent of homes and businesses would have been provided with the super-fast version of the NBN: fibre-optic cable delivering speeds of one gigabit per second. Mr Turnbull's second-rate version promised every home and business access to 25 megabits per second by the end of 2016. Mr Turnbull has failed to live up to even that second-rate promise. The Abbott-Turnbull government have managed, in under two years, to increase the deficit, increase unemployment and spoil the NBN, the device that was going to boost productivity for so many Australians. My Moreton constituents will be paying twice as much for a service that is nowhere near as good as the Labor plan and is taking longer to deliver. The Liberal government is talking about the future but still living in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The internet is now an integral part of our lives. We rely on it every day. Our business communications are mostly through the internet, via email. Australia Post knows this. Social media is now a big part of our lives. We connect to our peer groups through that medium on a regular basis, at work and at home. Services are becoming more accessible remotely through the availability of Skype and other face-to-face videoconferencing. There are huge benefits to remotely accessing services such as health—not just to people in remote areas, even in suburban Brisbane. Time is saved through less travel and less congestion on the roads for people in suburban areas like Moreton. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These services are available in some industries now, and they will become much more common when we all have access to high-speed internet. Sadly, that will not be by the end of 2016, as promised by Mr Turnbull as communications minister. For some people in my electorate, this will not be until 2018 and beyond—and Moreton is a suburban seat! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am having a briefing with representatives from nbn co later today to ask them what they can do for my constituents, who will be left with a very poor internet connection for another three years. This is a shame.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  It is my pleasure to rise today and take this opportunity to acknowledge the terrific hard work of our volunteer firefighters in our Rural Fire Service, who are at this moment busily preparing for the bush fire season. In my electorate of Forde we have four rural fire brigades, with teams at Ormeau, Chambers Flat, Cedar Creek and Coomera Valley, providing a range of services to keep their local communities safe. In Queensland we have more than 36,000 Rural Fire Service volunteers. We often say volunteers are the heart and soul of a community, and the volunteers at the Rural Fire Service in my electorate are testament to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a perception that the main role of a rural fire brigade volunteer is active firefighting, but the job is so much more. Fire prevention is a big part of being a rural firefighter, with volunteers often undertaking a range of planning and preparation activities throughout the year, including hazard reduction burns to minimise the potential for bushfires getting out of control. But our rural firies also play an important role in community education. Timely and effective fire prevention and education save lives. Rural fire brigade members deliver a variety of community education programs, from spreading the 'Prepare. Act. Survive.' bushfire survival message; to their Safehome initiative to assist householders in recognising fire and safety hazards in and around the home. On top of this, our rural firefighters control the use of fire with specific permits and respond to outbreaks of fires within their local area as well as surrounding areas in support of other rural fire brigades and emergency service workers. Rural Fire Service volunteers can often be seen on deployment to assist other states during fire disasters and help other emergency service agencies during events of flood and storms. It is a tough job, but I am glad that we have some amazing volunteers and wardens at the rural fire brigades in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firefighting and fire prevention are a difficult task, but it can be made easier in the lead-up to the bushfire season if families have home evacuation and emergency plans in place. Whether you live in the city, the suburbs or the rural parts of my electorate, now more than ever it is important to have a bushfire survival plan. Your plan will detail how you can prepare and what action to take if threatened by a bushfire. A well-prepared plan can save lives, and it will also help our rural fire brigade volunteers, who risk their lives to save yours. Please get in touch with your local rural fire brigade to prepare your bushfire survival plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Throughout my electorate there are thousands of passionate activists concerned about the effects global poverty has on millions of people across the world. I am pleased to regularly meet with people from the Oaktree foundation; Vision Generation, World Vision Australia's youth movement; Oxfam; CBM Australia; Leprosy Mission Australia; the TEAR action group; and a range of local churches and community groups united by their commitment to alleviate poverty. They regularly raise their concerns about Australian commitment to foreign aid. They have been devastated by the successive cuts to Australia's foreign aid budget since 2013. The millennium goal of reaching a foreign aid commitment of 0.5 per cent of GNI seems further and further out of reach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Eastern Suburbs TEAR Action Group took the time to bake the most delicious and beautiful cake, carefully cut and labelled into a pie chart of the federal budget expenditure. Unless you were on an extreme diet, if someone were to hand you the slice of foreign aid at a birthday party, it would be nothing short of a massive insult. Indeed, it was so small that it was almost impossible to actually wedge it out of the cake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While our foreign aid budget remains a significant issue with all of these groups who are meeting with me, they have a second growing concern: the impact of climate change on the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. In 2013, more than six million children died before their fifth birthday. Forty-five per cent of these deaths were caused by malnutrition. Right now, 165 million children around the world are suffering from malnutrition. While these people desperately need our aid and assistance, they also need our urgent action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is the greatest challenge in the fight against hunger and poverty. While climate action affects us all, the effects on poverty-stricken nations and people are devastating. In the Pacific, climate change is a threat to the very survival of some nations as a result of the increased destruction and impacts of cyclones, rising sea levels and shifting weather patterns. The likelihood of more frequent El Nino events means that longer, more severe droughts have the potential to devastate food production. Extreme weather causes extreme hunger.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a responsibility to act on climate change for ourselves and for people who have no voice. We need to join the cause for climate justice. We must act to reduce emissions by at least 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025 and at least 65 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030; provide greater assistance for international climate finance, mobilising $100 billion by 2020, as many nations have; support a stronger and fairer 2020 global climate agreement in Paris, which includes guarantees of adequate funding for adaption in poorer countries; and support a package for those at risk of displacement from climate change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  The Northern Territory government is responsible for the management and the delivery of the Palmerston Regional Hospital project. Under the agreement, the Commonwealth makes payments against agreed and achieved milestones for that project. The Commonwealth is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the project. The most recent payment was $35 million for the commenced construction milestone, which was paid on 7 October 2015 and had nothing to do with the first concrete pour of the project, the stairwell fittings that occurred last Friday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As reported by department officials in yesterday's Senate estimates hearings, the Northern Territory government provided a range of evidence in relation to achievement of this milestone. This included but is not limited to Lend Lease being engaged as the managing contractor; early design documentation; project schedules; Lend Lease joining the design team, with formal novation of the design team to Lend Lease occurring in September; and commencement of work on on-site clearing and remediation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that Senator Peris is the puppet of her staffer running for the seat of Solomon and is the one who is staging political stunts, hysterically claiming the Commonwealth has paid $56 million for a covered-up hole, which is a lie. Senator Peris has become an expert in construction! Instead of rationally getting the facts from Lend Lease or anybody else, she has made outrageous claims of fraud by the Commonwealth, which is another lie. Here is a message for Senator Peris and her puppeteer: Lend Lease are the site managers and have responsibility for ensuring the safety of the site; how they do that is a matter for them, not for you, Senator Peris, as a politician.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were concerns about unauthorised access resulting in serious injury. Did you want them to ignore that, Senator Peris? That is the major question. Lend Lease have an excellent reputation for building hospitals across the country, and that is one of the reasons why they were selected. Senator Peris, if you were ever in Darwin, you would note all the roadworks and other activities associated with the hospital's construction—but that's right; you are never there. Stop your scaremongering and your political stunts. The Palmerston hospital is being built, and there is nothing you can do about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one last point. Under the current agreement between the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth, the next payment of $20 million will be paid upon completion of the building base, which is due in May 2016. I suppose that there will be another political stunt by you, Senator Peris, orchestrated by your puppeteer. Senator Peris, if you really care about your community, why don't you try living there?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Just over a week ago, I had the privilege of visiting the Northern Health Epping campus, the Northern Hospital site, with my great friend the member for McEwen, Rob Mitchell, and the member for Ballarat, Labor's health spokesperson. Together we engaged with local stakeholders to talk about the state of community health services and health infrastructure in the growing communities of Melbourne's north and, in particular, the electorate of Scullin and of course the neighbouring electorate of McEwen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During our visit we were able to tour the new three-storey wing of the Northern Hospital that is presently under construction, which will provide an additional 32 in-patient beds at the Northern but also, importantly, allow additional capacity for further expansion for surgical and intensive-care-unit beds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also able—and this was particularly exciting for me—to see the benefits that are being realised at the Northern Centre for Health Education and Research. This was a Labor initiative, and I was very privileged to attend its sod-turning as the Labor candidate for Scullin with Minister Plibersek. This facility has enabled Northern Health to train an additional 700 health professionals in Melbourne's north. More graduates across all areas who are now wanting work and continuing to build careers in health in the northern suburbs are selecting placements at the Northern. This deals with a long-running professional health workforce shortage, so it is fantastic to see for the growing communities of Melbourne's north. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a great opportunity to show off to Labor's health spokesperson what this is doing for outer-suburban health care. While investment and infrastructure are critical elements of building and maintaining an effective, world-class healthcare system, consultation and listening to the lived experience of workers on the ground is also key. That is why I brought along the shadow minister—to consult with the key stakeholders in Melbourne's outer northern suburbs, including Phillip Bain, CEO of Plenty Valley Community Health; Mary Agostino and Russell Hopkins from the City of Whittlesea; Siva Sivarajah and Colin Sussman from Northern Health; Jemal Ahmet from Whittlesea Community Connections; Helen Riseborough from Women's Health in the North; and Max Lee from the Hume Whittlesea Primary Care Partnership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really interested in bringing together these people to share with the shadow minister for health how important local partnerships have been not only in engaging with the complex needs of a rapidly growing, culturally and linguistically diverse community but also in ensuring that the best primary health care can be delivered through breaking down silos. I think these conversations will lead to more effective healthcare delivery under a future Labor government as well as build better understanding of the respective roles of local, state and federal government in building and maintaining healthy communities. I thank all involved for their efforts in sharing their experiences and enabling me to better represent the communities of Melbourne's north.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I am pleased to highlight this morning a couple of fantastic organisations in my local electorate. Last Saturday, 17 October, I was privileged to attend the Oatley Lions Oatley Village Festival. The festival has been running for 38 years, and for a number of those years it has been led by the Oatley Lions president, Bryan Pirie. The festival is a major event in our community. More than $35,000 was raised at the festival on Saturday, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to that by running the chocolate wheel for an hour or so. We had some very enthusiastic purchasers of raffle tickets, and it was a great day. There were 160 stalls—food stalls, craft stalls, novelty stalls and all sorts of great stalls. I also want to thank the many local businesses that supported the event by offering raffle prizes and undertaking other activities. Many local cafes, real estate agents and various other businesses supported the festival, and it was terrific. The Oatley Lions are one of the most significant organisations in our community. These events do not happen easily—they happen because of the hard work and dedication of, frankly, a small number of people who put on a very large event that tens of thousands of people benefit from. To Oatley Lions, to Bryan Pirie, thank you very much for what you have done for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank Learning Links for its contribution to our area. Learning Links is based in Peakhurst, in the electorate of Banks, but has activities all around Sydney. I recently met with the new CEO, Birgitte Maibom, and discussed the activities of the organisation. Learning Links has been in place since 1972 and has focused on providing education and related services to children with particular needs. Some of those needs relate to additional psychological support for children who are having difficulties in school, and a range of other activities as well. They help kids with autism, dyslexia, fine and gross motor skill delays and a range of other conditions. Learning Links is a very well respected organisation in our community. It has been providing great service for more than 40 years. To all of the team at Learning Links, thank you for what you do for our area and long may it continue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Just over two years ago, in the lead-up to the last federal election, we had the former leader of the Liberal Party come down to Tasmania with his candidates and his Liberal senators promising a runway extension for Hobart airport in my electorate. You can imagine my surprise, two years later, in estimates this week when we asked some questions about this runway. Senator Carol Brown asked about the progress of this $38 million promise of more than two years ago, particularly in light of what happened with the Cadbury's promise during the same period. You can imagine our surprise when we were told that to date, at this stage, 'just over $1 million has been paid'—just over $1 million of $38 million for the extension of the runway. It is surprising, because I understand this runway construction is going to take about two years to complete. Eric Abetz said the 'extended runway could be operational in early 2016.' This is clearly nothing more than a joke. It was clearly nothing more than an announcement by the Liberals in the lead-up to the last federal election campaign. It would appear that they had been doing nothing constructive to assist the Hobart airport corporation to ensure this runway extension occurs. Indeed, there is no sign of any construction work. We understand there has been no tender announced to date. There is no detailed design, no contractor in place, no schedule for works. We still do not know when this runway extension is going to occur and the date for completion. This runway extension is critical to Hobart, and indeed our local newspaper has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is increasingly a cause for concern that more than two years after $38 million was pledged to extend the runway … there remains no sign of the project on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $38 million was, originally, supposed to be paid in three stages: $5.5 million in 2014-15, $26 million in 2015-16 and $6.4 million in 2016-17. For only $1 million to have been paid out to date shows that the government is not getting on with the important job of the extension to the Hobart runway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes on top of another revelation during estimates this week about rail in Tasmania. In the lead up to the last election Labor had a commitment of $240 million for freight rail in Tasmania—this was promised by state and federal Labor. We understand that the Tasmanian Liberal government only put a project to the federal government of half that. So Tasmania is also missing out on more than $120 million of freight rail money because the Tasmanian Liberal government put up a project of smaller scope. I quote the department official who said in estimates:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Tasmanian government returned with a smaller scope of $119 million for the project …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When there was $240 million on the table for much-needed rail improvements in Tasmania, we are only getting $119 million. So, the runway is not happening and the rail upgrade is behind.</span>

I would like to congratulate Peter Nicholson from Nicholson Fine Foods. Peter is based in Yamba and has just won five awards at the recent Sydney Royal Fine Food Show. The company's Euro-style spiced beetroot finishing vinegar won the gold medal and then went on to win the savoury food champion award as well as being named the overall Australian champion after earlier picking up an award from the Royal Hobart Fine Food Awards—quite a stunning result. But the company was not finished at the Sydney Royal, where they also picked up a gold medal for their savoury pickled cherries and bronze for their spiced raspberry finishing vinegar. Well done, Peter. I have sampled many of their products, and they are a great company.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clarence Valley teenagers Carly Leeson and Amy Riddell played important roles to help the Australian under-18 girls indoor cricket side to victory in the recent Junior World Series. Australia defeated New Zealand 132 to 115 in the tournament final played in Brisbane. Carly was the captain of the side. When Australia batted, Amy entered the fray in the second batting pair. Amy and her partner put Australia in a strong position, scoring 76 runs from their eight overs. By the time Carly walked out to bat in the last pair, Australia needed just two runs to draw level. Well done girls.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  Moss Vale Public School in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales is a part of my electorate. Whenever I have visited the school I have found them to be a school that is made up of a diverse student body and caring parents and teachers, and a school that is very engaged with the community. They are driven by a community of parents, teachers and students who really care about the world around them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted earlier this year to receive a package from them with some suggestions about what a new Australian flag might look like. I think those suggestions should be carefully considered. They offered not only lots of fantastic and colourful designs but also lots of great stories. I want to take this opportunity to thank Tyler Doughty, Riley Kenny, Safiya Apostolatos, Samantha Roberts, Byron Shaw, Belinda Lawrence, Ellen Hawthorn, Cooper Neale, Adele Semmler, Tanya Baxter, Thomas Anderson, Kate Rich, Isabella Fitch, Jessica Jobe, Arianna Stone, Riley Simpson, Eva Sabatier, Riley Tozer, Brandon Field, Brielle Sheather, Regan Daley and Shiarra Waugh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The students had some very interesting things to say. Tyler said that he had heard that New Zealand were about to change their flag and thought that we should get in on the action. He reckons ours needs to be updated because it is 114 years of old and—let's be honest—nobody looks so good after 114 years. Riley Kenny—there are actually quite a few Riley's in the class—simply said that we should change the flag because it was boring and had too many blue stars. We do not have to agree with all the comments the kids made, but I am really pleased they are engaging with issues such as this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile Byron reckons that our flag does not represent the cultural diversity of modern Australia, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Samantha, who is 10, also agrees that representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is lacking. She also thinks that the Union Jack should go because we are not ruled by Britain anymore. Sophia says that changing to a new flag would be a lovely change and that a flag with some kangaroos and the inclusion of the colours red, black and yellow would be a top idea. Brielle also agrees with the point about representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and further points out that the current version lacks a bit of colour. Brandon does not think there should be too much change at all. He wants to keep the Southern Cross, but he wants to incorporate some recognition of the First Australians. There are plenty of ideas. I cannot get through all of the contributions here, but I wanted to thank the students for sending them through to me and to tell them I am really engaged with the suggestions and ideas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):   Members in this place represent a broad spectrum of community involvement, with many different backgrounds represented. The diversity of our communities is often understated. However, last Saturday, when I participated in McHappy Day festivities, I was reminded of the community spirit in my electorate of Dobell. McHappy Day does a great job in raising funds for Ronald McDonald House charities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> On the Central Coast, Gosford Hospital hosts the Ronald McDonald Family Room. Families who have a child as a patient in the hospital are welcome to use this facility. As I mentioned, McHappy Day does a great job in raising funds for this vital service. I was pleased to see the huge turnout at the McDonalds restaurants that I attended. First stop for the day was the Wadalba McDonalds. What a turnout! I was impressed by the number of people donating to the charity as well as the number of community groups. The most noticeable group was the Wadalba RFS, with their fire truck parked out the front. The brigade had kids lined up to learn about bushfire safety—and also to have a go with the fire hose. The Northlakes Toukley Rotary team was there in numbers and this day provided Rotary with an opportunity to raise funds for their many causes, with raffle tickets sold by the volunteers. As the day progressed, I moved to Wyong McDonalds and met representatives from the Central Coast Girl Guides, who were selling their always popular biscuits. Yet again there was a huge turnout from all walks of life. A number of local businesses turned out to support the day, as well as other sporting and community groups. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point in drawing attention to McHappy Day in my electorate is to demonstrate how beneficial an organisation like McDonalds is to our community. On McHappy Day I was able to spend some time with Raylee McLeod, who is licensee of multiple McDonalds restaurants across the Central Coast. Raylee employs approximately 1,000 young people across the region, some as young as 14 years of age. An area of significance for me in my role as a member of parliament is the ongoing encouragement of our young people to engage in the workforce. Here we have an example of a local business owner employing hundreds of young people, ensuring that they have a taste of working life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Dobell, there are approximately 10,000 young people aged 14 to 18 years. I am sure that most of them would greatly benefit from part-time employment while they are still at school. While commending Raylee for everything she does youth employment in our community, she provided me with the following quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Employing people from the age of 14 and a half to 50 years of age means we have a diverse workforce. Employees with a disability, others with difficult home lives all play an integral role in the success of our business. Flexibility in employing young people on varied school and extra-curricular activities has meant we can employ more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effort undertaken by the community on McHappy day is just the tip of the iceberg when we look at how much people like Raylee and her team do for the young people in our community. I would like to thank all those volunteers across organisations involved in McHappy and especially thank Raylee and her team.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  This week is Dyslexia Empowerment Week, and, last weekend on Sunday, I joined my state parliamentary colleague Maree Edwards in Bendigo at the beginning of Dyslexia Empowerment Week, our BOLD walk. The walk was organised by BOLD to bring people together to share stories about what it means to have dyslexia, to talk about support services but, more importantly, to raise awareness of what it means to live with dyslexia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dyslexia is still an area of the unknown. We do not yet have the research or the science to tell us why it is that people with dyslexia struggle. We do not know why it is that somebody with dyslexia may be thinking of the word 'cat' and saying the word 'cat' but then write the word 'dog'. We know that it is something to do with the brain, but we have not yet had the research or the dollars to unpack what is going on. So this week, being Dyslexia Empowerment Week, we call on the government to do more to help people with dyslexia—to fund the research so that we can properly find out what is going on. This research will then help inform education. For dyslexic people to get ahead and have the same opportunities to achieve as any other Australian, resourcing for schools is critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dyslexics are well known. People have spoken up about overcoming this disorder and going on to do great things. Albert Einstein is quite often referred to as a famous dyslexic. Richard Branson and Tom Cruise are quite often referred to as famous dyslexics. They are people who have dyslexia who have made it in life and are willing to speak out about their early challenges in life. We know that for a lot of people with dyslexia what makes the difference is education in those early years. Quite a lot of people with dyslexia will tell you that they do not quite remember when they learnt to read; it just happened. That is where our schools need the resources. That is why, in Dyslexia Empowerment Week, I call on this government to restore the funding to our schools, and put the money back in through the Gonski package to ensure that our schools have the resources and the teacher aides that they need to help all students with dyslexia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disorder that can be overcome with the right resourcing and support in the early years and throughout their lives. We can have the next community leaders—the next Tom Cruises, Richard Bransons and Albert Einsteins—if this government gets serious about funding and support for schools and about making sure that every school, regardless of post code, has the resources that they need. Dyslexia Empowerment Week is a chance for all of us to remember the importance of proper school funding and making sure every school has the resources that they need to help students with dyslexia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMPKINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  Today, I will speak about the issue of grandparents raising their grandchildren. This is not the first time that I have spoken about the issue and the circumstances of grandparents in this situation, but last week I met with Sue Baile of Wanslea, and we spoke about it. Wanslea provide services to families and children, and they have a program called Grandcare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an unfortunate fact that in Cowan—and in fact everywhere around the country—for a range of reasons many grandparents are now the full-time carers of their grandchildren. The reasons may be that the grandchildren have been orphaned, but the reason I hear of most is drugs. The parents are no longer capable or sadly, in many cases, willing to fulfil their responsibilities as parents. When Sue and I spoke about this, she told me that it is common in Western Australia for the grandparents to contact the Department for Child Protection if they are concerned about the safety and welfare of their grandchildren. What then happens is that the priority for action by DCP is immediate danger. Grandparents are obviously very sensitive to the increasing impact on their grandchildren of the neglect that comes from a home ravaged by the scourge of illicit drugs, whereas DCP's priorities are about life-threatening danger and, of course, the evil of sexual abuse. This then means that grandparents are likely to intervene themselves by taking their grandchildren rather than waiting for DCP to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the grandparent or grandparents take the grandchildren, DCP does not prioritise them, as the grandchildren are not in the situation of concern anymore. It means that they are not officially made foster parents and cannot get the same foster parent payments that official foster parents receive via DCP. As Sue Baile told me, it is also the case that often the family tax benefits for the child remain with the parents rather than going with the child to the grandparent looking after the child. I am told that the reason for this is that in some cases the grandparents do not want to risk full estrangement from their own children. In some communities, there is also a risk that asking Centrelink for the FTB will make the parents violent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a difficult situation for grandparents in a financial sense—significantly greater and unplanned costs, but with no or little government support. Grandparents in this situation are at risk of some social isolation from their peers. For most grandparents, the visiting of the grandchildren is not a seven-day-a-week experience. Sue told me that grandparents permanently looking after their grandchildren are not included by their peers as much in social occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After my meeting with Sue, I immediately wrote to the state minister, Helen Morton, and acknowledged that the state government has instituted the Grandparent Support Scheme, which offers the opportunity for grandparents to be recognised as being a full-time carer and to receive a payment. This is good news. But it does seem that if they are full-time carers then they are the foster parents too and should receive the fortnightly foster parent payment. It would also then be appropriate that the person recognised as the foster parent should receive the family tax benefits for the children or child that they are looking after. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my view that there is a need for state-federal coordination to ensure that recognition as the grandparent at the state level will result in the obligatory transfer of the FTB to the grandparent. This will go some way to assist grandparents in the challenges that this role currently presents to them.</span>

These attacks appear to have much of the same unpredictable nature as the jihadi attacks in Australia, but they are also fuelled by the deliberate incitement of Palestinian leaders such as Mahmoud Abbas, who claims that Israel wants to change the status of the Temple Mount.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just like the kind of irresponsible statements made by some imams here to young jihadis trying to kill Australian police or civilians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, rightly condemned these words. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No amount of frustration is appropriate to license any violence anywhere at any time. No violence should occur. And the Palestinians need to understand … President Abbas … needs to be condemning this, loudly and clearly …. And he needs to not engage in some of the incitement that his voice has sometimes been heard to encourage. …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Member for Deakin pointed out, there has been example after example of imams in televised sermons brandishing knives and instructing Palestinians to 'form stabbing squads and cut them into body parts'. But I, and many people around Australia, have been particularly upset by comments from the member for Fremantle, who has stood up in this parliament and blamed the victim. In what kind of moral universe is it legitimate, understandable or okay to knife and stab innocent civilians, run them over with cars or shoot them in bus stations? It is not okay in Israel. It is not okay here in Australia. In what moral universe should we say that the media should pay more attention to the people with knives in their hands than the people with knives in their chests?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For most Australians, who do not live in such a morally inverted universe, let me cite the words of the Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews, at a business function last week. 'I won't have a bar of this notion,' he said. 'If a Jewish mother or father is randomly attacked in the street, then, so long as you go back far enough time or you cast the net wide enough or you draw the bow long enough, it can somehow be the victim's fault. It can somehow be Israel's fault. I won't have any of that.' That is what the Victorian Premier said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Underlying the existential bigotry that motivates these jihadists is the fact that the attacks have taken place not just in Jerusalem but all over Israel where there is no controversy of occupation—in shopping malls in Ra'anana, Kiryat Gat and Petah Tikva and in the bus stations of Beersheba and Afula.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude by saying that anyone who makes these kinds of moral-equivalence statements will be held to account for them, particularly if, God forbid, these kinds of jihadist attacks continue in Australia. God forbid that there should be a similar incident in Perth or Fremantle. You cannot say in the Australian parliament that it is okay for people to make a moral equivalence between people who are stabbing innocent civilians in Kiryat Gat, Jerusalem, Afula or wherever and then try to hide your sentiments in Australia. I am sure the Western Australian media and people all over this country will find those kinds of double standards and hypocrisy intolerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the people of Melbourne Ports, my constituents, I share the horror that people in Australia are expressing over these stabbing attacks on innocent civilians. We face a worldwide problem. We were with the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung last night trying to understand how all of us all over the world are going to deal with the problem of deluded young people who are in their rooms with the internet and who are being fanaticised by these dreadful people in Daesh all around the world. The problems that they face in Israel are the same problems we face here in Australia, in Germany, in the United States and all over the world. The civilised world has to act together against these people.</span>

It was at Isurava in 1942 that the Australian troops faced the Japanese imperial force in a brutal campaign where many Australians, Japanese and Papuans lost their lives. It was on 24 August that Private Bruce Kingsbury courageously sacrificed his own life in the defence of his mates and the protection of our nation. Private Kingsbury was in fact our first serviceman to receive the Victoria Cross in an Australian territory, a true hero and a custodian of the Anzac spirit but quite simply a man—a man who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of our country and for the peace we now all enjoy.</span>

However, my trip to Kokoda in September was as a part of and a participant in the young women's youth leadership program brought together by Panthers on the Prowl to teach those four pillars of courage, mateship, sacrifice and endurance to six young women in my electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Whilst other countries and global business leaders step up their efforts to combat climate change, Australia continues to dither. That Australia does so under the leadership of the current Prime Minister, who previously proclaimed strong belief in the science of climate change, is deeply disappointing—even more so when the most recent climate science data from around the world confirms that the climate is changing and that human activity is a critical cause. CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions are now above 400 parts per million compared with 280 parts per million in the pre-industrial era and the 350 parts per million considered to be a safe level. Of greater concern is that, if the world does not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span>, climate scientists tell us we are heading towards catastrophic consequences in some parts of the world. Sadly, leaders who deny the risks will be long gone and will not have to account for their failure to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's new emissions reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 is inadequate when compared with the equivalent US target of 41 per cent, the German target of 46 per cent and the UK target of 48 per cent. The international criticism is that Australia, as the 13th largest emitter of greenhouse gases and per capita one of the highest in the world, is not making its fair contribution towards meeting global targets. Whilst the Australian government bickers with other countries about who is responsible and what action each of them should take, the most vulnerable people of the world and future generations, who today have no voice, pay the highest price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note a report on 'peers and partners' highlighting that Australia is not doing as much as its major trading partners and allies in dealing with climate change. In particular, Australia is lagging behind in energy efficiency and carbon pricing. The Turnbull government's climate change response is centred around a $2.5 billion Emissions Reduction Fund, which pays big business to reduce emissions, and the $700 million Green Army program. Compare that with what other countries are doing. China, the world's largest emitter and Australia's largest trading partner, has pledged to peak its emissions in the year 2030 and to cut CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. In 2013, China generated 29 tonnes more renewable energy than Australia. By 2016, Beijing City will close all of its coal-fired power stations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UK, led by a conservative government and with current emissions levels similar to those of Australia, has binding targets to cut emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050 on 1990 levels. The UK also has legally binding five-year carbon budgets that set a cap on emissions in addition to being part of the European Union's emissions trading scheme. The UK does not subsidise fossil fuel companies, and has a renewable energy program and an energy efficiency program in place. South Korea, also a conservative-led nation, has a suite of measures in place, which include an emissions reduction target of 37 per cent by 2030. In January this year, South Korea commenced its emissions trading scheme, which accounts for 65 per cent of national emissions. It also is progressively replacing coal power with nuclear and gas. The USA, in addition to its emissions reduction target, recently released a clean power plan to reduce emissions from power plants by 32 per cent by 2030. Many US states have their own renewable energy targets, energy efficiency targets and building energy codes. California, with a larger economy and population than Australia, began an ETS in 2012, and last month California's parliament passed a law requiring utilities to purchase at least 50 per cent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, not all governments or people of influence are in denial about climate change or believe that it is someone else's problem. I was therefore encouraged to see the number of global entities that partially or completed divested themselves of shares in sectors which add to global carbon emissions. According to a report from Arabella Advisors, to date 436 institutions and 2,040 individuals across 43 countries and representing $2.6 trillion in assets have committed to divest from fossil fuel companies. This week in the US 81 companies, including Walmart, Intel and Hershey's, with a combined market value of assets worth $5 trillion, met with President Obama and pledged support for drastic action on climate change at the Paris conference.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is not just an environmental challenge but equally an economic and social challenge. The next global conference on climate change will be held in Paris next month, and at that conference Australia will be judged by the international community. I urge the Australian government to do what is right and at the Paris conference commit to meaningful climate change policy instead of succumbing to popular domestic politics and vested interests. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="TK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SOUTHCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  Last month I led the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on a committee visit to Fiji and New Zealand. While the committee will produce a report of this trip, I want to speak about New Zealand's approach to public sector management, which I think we can benefit from in Australia. For most people, public sector management is not a particularly interesting topic, and promising better public services is something it seems every government does, which I am sure that most people routinely view with scepticism. However, I was extremely impressed by the reform agenda that New Zealand is pursuing in its public sector, and it was very clear that they are managing things much better and more efficiently than we are in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four separate areas I would like to focus on. The first is better public services. In 2012, the New Zealand government set 10 challenging goals for its public services: (1) reducing long-term welfare dependence; (2) increasing participation in early childhood education; (3) increasing infant immunisation and reducing the incidence of rheumatic fever; (4) reducing the number of children experiencing physical abuse; (5) and (6) increasing the proportion of young adults with specific minimum education qualifications; (7) reducing the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime; (8) reducing the re-offending rate; (9) reducing the cost to business from dealing with the government; and (10) moving more of the public's transactions with government on-line in a digital environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing about these goals is they are not just aspirational, and they are not easy to achieve. The government and agency chief executives are jointly accountable for achieving results. Metrics for each are regularly published and publicly available, and everyone can see whether the outcomes are on track or need attention. This is a simple reform, but it has a clarity and a sense of purpose. Many of these goals stretch across multiple government agencies, and there is a strong focus on creating a culture where state services leaders take ownership of the reforms, focus on building customer-focused agencies and collaborate across agency boundaries. The result has been what the State Services Commission of New Zealand, which plays a key role in delivering these results, has called the New Zealand public sector's 'biggest transformation in a generation'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second major reform, which supports the first, is the Performance Improvement Framework. Known colloquially in New Zealand and pronounced as 'the pif', the original idea came from the capability reviews in the UK but has been improved on by New Zealand so that the PIF is forward looking and involves continuous improvement. It is a review of the agencies' fitness for purpose today and for the future, looking at the current state of an agency, how well-placed it is to deal with the issues that confront it in the medium-term future and the areas where the agency needs to make improvements. We found there was widespread support for the PIF process in the New Zealand parliament, from agency heads and from private sector firms involved in public sector governance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third major reform I would like to draw to the attention of the House is the way they use data in New Zealand. Statistics New Zealand is working to integrate different data sources to form insights the government needs to improve social and economic outcomes. For example, the Ministry of Education is already developing population projections, building consent data and school enrolment data to work out where new schools would go. By using geospatial population and traffic information, it is possible to work out the best place for a school or hospital so it will be of most benefit to the community as well as cut travel time to get to those places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware that both the New South Wales government and the Victorian government have looked very closely at a number of these public sector reforms in New Zealand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New Zealand approach is very different from the one in the Australian Public Service. New Zealand has moved away from a rules based approach to a principle and results based approach. I think that is a better approach and I think it is something that we should do in Australia. I encourage members of parliament with an interest in better public services to look at the experience in New Zealand. In my view, they do it much better than we do and we could learn a lot from those three reforms.</span>

Khin Khin Kyaw, a lawyer representing nearly 60 students detained after protests, was summoned to court for obstructing authorities after signing a petition calling for the activists' release. Phyo Wai Kyaw, a solo protester protesting the use of bribery in the judicial system, was also sentenced under section 18 of the artfully named Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act. Despite claims of a shift towards democracy in Myanmar, these incidents all occurred just in the last month. Campaigning is currently underway for Myanmar's general election, which will be held on 8 November. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week I met with a group of Burmese residents who live in my electorate of Hotham. They told me stories of friends and family who have been targeted for their political views and of their longing to be able to return to their birthplace and see a fully formed democracy there. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under complex practices, the polls that are to take place will elect Myanmar's national and local parliaments. Whilst voting is in November, it will not be until the meeting of both parties of parliament and a meeting of military officials 90 days later that we will discover who the new president of Myanmar is. These polls have been described by Burmese officials as the first open general elections in 25 years. Senior military officials have publicly committed to respecting the results of the election, and the country's military controlled electoral body, the Union Election Commission, have implemented some reforms towards improving the transparency and the veracity of polls. But these changes do not go far enough. Constitutional and procedural barriers continue to prevent free and fair elections in Myanmar, and the lingering military presence around all of these proceedings puts a chill on freedom of expression for those that wish to become politically engaged.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 96 political prisoners who remain in Myanmar's jails and a further 466 activists who today await trial, according to the Association for Political Prisoners. The military continue to retain a quarter of all the parliamentary seats in Myanmar, meaning that any challenging party has to control two-thirds of the remaining seats in order to carry any laws in that parliament. Key ministers, such as for defence, continue to be selected by the head of the army, not the President of Myanmar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know that Aung San Suu Kyi has been fighting for decades for a more peaceful democratic process in Myanmar. Today she is the leader of Myanmar's opposition party but is prevented from running for President under constitutional changes which prevent candidates from running if they have foreign spouses or children. Despite protests, there do not seem to be any indications that this incredibly unfair and arbitrary policy will be changed. The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law described Myanmar's constitution as the most entrenched and most difficult of any in the world to change. We know that Ms San Suu Kyi's party would need to win more than two-thirds of the remaining seats to form a majority government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention something about the millions of Burmese who live today outside of Burma. Many of them have settled in Australia but also in Singapore, in Hong Kong and in other parts of Asia. Today the right to vote of even those that remain Burmese citizens is being significantly curtailed. Burmese Australians who are living here at the moment can only vote at the embassy in Canberra, when most of these residents are located in Sydney and in Melbourne. What we have heard from the Burmese community locally is that there has been a lack of clarity about how exactly they go about voting. They do not know when they need to be at the embassy to lodge their vote. This is preventing many Burmese who are living around the world from having their say in the democratic process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Myanmar itself, there are further concerns about how the election itself will be conducted. The Burmese community in Australia told me about significant and well-founded fears they have that votes will be tampered with and that the distribution of ballot papers will not be done fairly. It is another issue within their democratic process that at this stage there is no clear and transparent way for resolving electoral fraud—just another in a long list of things that I would like the Myanmar government to consider as it goes through its democratisation process.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Australians love sport and they certainly love cheering on a team that kicks goals. Playing sport, being a part of a team and working together are what has helped build this great nation. Almost every child grows up playing one form of sport such as netball, rugby, tennis, swimming and so forth. Undoubtedly, it has been a great Aussie tradition for a long time to enjoy a weekend footy match with the family, cheering on your favourite team. I know that our love for sport is shared by many of my colleagues and those on both sides of the House, because it is such a huge part of our national identity. Traditionally, when we talk about football in Australia, we are referring to an oblong-shaped ball that you attempt to score a try with—fellow New South Welshmen and Welshwomen can relate—or attempting to kick an oblong-shaped ball while running if you are from those states that swear by AFL. Nonetheless, our version of footy is what has sustained us for generations and is firmly entrenched in our national identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, the other form of football—more commonly known as soccer on our shores and always referred to as football outside of Australia—is the largest participation sport in Australia. In my electorate of Barton, football or soccer is a key favourite for families. Aspiring young athletes and community soccer clubs regularly hold training sessions and games at one of several parks or ovals in the St George region. Nationally, there are over 1.96 million people, both men and women, who participate in football. Over half a million are registered participants, and 46,000 are in South Sydney alone. This should provide a clear picture of just what kind of an audience football generates in Australia. It may not have the same recognition that NRL, AFL or rugby union do, but it definitely elicits an equally passionate response from many of its fans. This, coupled with the enormous success our Socceroos have garnered, has fuelled the demand for more football- or soccer-related entertainment within close reach of Barton residents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a precedent for all levels of government to support current and future sporting developments, given the obvious health benefits that sports like football produce. The federal government in June this year announced its $100 million Sporting Schools program, making it Australia's largest school based participation initiative for children. We do this because we want children to have a great hobby and engage in activities that keep them healthy. This program was partnered up with the Football Federation of Australia, because it is an organisation that offers terrific opportunities for children of all ages and physical abilities. The FFA provides excellent programs for aspiring young athletes to take their skills to the next level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the great pleasure of meeting with Football Federation Australia several times to discuss what opportunities exist for football in my electorate of Barton. As I mentioned earlier, Barton has a great number of soccer players, whether budding professionals or amateurs, and they appreciate the opportunity to have access to bigger and better sporting fields. Whilst other major sports like netball, NRL and AFL have received tremendous support from state and federal counterparts to build or rebuild infrastructure, the FFA is equally deserving of assistance. Football Federation Australia has come a long way in the development of high-performing international teams and the founding of the A-League. It will experience even more growth in the next 20 years, given its current trajectory of the participation base, the association's accessibility and its global outlook. The father of football in Australia, Johnny Warren, is an icon of the St George community. He played in Australia's first-ever World Cup game in 1974 and received FIFA's highest award, the Order of Merit, in 2003. These are just some of the reasons why the FFA should have Jubilee Oval and Barton Park as its permanent home in the heart of the Barton electorate. In particular, the A-League would be a great asset to South Sydney, where it has an incredible amount of support. For this to happen the FFA needs state-of-the-art training facilities and a stadium that can service the whole of South Sydney. This site would have national recognition as the home of football, with the capacity for a large volume of visitors. This would put South Sydney on the map, and deservedly so. For a long time Barton was that forgotten, in-between area nestled between the airport and some coastline, sometimes lumped in accidentally with the shire. Barton is in fact a high-growth area with fantastic infrastructure in place to support local visitors and the many young families who choose to raise their children here. It would be wonderful to have such a nationally recognised association use Jubilee Oval for games and training, which would attract immense local support. The additional Barton Park, currently underutilised, has the capacity to be a training facility for an A-League team as well as host elite youth tournaments and support the many local clubs who are in need of extra fields and turf. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I rise today to share with the chamber some of the stories of people who will be affected if this government gets its way and its wish to cut penalty rates. We know they are going after penalty rates. Whether it be a backbencher, the Prime Minister or a minister, they have not kept it a secret that they are opposed to penalty rates, particularly on a Sunday. They have taken the side of the employers and not listened to the stories of the people who will be affected if penalty rates are cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share with the House the stories of three people who have spoken to the Labor created Fair Work Taskforce. We created this task force to speak directly with workers about the impact of government proposals, particularly in the space of IR. As we know, the Productivity Commission has put forward a proposal to cut the Sunday penalty rates. We were quite fortunate to have one of the Productivity Commission's hearings in Bendigo, and what struck me when I was listening to the conversations, to the evidence that was being presented, and also to the questioning by the productivity commissioner was the lack of understanding about the rates of pay that people on penalty rates are earning. The commissioner kept talking about 200 per cent versus 150 per cent but did not take into account the base rate. If you have a low base rate 200 per cent is not a lot. If you have a higher base rate 150 per cent of that may in fact be more than somebody on 200 per cent is earning. That is what was being discussed in Bendigo, that is what is being discussed throughout the Productivity Commission hearings and that is also what is being raised in Labor's Fair Work Taskforce. What we learned about from these three stories was the impact, what would happen if the government did indeed proceed with the proposal that is before the Productivity Commission to cut the Sunday penalty rates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the people we spoke to was a woman of 45 who is a retail worker. She opposes the cuts to weekend penalty rates. She has worked as a part-time shop assistant in a large supermarket for nine years. She is a single mum with three children aged 10, 19 and 21, who all live at home. She says, 'Without the additional income from penalty rates, I would not be able to meet my mortgage repayments, pay my rates and keep the roof over my family's head.' She is doing what we ask of her. She is working part-time and raising three children on her own. Yet, if this government were to proceed with cutting penalty rates, she would struggle to keep the roof over her children<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s heads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the Sunday penalty rates worth to this person? She says, 'If my Sunday penalty rate was cut it would be a pay cut of about $5.35 an hour, which equates to just over $1,000 in wages a year.' It may sound like a lot when you say 200 per cent, but when you start to talk about what that cut means hourly and then annually, it is $1,000—and that $1,000 makes a big the difference to this family. It is the difference between them paying their rates and mortgage and having to find somewhere else to live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is of a person aged 29, who is also a retail worker. Since the age of 15, he has worked in the fast food and retail industries. He is employed under an enterprise agreement. He is currently paid $31 an hour and $79 for working on Sundays. He normally works a Sunday shift. If penalty rates were cut, he would lose about $5 an hour, and that equates to $1,526 per year. Again, if this particular young worker lost that money, he would struggle to pay his bills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talk a lot of talk when it comes to penalty rates, but I do not think they understand the real impact. Sure, our shops are now open seven days a week, but I note that the government are only talking about the Sunday rate. They are not talking about the Monday rate. If the government were serious about supporting enterprise bargaining, they would be encouraging employers to increase the Monday to Friday rate, but they are not. They are only talking about the Sunday rate. If we really want to see people progress then we should get behind the enterprise bargaining scheme that we have and get behind people who are collectively bargaining with their employers for better outcomes. A cut to just the Sunday penalty rate will push a whole bunch of working people, like the people I have mentioned today, into poverty—and that is not acceptable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I want to outline some important green army projects that are underway in my electorate of Capricornia, in particular Mackay, Rockhampton and the Capricorn Coast. The green army provides environmental and conservation training and skills to young locals in the region aged between 17 and 24 to equip them with new skills in an effort to obtain full-time employment. The program is set to become the largest of its type in Australia, building to 15,000 young Australians by 2018. It is evidence of our coalition government delivering on our commitment to provide meaningful experience to unemployed young people in Capricornia, who get paid while they contribute to community projects that we all benefit from. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to report to the House on three such projects which are being run in conjunction with the Rockhampton Regional Council, the Mackay Regional Council and Livingstone Shire Council. Firstly, in the Livingstone shire an eight-strong green army team has been praised for their work in fixing key tourist attractions along the Capricorn Coast. Tourists and locals will notice a massive change in the environmental surrounds at the Causeway Lake—one of Livingstone shire<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s most popular picnic and fishing spots, not far from Yeppoon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The team, which will soon move to a new project at Emu Park, includes Zac King, Ethan Ratcliffe-Turner, Harley King-Hall, Tarcisio Rossi, Steven Johns, Daniel Friswell and Samantha Bartle. The team is supervised by Max Bundesen from Conservation Volunteers Australia. They work 30 hours a week and get paid while they train. Recently, I visited the team with Livingstone Mayor Bill Ludwig. I congratulate the council for participating in the program. While at the Causeway, the green army team has constructed 250 white bollards along the lake foreshore and replanted native plants and ground cover and has been involved in a host of other activities in restoring and protecting the areas natural habitat. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, another eight-strong team of Green Army participants will soon be chosen to begin work to rehabilitate Mount Archer, following damage from bushfires and Cyclone Marcia. Mount Archer is a major landmark, a national park and a hub for community recreation that towers above the city of Rockhampton. The Mount Archer project has been approved by the federal government under a special round to help communities recovering from recent natural disasters. The six-month conservation project is being supervised by the Rockhampton Regional Council. Rockhampton Regional Council has recently approved a master plan with a grand vision to restore Mount Archer to a prominent icon of Rockhampton, with a range of pursuits from bushwalking to extreme mountain sports. The idea is that when visitors come to experience the city, 'You haven't done Rockhampton until you've done Mount Archer'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Mayor Margaret Strelow, Councillor Neil Fisher, committee chair Cherie Rutherford and all council for embracing the Green Army and for their vision, which aims to provide Rockhampton with an icon that will become the city's key tourism and recreational identity. I look forward to working with the council in the future on further ways the federal government can help support their plan. Mount Archer is one of Rockhampton's hidden jewels, but recently it has seen the brunt of Mother Nature in the form of bushfires, landslides and a cyclone. Councillor Neil Fisher suggested that, now, with the help of the Green Army is the perfect time to see the rebirth of this area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A third Green Army project is soon to get underway in Capricornia, the Mackay riparian restoration project. This will help restore vegetation along the local river system. The program, supervised by Conservation Volunteers Australia, is being overseen by Mackay Regional Council. I congratulate Mackay Mayor Deirdre Comerford and her council for signing up to the third stage of the project. Mayor Comerford is a tremendous and passionate leader in the Mackay region and a Green Army supporter. This project will ensure greater environmental sustainability and will enhance natural ecosystems, repair and prevent erosion and increase biodiversity in this part of Mackay. Young locals interested in joining the Green Army can register their interest in participating at @environment.gov.au.</span>

I remind members opposite and, indeed, the ministers in the new government, the Abbott-Turnbull government. Page 65 of <span style="font-style:italic;">House of Representatives Practice</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>talks about examples of ministerial resignation. One of those examples is:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on Tuesday there was a long article where the plotters within the government insisted on bragging to journalists, and I would imagine this caused great consternation in the Liberal Party party room.

I have gone on about this before and, in case the members opposite do not think I have not applied the same rules to my own party, I remonstrated about this in the first caucus meeting after the election in 2010. Laurie Oakes wrote an article about it; you are free to read it if you like. So I am not applying this rule selectively. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ministers have an obligation to be up-front with the Prime Minister about their intentions and their loyalty. If they are not, they are in breach of the Westminster tradition, and they are in breach of cabinet government. This article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, and there are a number of quotes in there of concern, states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A vague campaign committee for Turnbull began to take shape. There was no chairman except for Turnbull himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the then communications minister was in charge of a vague committee—that is, a cabal, a conspiracy—within the government to depose the Prime Minister. We then have:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Julie Bishop had been aware of the rumblings for weeks, having been approached by colleagues seeking out her disposition to a change on and off since February. But Turnbull was always counting numbers. She would not go to Abbott with every rumour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is in knowledge of a conspiracy, in a cabal within the government, and not going to the Prime Minister and informing him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralIInterjecting">An honourable member interjecting</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HW9" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHAMPION:</span>
                  </a>  I talked about that. You want to shut up—walking into the room half-cocked. You want to think about it, mate. We then have Michaelia Cash, who is in the outer ministry. Apparently, she had been an Abbott supporter but:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… had come to believe that the PMO had become a locus of dysfunction infecting the entire government. Cash brought credibility to the argument that sections of the Right in the party were seriously on the move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a minister in the outer ministry who had supported the Prime Minister but suddenly does not—and neglects to inform the Prime Minister. That is your obligation, under the practice. That is your obligation as a minister and it is a serious obligation. You are supposed to go to the Prime Minister and say: 'I do not support you anymore. I am resigning.' Then you come into this parliament and tell people. That is the Westminster democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Malcolm Fraser did it when he was a minister in the Gorton government and so did Andrew Peacock. So there are some recent examples in this country, and there are numerous examples in the United Kingdom. This is a serious problem, for the country, because it undermines cabinet government. How can any Prime Minister do anything? How can they be assured of anything if the cabinet is not up-front with them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We go on from the Michaelia Cash to the member for Bradfield, Paul Fletcher, the parliamentary secretary to Turnbull. He was involved in this, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. I do not mind being corrected. If it is people on the backbench, fair enough, but if people are in ministerial office this is a very serious problem. They are supposed to go to the Prime Minister. On and on it goes. The member for Sturt had a meeting with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister walked away from that meeting, in The Adelaide Club, thinking he had the member for Sturt's support. A very important figure, the member for Sturt, in the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are serious problems. This is a serious issue. We should be talking about it, because it is of vital importance to the way we govern this country. I have been concerned about it in my own party, in the past, and I talked about, in my own party, in the past. We fixed our rules so that it could never happen again. But those opposite need to think, clearly, about this. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  This is the second time, recently, I have followed the member for Wakefield in this chamber. I know he was sincere when he spoke about his side of politics but he forgot to mention that no-one in that media report was calling themselves Dasher and speaking in the third person or doing video retakes to show how they had been involved in that situation. He should have expanded on his own side's downfall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to update the House on the constituents of Swan about the NBN following the release of the proposed rollouts. The completion of the National Broadband Network in the electorate of Swan is on the horizon following the inclusion of all remaining suburbs in the much-anticipated three-year rollout plan released on Friday. My electorate of Swan is already the most advanced in Western Australia, in terms of the rollout. I know that might disappoint you, Madam Deputy Speaker Price, being another West Australian electorate holder. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now on track to become one of the first WA electorates to be completed. The dates for the remainder of the rollouts, in the electorate of Swan, are: Como, 2,500 houses in the second half of 2016; Beckenham, Bentley, Cannington, East Cannington, Karawara, Queens Park, Saint James, Waterford, Welshpool and Wilson had 16,400 houses in November 2015. Where we cross the border with Tangney we have: Ferndale, Lynwood, Riverton, Parkwood, Rossmoyne, Shelley and Willeton, which will be 3,100 houses in the second half of 2017. In Ascot, Belmont, Cloverdale, Kewdale, the remainder, and Perth Airport, Redcliffe and the remainder of Rivervale, it will be 14,300 houses for the first quarter of 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The progress of the NBN under the coalition government since the 2013 election has been rapid, particularly in my electorate. Just two years ago, at the time of the 2013 election, there were only 34 brownfield premises connected across the whole of Perth and only 75 connected for the whole state of Western Australia actually connected. There were more announcements leading up to the 2013 election from those on the opposite side than there were actual connections. In my electorate alone, Labor came and announced the NBN is being switched on about 20 times and there were not even 20 connections in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, I asked the then communications minister how the rollout in Western Australia was going, particularly in Victoria Park. The honourable member said in October 2011 that the then government announced construction had commenced in East Victoria Park. The Labor government had announced in 2011 it had started and two years later there were no ready-for-service premises in that area. Indeed, despite barrels of propaganda, reams of leaflets and flyers and lots of claims on election day, in total there were 34 brownfield premises in Perth. The NBN connections in Western Australia, he said, have been as rare sightings of Brian Burke—and he was correct on that as well. The situation was bleak with the WA rollout facing a series of severe issues. The lead contractor, Syntheo, pulled out of the state. The minister said at the time work had basically stopped in WA and the rollout was in chaos under the previous government. There were many subcontractors to Syntheo who never got paid under the previous government and it was just an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in the electorate of Swan, after two years of coalition government, we have 28,650 premises ready-for-service across a dozen suburbs, 10,475 of them have actually been activated and, on the ground, build is underway across 14 suburbs. I remind the member for Wakefield there were only 14 connections in my electorate at the last election. Now there are over 10,000 so it is a bit of a comparison. The fact that we are now looking at the NBN's completion in Swan with the inclusion of all the remaining areas in the three-year plan is a remarkable turnaround. The advantages Swan will have by being one of the first electorates to be completed will be significant and shared by businesses as well as residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am looking forward particularly to the work starting on the notorious Ascot exchange, which was promised by the previous government to be fixed in 2009. It still has not been touched but we are working on it, getting it underway because the previous government left the NBN rollout in Western Australia and in my electorate of Swan in a shambles.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I would like to congratulate the newly formed Amnesty International Australia Water Gardens group. This is a group of local constituents who have come together to form a local chapter of Amnesty International in my electorate. They meet on a monthly basis to discuss and promote human rights issues. Their meetings are held at the Sydenham library and they are building solid networks in our local community. There are 700 international Amnesty International supporters in my electorate and the aim of the group is to increase that number. Recently they had a stall at the Brimbank City Council's asylum seeker expo as part of their campaign to raise awareness in the local community about important human rights violations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great pleasure of meeting Meni and Krish, who are from the local Amnesty International chapter in Water Gardens. They came to see me as the federal member of order to draw my attention to Amnesty International's new report on Indigenous youth justice titled <span style="font-style:italic;">A brighter tomorrow: keeping Indigenous kids in the community and out of detention in Australia.</span> This report is the result of extensive research undertaken by Amnesty International between 2013 in 2015 and it makes practical recommendations for the federal, state and territory governments to consider ways in which to reduce their overrepresentation of Indigenous young people in the criminal justice system in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most concerning aspect of this report is that it tells us Indigenous young people are now locked up at 26 times the rate of non-Indigenous young people despite the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island youth account for only just five per cent of the Australian population in detention of 10 to 17-year-olds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These statistics in relation to the incarceration of Indigenous youth should concern us all. It certainly concerns the members of my local Amnesty International group, who care deeply about this issue. They believe that all children deserve a fair start in life. Their message to me and to this parliament is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… kids have healthy happy childhoods when they live in loving and nurturing communities. We believe that disadvantaged kids should be supported to rise above their circumstances and this is not achieved by current government policies of separating them from their communities and locking them up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the main recommendations of this report is that government adopts a justice reinvestment approach in order to address underlying issues that Aboriginal youth face today. My local Amnesty group strongly supports initiatives such as the New South Wales town of Bourke's Maranguka Justice Reinvestment Project initiative, which came to fruition in 2013 when a local Aboriginal leaders and young people, and community members, organisations, local agencies and government representatives came together to develop programs that helped to keep Indigenous young people out of custody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This community-led approach to solving problems is widely regarded as a better approach, and the case for change will be made to the New South Wales government shortly. My local Amnesty group want this parliament to understand—and again, I quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… such initiatives have enormous potential to reduce the numbers of incarcerated indigenous children, create safer communities and reduce government expenditure on juvenile detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 16 recommendations in this report in total, amongst them being the recommendation to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 years to 12 years of age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate there is already an overrepresentation of young people in the juvenile justice system. They are not necessarily Indigenous youth; there are also South Pacific Islanders and some from the Middle East. But the challenges and concerns that our community has for our local youth are similar to the ones we share in common with the community of Bourke. I believe that we can all learn from each other and that whilst there may be some differences, essentially we all share the same belief that caring and stable families and communities form the best environment for the healthy development of young people. Ultimately, it is our responsibility as a community to provide the necessary care and support so that our local kids can flourish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the Watergardens group for raising this with me. I look forward to catching up with them in the near future. I will continue to advocate on their behalf. I would also like to refer the House to the recommendations of this report. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  This morning I would like to talk about a most appalling, ill-considered decision by the New South Wales Planning Assessment Commission to approve a concrete-recycling plant at Moorebank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this decision they have simply ignored the facts. They have shown a complete ignorance of the dangers of particulate matter in air pollution. And the format of the decision and the way they have gone about this places real question marks over the credibility and the legitimacy of the New South Wales Planning Assessment Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The basis of my beef is around the complete failure by the proponents of this development to do any assessment or any modelling of what is called PM2.5 particulate matter. This was drawn to the specific attention of the Planning Assessment Commission during the public hearing. The Planning Assessment Commission were made fully aware that the proponent had failed in its duty to model or to do any assessment of this dangerous pollution, and yet they simply closed their eyes and their ears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The place to start in this is that there is a requirement—a statutory requirement—under the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, the EPA, set out under what is called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Approved Methods for </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">modelling and assessment of air pollutants in New South Wales</span>. Clause 3.1 of this assessment guideline says that all sources of air pollution must be identified. All sources! It is not a matter of picking and choosing which ones you think you can get away with and leaving out the harmful ones. All sources must be identified. This is where the failure comes from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particulate matter—a definition—is the microscopic solid and liquid matter suspended in the Earth's atmosphere. It is not one particular chemical substance. Its sources are extremely varied and its classification is by size rather than by substance. There are three main classifications. There is what is known as PM10, which is coarse particulate matter; there is PM2.5, which is fine particulate matter; and there is PM0.1, which is known as ultrafine particulate matter. Each of them are a subset of each other. The academic literature makes it clear that particulate matter is a known source—fine, coarse and ultrafine particulate matter—from concrete recycling. That is beyond doubt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should we be specifically concerned about particulate matter? On 17 October 2003, the International Agency for Research on Cancer announced classified particulate matter is carcinogenic to humans. This is not CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> or something speculative; this is a carcinogen and it is based on sufficient evidence that exposure to it causes lung cancer. That is what we are talking about. Yet it was not modelled. There was no assessment. It is the fine particulate matter that we should be most concerned about. Even the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority have stated that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The particles of most concern are fine particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5). Unlike larger particles, these smaller particles invisible to the naked eye can be breathed deep into the lungs and even pass into the bloodstream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, this was not modelled. This was not assessed. It is a known source. It was drawn to their attention and yet they failed to look at it. This is an absolute disgrace and a complete failure of this New South Wales Planning Assessment Commission. Why, perhaps, did they not want to model it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some standards that are currently being negotiated which recommend that we should have a maximum concentration at eight microns per cubic metre as a standard set nationally. If you have a look at the Liverpool air quality monitoring station for the last 12 months, we are already above eight microns per cubic meter; we are 8.6. So we are substantially above a threshold that we say harms human health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />We have here a concrete recycling plant that will release more of this deadly carcinogenic material into the atmosphere. And we have the New South Wales Planning Commission Assessment closing their eyes and not even looking that there has been a failure to model. This is an absolute disgrace and failure by these people. It is simply not good enough. I am glad that the Liverpool council are appealing this to the environment courts in New South Wales. These people must be held to account for their failure. They cannot sit there and have these highly paid jobs as commissioners on this bench and simply ignore the evidence, when it is a specific form of pollution that is known as a cancer-causing agent, when it is already above World Health Organization standards. This is a disgrace, and I will continue to argue and fight this case. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I would like to draw the House's attention to some very serious conversations that are happening in my community of Newcastle and, indeed, to congratulate those who were involved in organising last night's meeting around people being pushed to the margins in my community and having a focus on the impacts of poverty and inequality for the people in the Newcastle and Hunter region. Some of the issues that are coming out as very strong issues in the community are: the impacts of the gendered pay gap; the casualisation of the workforce; the disparity between men and women's superannuation payments, and access they have to superannuation and the implications that has for women who now, later in life, are leaving violent relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the very pressing issues now for a number of women's services in my electorate of Newcastle is the change in demographics in women who are presenting at those services in order to seek help. I have met on a number of occasions now with NOVA women's services in my electorate of Newcastle. NOVA is a service for women and children. They specialise in trying to provide safe accommodation for women post-separation. They have been bringing to my attention this phenomenon of older women becoming homeless. Last financial year Nova for Women &amp; Children supported 32 women aged between 55 and 85 in crisis accommodation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the stories about women who have left violent relationships are especially tragic. The fortunate ones get away with the car, which subsequently becomes their primary source of accommodation post separation. Can you imagine a community where 55- to 85-year-old women who have left violent relationships are forced to sleep and live in their car? Less than one per cent of private rental market properties are affordable to women who are reduced to living on Newstart, unemployment benefits, having left their relationships. They do not have savings. They do not have a superannuation account to fall back on. This is the situation they are faced with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are community services in my region which are now running secured car park areas. This is a phenomenon we see in the United States, where women who have been rendered homeless and are in extreme financial hardship as a result of the violent relationships they have left have to live in their car, which is their only affordable accommodation option. These women, who have been forced into living on the streets, are at the mercy of church groups who lease out the car parks in their church grounds so that these women can sleep overnight, have access to some toileting and showering facilities and have some sense of security. That is no way to treat older women in our society. It is no way to treat anybody in our society. But the notion that women and their children are reduced to this is especially disturbing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 70 women have died as a result of gender violence in Australia so far this year. On every occasion I have stood in this parliament I have said that this is utterly unacceptable. If we do not want those women to have died in vain, then we really have to take very seriously our commitment to and measures for preventing and putting an end to all forms of gender violence in Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  My region is in need of a new tourist attraction—one that will increase domestic and international visitation, stimulate the local economy and create jobs. Wide Bay Burnett includes Lady Musgrave, Lady Elliot and Fraser islands. The region is renowned for its fresh seafood, perfect climate and awe-inspiring marine life. Yet it has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Tourism operators say they need another water based attraction that will keep their boats in the water during the months that humpback whales and loggerhead turtles are no longer present. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of a military dive wreck was first floated with me before the last federal election by Nicky Schulz. Nick is a very well-respected commercial fisherman from Hervey Bay, who is passionate about protecting and celebrating our marine environment. Not long after being elected to represent the people of Hinkler, I contacted local business owners, recreational scuba divers and my state and council counterparts to gauge their interest in the proposal and was overwhelmed by their positivity. I wrote to Assistant Minister for Defence Darren Chester to seek advice on which military vessels were due to be decommissioned over the next few years. In November last year Mr Chester visited my electorate to see firsthand why Wide Bay Burnett is the ideal location for a dive wreck. Hervey Bay Whale Watch owners Brian and Jill Perry took Mr Chester out on the water and expressed their support for the proposal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A Wide Bay Burnett regional dive wreck advisory committee was formed to assess the project's feasibility. The advisory group includes representatives from the Hervey Bay Boat Club, the Hervey Bay Chamber of Commerce, three locally owned scuba diving and whale watching businesses, the regional development authority and the Department of State Development, as well as the Bundaberg, Fraser Coast and Gympie regional councils. The group also includes experts who have established dive wrecks in other locations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year, the advisory group met with several share-holding ministers in Canberra to outline the details contained in their business case. They are asking the federal government to approve the gifting, stripping and scuttling of the recently decommissioned HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk </span>in 34 metres of water at a site midway between Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. Communities like Burrum Heads would benefit as well. Burrum Heads is soon to get a new boat ramp, which will be ideal for launching dive boats to take the shortest run to the proposed wreck site. The advisory group have held community information sessions, and they have established a Facebook page which has attracted some 730 'likes' in just a few short weeks. I encourage business owners, history buffs, water sport lovers, recreational fishers, tourists and of course locals to support the advisory group, to 'like' their Facebook page and to share it with their friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local media coverage has been overwhelmingly positive, and I expect that that will continue as the advisory group's campaign escalates in coming weeks. The advisory group estimates that a military dive wreck would contribute between $1 million and $4 million each year to the local economy. This will be a great rate of return for a one-off estimated investment of approximately $6 million. It would create additional breeding habitats for local fish stocks and other marine life. An HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>military dive wreck would complement the Rats of Tobruk Memorial in Bundaberg, the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Brisbane</span> dive wreck at Mooloolaba and the Fraser Coast Military Trail, which is currently being developed by the Fraser Coast Regional Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local RSL sub-branches are very supportive of the project. Hinkler has a larger than average veteran population and an impressive ADF recruitment application rate, but it receives the lowest annual Defence spend of any federal electorate in the country. I have met with Attorney-General George Brandis in regard to the project and to discuss any potential legal impediments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before it can formally seek funding for the project, the advisory group needs a clearer picture of the remediation work that will need to be done to enable the vessel to be scuttled. The advisory group is seeking approval for McMahon Services to board HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk </span>at Garden Island to formally assess the likely costs. McMahon Services have completed two significant vessel dismantling and disposal projects. They scuttled both the ex-HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span> and the ex-HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide </span>to create military dive wrecks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to advise that the Fraser Coast Regional Council has just this week committed $1 million towards the project. That is from a local government authority. I hope that Bundaberg Regional Council will soon follow their lead and that the Queensland state Labor government will get on board. I would like to thank our patron senator, Senator James McGrath, now Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, for his longstanding support of this project.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the Defence assets paid for by the Australian people can and should continue to serve the community long after they are no longer of use to the military. Make no mistake: HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk </span>should not be sent to the scrap metal yard or to a freezing, dark, watery grave in a place like Tasmania. The Wide Bay Burnett is the ideal resting place for HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk</span>. We are a region that has great respect for the veteran community, and we will treat the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk </span>with the respect that it deserves. The project will be an economic injection and add desperately needed jobs into our region now and for decades into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  We are fast approaching the 20th anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin was a true warrior for Israel and visionary for peace. His death at the hands of a Jewish extremist sent shock waves throughout Israel and the region. The echoes of those gunshots reverberated around the world, touching many here in Australia because the ties between Australia and Israel are deep and enduring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am always proud to remember that it was foreign minister 'Doc' Evatt, one of the intellectual luminaries of the Labor Party, who was the first to vote in the General Assembly in favour of the establishment of Israel under United Nations Resolution 181. In 1949, the Chifley government ensured that Australia was among the first nations to formally recognise the newborn state of Israel. It was Israeli politician and diplomat Abba Eban who, in acknowledging the Australian government's contribution to the recognition of Israel, declared:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the warmth and eloquence with which you welcomed Israel into the family of nations, have earned for you the undying gratitude of our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The enduring friendship that our nation has built with the state of Israel has only grown stronger in the 67 years since its creation. Both of our nations are founded in common democratic values, both of our nations aspire to build nations founded in justice, prosperity and peace and, tragically, both of our nations have also suffered the evils of terrorism—although for Israel the threat is on an altogether different scale to that experienced here. The latest spasm of violence in Israel is appalling to see, with a tragic loss of life on both sides of the conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who have sought to somehow justify the violence, let me say that, whatever the grievances of the Palestinians, indiscriminate murder will never be a legitimate form of political protest. It is terrorism and it is abhorrent. This latest violence reinforces that we must continue to support a lasting resolution of the conflict, based on the right of Israel to live in peace within secure borders internationally recognised and agreed by the parties and on the realisation of the right of the Palestinian people to also live in peace and security within their own state of Palestine, a state based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed land swaps. There is no other course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But while there is now widespread support for the establishment of a state of Palestine under the terms negotiated by the parties, there is a loud and, I fear, growing chorus opposed to the very existence of the state of Israel. It is imperative that the Palestinian National Authority, Hamas and other Palestinian factions cease all public statements and incitement by their officials and in the media to promote political violence or that are otherwise inimical to the achievement of a peaceful two-state resolution of the conflict. Hamas, which is a listed terrorist organisation under Australian law, must renounce its genocidal charter, commit to re-establishing the rule of law and end summary executions and the persecution of minorities, including in relation to sexual orientation. Israeli leaders too must refrain from rhetoric that seeks to delegitimise the Palestinians and their aspirations to nationhood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Keating was Prime Minister at the time of Rabin's assassination, and he issued a statement which included the following words, which are as true today as they were back in 1995:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Yitzhak Rabin's vision, strength and commitment were instrumental to achieving the breakthrough in the peace process. His death is a tragedy for Israel, the Middle East and the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The best way the world can honour Mr Rabin is to push ahead with the work he began. For Australia's part, we will continue to give our full support to the peace process. Our support for Israel's right to exist in security and safety will remain a guiding principle of our policy.</span>

I will also be visiting with and offering my support to friends and family who live there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go bearing a message of support from my parliamentary colleagues from all sides of politics. In what is often a deeply divided parliament, support for the state of Israel and for the peace process in which she is engaged with the Palestinian people continues to be a matter of rock-solid bipartisan agreement.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  Summer is not too far away, and where better to go in summer than the great beaches of Adelaide. Adelaide is regularly ranked as one of the most livable cities in the world. Not only do we have an enviable lifestyle, world renowned wineries and wine regions but we have pristine beaches where you can enjoy the warm, dry heat of an Aussie summer. I strongly encourage everyone in the House to head down to Adelaide. Many members of the House are cyclists. I know the member for Isaacs is, and I am sure he will be going to Adelaide in January for the Tour Down Under. He is just giving me the thumbs up, which is great to see. The world Tour Down Under not only is a world-class event but it celebrates cycling and also the many festivals that are on in Adelaide at around that time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Hindmarsh is blessed with some of the best beaches I have ever seen—Somerton, Grange; the list goes on—and there are already some great hotels and tourist spots in the region, from Glenelg and Adelaide Shores to Henley Beach. Regarding Henley Beach, the federal government has contributed $2 million to the redevelopment of Henley Square and, when it is completed in a few months time, I am sure it will be a great place for families to go, with new water parks and decking looking out onto the jetty—a great scene down there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of activity happening in Glenelg at the moment too. There is the redevelopment of the foreshore, where the federal government has contributed $500,000 and is working with the council and other stakeholders. This Saturday there will be a fashion parade along the jetty, as part of the Adelaide Fashion Festival. There will be much more than beachwear on show, as Angel Wings, MAN by Jeans Corp and Jophiel showcase their latest summer fashions in the picturesque setting of the jetty at sunset. I was speaking to the owner of The Beachouse where my children love to go and many other children love to be entertained. He is going to be introducing the world's largest inflatable slide at Glenelg over the summer, so I am looking forward to seeing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent figures show that Jetty Road, the main tourist strip, has recorded its lowest vacancy rate in six years. This is great news for the local area. Tourists spent about $2 million in Glenelg last year, with 175,000 overnight visitors and almost a million daytrippers. The Jetty Road Mainstreet Management Committee has been championing a new project to have a hotel at the end of the jetty. While it is at an early stage, the committee has commissioned consultancy firm Mott MacDonald to develop concept plans. I have met with several of the people involved and I commend them for coming up with something innovative and visionary. No-one is sure what the final plans will look like or how it will end up, but this is an exciting project. The Holdfast Bay council are right behind it. Linda Johnson, the manager of the Jetty Road Mainstreet Management Committee; chairman Mark Faulkner; and Mike Deare have all been involved in various capacities during the project and, along with many others, should be commended for having a go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adelaide, like Australia, needs more four-and five-star hotels. From speaking to the previous tourism minister, Andrew Robb, I know he was always outlining the potential and the need for our tourism infrastructure to be improved. I take heart from the fact that there is some activity and that there are some new projects, such as the one Holdfast Bay council is looking at. In addition, businessman Bruno Marveggio and the state government have announced plans to allow buildings over 10 storeys on the foreshore of Adelphi Terrace along the Anzac Highway, Jetty Road and Pier Street. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By 2020, almost 200 million Chinese tourists are expected to travel internationally, a doubling of current numbers. This is where some of the growth potential is. I was just speaking with the new tourism minister, Richard Colbeck, about the Indian market and the potential there as well. We know that is a real growth area. Australia is well placed to capitalise on this rising demand, but, as I have mentioned, we need significant investment in tourism infrastructure. We need to look at new and iconic hotels that offer international visitors a unique experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tourism Research Australia has released some figures on tourism numbers for the last financial year that show an increase of seven per cent to a new high of 6.6 million visitors. International visitor spend grew by 10 per cent to a record $33.4 billion, or $3.2 billion more than the previous year, and visitor nights increased eight per cent. But South Australia has missed out on this increase and the number of tourists to South Australia fell from 388,000 to 385,000. This is not good enough. The embattled South Australian Minister for Tourism has been under fire for many things over recent months, but if he keeps performing badly South Australia will miss out. We are the only state not to experience an increase in the number of tourists. Tasmania was up 22 per cent, Victoria 11 per cent and Queensland eight per cent. Tourism is a growing industry and an important one. It means more jobs and more economic prosperity for our country. </span>

I was very sad to hear at that event that the CEO of the National Stroke Foundation, Dr Erin Lalor, was retiring. I have had a working relationship with Erin over a number of years and she has made a fantastic contribution in this area. She has been the CEO of the National Stroke Foundation since 2002 and prior to that she was a speech therapist. She has twice been nominated, in 2007 and 2013, for the Victorian Telstra Business Woman of the Year award. In addition, she was listed in 2013 in the top 100 women of influence in Australia. Erin worked as a speech pathologist prior to undertaking research into stroke services and language impairment, and completed her PhD in cognitive neuropsychology in 1997. She represents the Stroke Foundation on the National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance and the Australian Chronic Disease Prevention Alliance, and is co-chair of the Australian Stroke Coalition, director of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, chair of the AIHW National Vascular Diseases Monitoring Advisory Group as well as a director of the World Stroke Organization and a member of the World Stroke Campaign Committee. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Erin has lobbied strongly over a number of years on behalf of people who have been living with stroke. She has made an enormous contribution in this space. She has raised the prominence of stroke within this parliament. She has met with many, many people over time and has been instrumental in a number of changes that have occurred in that space. Whilst talking about Erin, it is important to note that cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer in Australia. Cardiovascular disease is heart stroke and blood diseases. It kills one Australian every 12 minutes. It affects more than one in six Australians—that is, 3.72 million people. In 2012-13, there were over 500,000 hospitalisations, and that number is only going to grow with our ageing population. We need to take cardiovascular disease very seriously. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I spoke at a Heart Foundation seminar here in Parliament House. The focus of that seminar was 'move more, sit less'. Out of that came an argument for Australia to have a national physical activity action plan. I am strongly supportive of that notion. It does not need to be something that costs a lot of money. Physical inactivity causes 14,000 deaths each year. It is imperative that we have in place a plan that is going to enable Australians to be more active and for children to walk and cycle to school. We need to support local government to deliver better places and infrastructure for physical activity and to support children to engage in physical activity—sport and recreation—and to provide for the needs of all Australians, young and old, to see that they remain more active. I will finish where I started by thanking Dr Erin Lalor for her enormous contribution. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  In my maiden speech as the member for Robertson, I pledged to stand up every single day to champion the concerns, the aspirations and the hopes of the people in my electorate. Two years in and I have been working really hard every day to deliver on this as part of the coalition's positive growth plan for the Central Coast, including our No. 1 commitment: 600 new jobs for Gosford. In a region with around 30,000 commuters leaving home early in the morning for work and returning late to their families at night, this is vitally important. We know the flow-on effects this plan will have for our region. I am proud of the coalition government's commitment to these 600 jobs to be located in a purpose-built, A-grade building in Gosford. But it is important that the purpose-built building not only stands the test of time in terms of construction and use, as I have no doubt it will, but also that the aesthetic design stands the test of time as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am advised that the site chosen by the ATO for the building that we know as the Commonwealth centre of excellence is on less than 30 per cent of the old Gosford Public School site and that the school site itself is around 10 per cent of the area that we know as the Gosford waterfront precinct. I am further advised by the Central Coast Regional Development Corporation that the total land area rezoned as the waterfront precinct is 10 hectares. So the building to be leased by the ATO when construction is complete is slated to be on just four per cent of that land area. The community was promised an A-grade centre of excellence and I have absolutely no doubt it will be. But I have to say, based on the only available image of the new building that has been released so far by the ATO, that the current design does not seem appropriate for the site. Unfortunately the most common description I have heard from people in my community about the design is that it is ugly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to why I am raising this matter today. Because we were told it would be a centre of excellence, I believe that the community is saying to me they expect the aesthetic design to also match that commitment so that it can be something our region can be truly proud of in 10 and 20 years time. I do recognise, of course, that the building is ultimately a matter for the constructors, the ATO and council, but I have to agree with my community that what we really need is a top-notch building design for our region. Unfortunately the style of this building, at least from what we can see based on a single two-sided picture, would seem to be at odds with the design elements of other building projects that are currently being proposed nearby. I will be formally raising my concerns and my community's concerns with the ATO about the aesthetics of what has been proposed for this building. I must admit that I have been somewhat frustrated at the lack of interaction between the ATO and my community regarding the design since the announcement of the site location was made a few weeks ago. I do respect the process. This tender process was a thorough, open-market competitive tender process run at arm's length to me and the government. But the design of the building, at least from what we have seen so far, simply does not meet community expectations. We need a vibrant, appropriate design that reflects our future as a region of world-class excellence and opportunity, and does not reflect perhaps what we have seen in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were high hopes for this project in my community, because of the massive economic benefit it is going to bring. These 600 jobs to Gosford are not in doubt, but unfortunately Labor's anti-jobs, anti-infrastructure agenda has seen weeks of political stunts that seek to delay these 600 jobs coming to Gosford and fan misconceptions and false claims simply as a smokescreen to cover the fact that Labor has never supported our plan for 600 jobs for Gosford. As I embark on a month of roundtables listening to residents and businesses in my electorate, I want to hear more from more people in my community, because I strongly believe that we can deliver on the concerns, aspirations and hopes of people on the Central Coast. I strongly believe that by working together we can one day have it all: 600 jobs, a performing arts centre and a bustling cultural hub, and a city that draws people to the Central Coast for even more growth, jobs and opportunities. But first we must have an appropriately designed building that reflects these aspirations, and I will work for my community for this. We deserve no less.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) Yes. All States and Territories require mandatory registration for electricians. State and Territory authorities conduct skills assessments as part of the registration application process. This is in addition to the visa skills and/​or qualification assessments which can be required by the Department prior to approving a visa. Only qualified electricians are eligible to be granted a 457 visa.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) The Department reviews evidence of qualification as part of the visa application process, and where any doubt exists refers applicants to Trades Recognition Australia for verification of skills and qualifications. In addition, skills based assessments are undertaken by State and Territory governments as part of the registration licensing process for electricians.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) The relevant State or Territory registration body will determine if there are any gap training requirements. </span>
